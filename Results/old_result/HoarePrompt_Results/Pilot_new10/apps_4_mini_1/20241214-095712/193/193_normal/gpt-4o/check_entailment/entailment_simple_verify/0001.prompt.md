You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Memory is now interested in the de-evolution of objects, specifically triangles. He starts with an equilateral triangle of side length x, and he wishes to perform operations to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y.

In a single second, he can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area). At any moment of time, the length of each side should be integer.

What is the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y?


-----Input-----

The first and only line contains two integers x and y (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000) — the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length x.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
4

Input
8 5

Output
3

Input
22 4

Output
6



-----Note-----

In the first sample test, Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length 6 and wants one of side length 3. Denote a triangle with sides a, b, and c as (a, b, c). Then, Memory can do $(6,6,6) \rightarrow(6,6,3) \rightarrow(6,4,3) \rightarrow(3,4,3) \rightarrow(3,3,3)$.

In the second sample test, Memory can do $(8,8,8) \rightarrow(8,8,5) \rightarrow(8,5,5) \rightarrow(5,5,5)$.

In the third sample test, Memory can do: $(22,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,22) \rightarrow(7,22,16) \rightarrow(7,10,16) \rightarrow(7,10,4) \rightarrow$

$(7,4,4) \rightarrow(4,4,4)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the given program, let's break down its functionality based on the problem description:

1. We start with an equilateral triangle of side length `x`.
2. We want to reduce the side length to `y`, maintaining the properties of a non-degenerate triangle.
3. The program calculates the number of seconds required to achieve the desired side length by running the following logic:
   - It uses the formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`.

Let's explore what this formula computes:
- `(x - y) // 2` computes how many pairs of side reductions can happen together (since all sides are initially equal).
- `(x - y) % 2` checks if there's an odd difference, meaning we'll need one additional second to make a final adjustment.

Although the computation appears to give a result based on the differences in side lengths, it does not fully verify whether at each step the triangle remains a non-degenerate triangle. 

A degenerate triangle occurs when the sum of the lengths of any two sides equals or is less than the length of the third side. In our case, we always have three sides equal to `x` initially, and the goal is to reduce those sides to `y`. However, if `x` and `y` are too close to each other or if rounding values lead to a scenario where two sides are longer than the remaining side, this needs careful observation.

To see if there is a flaw, let's test an edge case:
- Consider `x = 4` and `y = 3`.
- The expected progression based on the reductions would be `(4,4,4) -> (4,4,3) -> (4,3,3) -> (3,3,3)`. The outcome correctly matches the desired triangle.
  
Now, let's try `x = 5` and `y = 3`.
- The progression should be `(5,5,5) -> (5,5,4) -> (5,4,4) -> (4,4,4)`, but applying the formula yields `(5 - 3) // 2 + (5 - 3) % 2 = 1 + 0 = 1`, which wrongly suggests only 1 second is needed.

This indicates that the formula might yield incorrect time calculations under certain conditions.

**Conclusion**: 

The current logic doesn't ensure the properties of a non-degenerate triangle are upheld adequately across all scenarios, particularly small differences.

Correctness: **False**. 

The flaw arises since the program outputs an incorrect minimum number of seconds for certain cases where it does not maintain valid triangle properties throughout the transition.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000.
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
