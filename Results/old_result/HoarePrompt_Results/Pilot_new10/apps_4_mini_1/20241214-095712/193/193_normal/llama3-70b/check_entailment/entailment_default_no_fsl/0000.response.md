Correctness: **False**

The provided program calculates the absolute difference between the starting side length `x` and the target side length `y`, which is simply `abs(x - y)`. However, this approach does not account for the additional constraints imposed by the need to maintain a non-degenerate triangle. 

In particular, the problem requires that while modifying the sides, the triangle remains valid, meaning the lengths must always adhere to the triangle inequality rules. The examples in the problem description illustrate that multiple incremental steps are needed to transform `(x, x, x)` into `(y, y, y)` through various intermediate stages, and each of these adjustments impacts the number of operations required.

For example, in the case of starting from side length `x = 6` and aiming for side length `y = 3`, the output should indeed be `4`, as given in the example, but the program outputs `abs(6 - 3) = 3`, which is incorrect. Similarly, for the case of `x = 8` and `y = 5`, the program would also yield an incorrect response.

Thus, the program fails to handle the necessary logic of ensuring non-degenerate triangles during the transition, and as such, it does not fulfill the problem's requirements for all potential cases.
