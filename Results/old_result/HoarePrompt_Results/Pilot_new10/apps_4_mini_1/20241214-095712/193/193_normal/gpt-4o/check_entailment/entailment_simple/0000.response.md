Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to calculate the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from side length x. 

Explanation of the program's logic:

1. The expression `(x - y) // 2` computes how many complete 2-length reductions can be made to transform the triangle's sides from length x to length y.
2. The addition of `(x - y) % 2` accounts for a single extra operation if there is a remainder after dividing the difference `x - y` by 2.

However, the problem states that Memory can modify the length of a single side one at a time to maintain a non-degenerate triangle and reach the target length y, meaning he cannot reduce any of the sides below the target while working to transform the triangle. In reality, to ensure the triangle remains non-degenerate, not all decrements can be made in pairs; certain sequences in decrements may lead to invalid triangle states before reaching (y,y,y).

For example, if x = 8 and y = 5, simply calculating `(8 - 5) // 2 + (8 - 5) % 2 = 3` suggests only 3 operations when in fact, as detailed in the problem examples, it takes 3 operations that involve performing the adjustments step by step, ensuring the triangle remains valid at each operation. The concrete path illustrates several intermediate steps that are not accounted for in the program's approach, thus it oversimplifies the decrement pathway.

In summary, the logic does not encompass all rules for maintaining the integrity of the triangle during the transformations and leads to an incorrect count of operations required.
