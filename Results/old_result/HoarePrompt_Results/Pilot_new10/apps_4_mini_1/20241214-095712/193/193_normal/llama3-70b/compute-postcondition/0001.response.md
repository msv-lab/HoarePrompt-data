The value of `abs(x - y)` is printed, which represents the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given that \( 3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000 \), it implies that \( x - y \) is a positive value, leading to `abs(x - y)` simply being \( x - y \). The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`x` is equal to an input integer, `y` is equal to an input integer such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000; output is the absolute value `x - y`.**
