The function `func` accepts two parameters: `s` and `x`. `s` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq s \leq 10^{12}\), and `x` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq x \leq 10^{12}\). Additionally, it is required that `s` must be greater than `x` for valid pairs (a, b) to exist. 

Since there is no specified output in the provided details, we cannot determine a return value or its conditions. Therefore, we can conclude that the exact functionality regarding the output of the function cannot be defined based on the given information.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `s` (a positive integer) and `x` (a non-negative integer), with the constraints that \(2 \leq s \leq 10^{12}\), \(0 \leq x \leq 10^{12}\), and `s` must be greater than `x` for valid pairs (a, b) to exist. The output or return value is not defined based on the provided information.**
