Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly identifies the longest substring of a given string `s` that is not a palindrome, following the problem description. 

Here’s how the program works and why it meets the requirements:

1. The program reads a string input and calculates its length.
2. It initializes a variable `max_len` to zero, which will store the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found.
3. It uses a nested loop to generate all possible substrings of `s` by varying the start and end indexes.
4. For each substring, it checks if it is not a palindrome (i.e., if the substring is not equal to its reverse).
5. If a non-palindromic substring is found, it compares its length with `max_len` and updates `max_len` accordingly.
6. Finally, it prints `max_len`, or `0` if no non-palindromic substrings were found.

This approach effectively checks all substrings and finds the longest one that is not a palindrome, adhering to the specifications set out in the problem description. 

To further validate, let’s consider the provided examples:

1. For the input "mew":
   - The function should return `3`, since "mew" itself is not a palindrome and is the longest non-palindromic substring.

2. For the input "wuffuw":
   - The longest non-palindromic substrings are "wuffu" and "uffuw", both of length `5`, and the function correctly returns `5`.

3. For the input "qqqqqqqq":
   - All substrings are palindromes, and thus the function should return `0`, which it does.

Since the function produces the expected output for the provided examples and correctly implements the logic to find non-palindromic substrings, I conclude that it is correct for all potential cases within the defined input limits.
