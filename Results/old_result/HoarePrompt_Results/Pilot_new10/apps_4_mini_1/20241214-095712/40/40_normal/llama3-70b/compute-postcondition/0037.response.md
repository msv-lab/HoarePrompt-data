`max_len` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the length of the substring `substr`. Given that `substr` is not equal to its reverse, we know that `len(substr)` is greater than zero and `max_len` will be updated if `len(substr)` is greater than the previous value of `max_len`. The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `substr` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is less than `n`, `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `len(substr)`, and `substr` is equal to `s[i:j]` and `substr` is not equal to its reverse.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is less than `n`, `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and `len(substr)`, `substr` is equal to `s[i:j]`, and `substr` is not equal to its reverse.**
