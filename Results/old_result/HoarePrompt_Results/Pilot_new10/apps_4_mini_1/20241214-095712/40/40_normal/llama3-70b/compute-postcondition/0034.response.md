According to the code, the loop iterates with `j` starting from `i + 1` to `n + 1`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, `i + 1` would be equal to `n + 1`. This means that the starting point of the range for `j` is `n + 1`, and since the range function in Python does not include the endpoint, the loop will not execute at all, as it has no valid range.

To make the loop execute, `i` needs to be less than `n`. Therefore, the necessary adjustment is to reduce `i` by at least 1. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` must be less than `n`, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring of `s`**
