According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at its current value, and `n` is equal to the length of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since `n` is the length of the string `s`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than `n`. If we assume the loop is currently executing for the last value of `i`, at the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `n - 1`. Hence, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n`, meaning `i` will become equal to `n`, which is not less than `n` anymore.

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, we have:
- `i` must be incremented to `n`, completing the loop.
- `max_len` remains defined based on the properties of `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not equal to its reverse, `i` is equal to `n`**.
