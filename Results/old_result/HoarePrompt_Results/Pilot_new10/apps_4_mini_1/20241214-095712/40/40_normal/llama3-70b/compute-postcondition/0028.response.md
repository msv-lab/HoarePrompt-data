According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and `j`. The loop will continue to run while `j` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n + 1`, which means the loop has just finished and is set to exit. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be equal to `n + 1`, and since `j` will increment by 1 for each iteration, `j` must now be `n + 2`, which would not allow the loop to run again. 

Thus, to check conditions under which the loop can run one more time, `j` needs to be reset to its previous value before the last increment, which is `n + 1`, and `i` will remain as `n - 1`. The length of substring `substr` remains as `s[n - 1:n + 1]`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, and `substr` is equal to `s[n - 1:n + 1]`**.
