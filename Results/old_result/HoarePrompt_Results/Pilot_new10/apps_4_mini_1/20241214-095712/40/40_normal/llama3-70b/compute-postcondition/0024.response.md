In this scenario, we have the following conditions:

- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of lowercase English letters.
- `n` is the length of the string `s`.
- `i` is equal to `n - 1`, which means `i` is the last index of `s`.
- `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `n - 1` to `j`, and `substr` is checked against its reverse.

The `for` loop is structured as follows:
```
for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

Here, `i + 1` equals `n`, so the loop starts at `n` and goes up to `n + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration:
- The current value of `j` is equal to `n` (the starting point of the loop), and the loop has not executed yet for a new value.
- For the loop to execute at least once more, `j` should increment by 1. When `j` is incremented, it will be `n + 1`, which is the limit of the loop.

Thus, we keep:
- `s` remains the same.
- `n` remains the length of `s`.
- `i` remains `n - 1`.
- `substr` will be the substring from index `n - 1` to `n + 1`.

So now we need to adjust for `j` which becomes `n + 1`. The check of `substr` will not occur because it indicates that `j` has exceeded the string length.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is equal to n - 1, `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `n - 1` to `n + 1`, and `j` is equal to n + 1.**
