Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements laid out in the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads a non-empty string `s` containing lowercase English letters. It ensures that input is properly stripped of whitespace.

2. **Palindrome Checking**: The function `func_1(s)` is designed to check if a string `s` is a palindrome. It accurately returns `True` if `s` reads the same forwards and backwards and `False` otherwise.

3. **Decision Logic**:
   - If the length of `s` is less than or equal to 1, the program correctly returns `0`, since any string of this length is either empty or a single character, both of which are palindromes.
   - If `s` is not a palindrome (i.e., `not func_1(s)` is `True`), the program correctly returns the length of `s`, since the longest non-palindrome substring is the string itself.
   - If the string becomes a palindrome by removing the first character (`s[1:]`), but remains a non-palindrome when removing the last character (`s[:-1]`), it appropriately returns `len(s) - 1`.
   - In cases where removing either the first or last character still results in a palindrome, it will return `0`, conforming to the problem requirement that no non-palindrome substring exists.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program accounts for:
   - Strings of minimal length (1 character).
   - Strings with all identical characters (for example, "qqqqqqqq"), correctly identifying that they do not contain non-palindromic substrings and returning `0`.

Overall, the logic positively handles all the conditions stipulated in the problem description derived from the examples given. Thus, the program correctly implements the requirements, providing accurate outputs for all potential cases.
