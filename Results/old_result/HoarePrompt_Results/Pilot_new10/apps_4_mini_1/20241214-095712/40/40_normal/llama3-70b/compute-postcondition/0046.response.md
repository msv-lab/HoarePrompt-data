Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is equal to `n`, and `substr` is equal to `s[i:n]`. If `substr` is not a palindrome, then `max_len` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `n - i`.***
