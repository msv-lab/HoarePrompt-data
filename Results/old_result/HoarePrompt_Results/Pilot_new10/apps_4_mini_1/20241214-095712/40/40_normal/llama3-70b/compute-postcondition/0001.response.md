The variable `n` is assigned the value of `len(s)`, which calculates the length of the non-empty string `s` containing only lowercase English letters. Since `s` is a non-empty string, `n` will hold a positive integer value representing the number of characters in `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters; `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `s`.**
