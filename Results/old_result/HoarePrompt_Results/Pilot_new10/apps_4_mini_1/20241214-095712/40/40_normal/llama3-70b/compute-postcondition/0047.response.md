Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is unchanged, `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindromic substring of `s` or 0 if there are no non-palindromic substrings. The loop executes from `j = i + 1` to `n + 1`, and if any substring `s[i:j]` is not a palindrome, `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the length of that substring.**
