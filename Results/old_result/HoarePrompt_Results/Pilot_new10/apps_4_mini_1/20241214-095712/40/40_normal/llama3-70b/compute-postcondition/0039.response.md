According to the code, the loop iterates over a range based on `j`, which starts from `i + 1` and goes to `n + 1`. The loop continues as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n`. If the previous iteration was the last one where `j` was equal to `n`, after the iteration `j` will become `n + 1`, causing the loop to terminate since it will no longer satisfy the range condition. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `n`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be `n + 1`, and `i` remains unchanged (assuming it's not modified within the loop). 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is unchanged, `j` is n + 1**.
