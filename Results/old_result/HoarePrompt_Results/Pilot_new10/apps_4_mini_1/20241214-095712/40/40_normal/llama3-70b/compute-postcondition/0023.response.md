Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is equal to n - 1, and `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `n - 1` to `j`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is updated to the maximum of `max_len` and the length of `substr`.***
