To analyze the impact of the code on the initial state:

1. `max_len` will be updated to the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.
2. The variable `substr` is equal to `s[n - 1]`, which is the last character of the string `s`.
3. The length of a single character (which is what `substr` represents) is 1.

Thus, we need to evaluate the expression `max(max_len, len(substr))`, which translates to `max(max_len, 1)`.

Other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`) are not affected by this line of code. Therefore, the output state includes all valid information and reflects the updated value of `max_len`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `j` is equal to `n + 1`, `substr` is equal to `s[n - 1]`, and `max_len` is max(`max_len`, 1)**.
