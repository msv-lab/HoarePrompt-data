Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty string `s` consisting only of lowercase English letters (length up to 50) and calculates the length of the longest substring that is not a palindrome. If all substrings of `s` are palindromic, the function returns 0. However, the way the function operates does not adequately handle the case where there might be no non-palindromic substrings, especially when all characters in the string are the same; it could mistakenly assume there are non-palindromic substrings when there are not. In summary, it identifies the maximum length of non-palindromic substrings and outputs that length or 0 if none exist. **
