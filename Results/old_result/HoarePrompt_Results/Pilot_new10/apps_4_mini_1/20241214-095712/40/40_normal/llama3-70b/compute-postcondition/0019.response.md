According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and the value of `n`. The loop initializes `j` with `i + 1` and iterates until `j` is less than or equal to `n`. For the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be less than or equal to `n`. Given that `i` is equal to `n`, `i + 1` will be equal to `n + 1`, which is greater than `n`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute in its current state.

To modify the state for the loop to execute, we need to adjust `i` to be less than `n`. A valid adjustment could be to set `i` to `n - 1`, allowing the loop to start with `j` equal to `n`. Additionally, other states like `s`, `n`, and `max_len` do not need to change for the loop to execute, as they don't affect the loop's ability to run.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not equal to its reverse, `i` is equal to n - 1**
