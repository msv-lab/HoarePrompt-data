The line of code `substr = s[i:j]` is intended to assign a substring of `s` to the variable `substr`. The variables involved are `s`, `i`, `j`, and `substr`. 

1. Since `i` is equal to `n - 1`, it represents the index of the last character of the string `s` (as indexing starts from 0).
2. The variable `j` is currently not defined in the initial state, which means it defaults to an undefined state. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact value of `substr` without a value for `j`.
3. The length `n` is equal to the length of the non-empty string `s`, and we'll keep this information but since `j` is not given, we cannot specify `substr`'s value directly.

We can conclude that `substr` will hold a value depending on the value of `j`, and since `j` is undefined in the initial state, the outcome must reflect that. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is equal to the length of `s`, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not equal to its reverse, `i` is equal to n - 1, and `substr` is the substring of `s` from index `n - 1` to `j` (with j undefined).**
