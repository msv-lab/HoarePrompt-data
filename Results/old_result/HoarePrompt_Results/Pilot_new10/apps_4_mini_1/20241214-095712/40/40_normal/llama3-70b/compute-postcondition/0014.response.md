The variable `substr` is assigned the value of `s[i:j]`. Given that `i` is 0 and `j` is 3, `substr` will now equal `s[0:3]`, which is the first three characters of the string `s`. The values of `n` (which is still greater than or equal to 3), `i`, `j`, and `s` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing only lowercase English letters, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `substr` is equal to `s[0:3]`**.
