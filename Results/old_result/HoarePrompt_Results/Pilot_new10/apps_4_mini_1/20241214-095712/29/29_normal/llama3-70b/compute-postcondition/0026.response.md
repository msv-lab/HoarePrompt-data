The code appends a new entry to the `script` list in the format `'move {file} {i}'`. The variable `file` is the first part of the entry, while `i` is specified to be at least 3. The conditions specify that `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to 100,000, `files` is sorted based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` has at least one element, and `regular` contains at least `len(examples) + 2` entries. 

After appending the new entry, the state of `script` changes as it now includes an additional formatted string. The output state needs to reflect this change and maintain all the other given conditions remaining valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` must have at least 1 element, `script` has an updated entry appended with format 'move {file} {i}' where `i` is at least 3, and `regular` must have at least `len(examples) + 2` entries.**
