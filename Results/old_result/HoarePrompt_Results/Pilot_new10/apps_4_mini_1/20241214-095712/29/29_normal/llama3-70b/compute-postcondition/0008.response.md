According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than the number of times the loop has already executed. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2. If the loop has executed one time, that would mean `n` must be greater than 1 for another execution. Therefore, after this iteration, `n` must be at least 2, and since we've completed one iteration, we expect the loop to run for the second time.

State: **`n` is at least 2, `files` contains at least two tuples: the original tuple and a new tuple (`name`, `int(type_)`)**
