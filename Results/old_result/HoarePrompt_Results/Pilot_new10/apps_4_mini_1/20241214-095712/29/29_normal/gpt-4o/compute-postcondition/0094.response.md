Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `temp_counter` has incremented by a number of times equal to the number of iterations of the loop; `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`; `examples` still contains all filenames with potentially updated string representations; `moves` includes all commands added during the loop execution; `regulars[i]` is the final `str(temp_counter)`, where `i` remains less than or equal to `len(regulars)`; `target` is equal to `len(examples) + i + 1`.**
