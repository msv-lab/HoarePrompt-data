The code snippet appends a formatted string to the `moves` list. The value `examples[i]` refers to the filename at index `i`, which is `2`, and `i + 1` equals `3`. Since the current value of `examples[i]` is not equal to `str(i + 1)`, the condition holds true.

Given that `examples` contains at least three filenames and `i` is currently `2`, it means that `examples[2]` is the third filename in the list. This filename is appended to the `moves` list with its respective index incremented by 1.

Since no other variables are affected by this operation, the output state is: `examples` contains at least 3 filenames, `temp_counter` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `moves` now includes the string `move {examples[2]} 3`.

Output State: **`examples` contains at least 3 filenames, `temp_counter` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `moves` now includes 'move {examples[2]} 3'**
