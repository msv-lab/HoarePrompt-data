Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of n tuples containing filenames and types, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is an empty list.

Output State after the loop executes 0 times: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is an empty list, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is an empty list. 

Output State after the loop executes 1 time: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of n tuples containing filenames and types, `file` is the first tuple in `files`. If the type of `file` is '1', then `examples` has one additional element, `name`. Otherwise, if the type is not equal to '1', `regulars` has one additional element, `name`.

Output State after the loop executes n times: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of n tuples containing filenames and types. `examples` contains all filenames corresponding to entries in `files` with type '1', and `regulars` contains all filenames corresponding to entries in `files` with type other than '1'.

Output State: **`examples` contains all filenames from `files` with type '1', `regulars` contains all filenames from `files` with type not equal to '1', `files` is a list of n tuples containing filenames and types.**
