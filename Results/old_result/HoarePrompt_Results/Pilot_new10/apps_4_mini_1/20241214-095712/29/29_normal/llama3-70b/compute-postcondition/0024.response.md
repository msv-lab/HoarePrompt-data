In this case, `script` will have a new entry appended to it. The element being appended is constructed using the values of `file` and `i`. Since `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, we don't know the specific value of `file`, but we know it corresponds to some element in `files`.

The step by step impact of the code:
- `i` is already defined as `len(examples) + 1` which is at least 2 (since `examples` has at least 1 element).
- `script` will have an entry appended with the format `f'move {file} {i}'`, where `file` is the current file from the `files` list based on the loop or context (although the exact context isn't provided).

Thus, the updated output state after the execution is:
- `script` now has an additional string formatted as `move {file} {i}`.
- The variables `n`, `files`, and `examples` remain unchanged from their initial state.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` must have at least 1 element, `script` has an updated entry appended with format 'move {file} {i}', where `i` is equal to `len(examples) + 1` and `i` is at least 2.**
