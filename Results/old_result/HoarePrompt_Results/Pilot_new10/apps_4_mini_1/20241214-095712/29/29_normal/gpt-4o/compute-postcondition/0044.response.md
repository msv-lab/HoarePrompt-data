The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since it was initially greater than 6, it will now be greater than 7. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `examples` contains at least 2 filenames, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is greater than 7, and `n` is greater than 3.

Output State: **`examples` contains at least 2 filenames, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is greater than 7, and `n` is greater than 3**.
