The variable `moves` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables, `examples` and `regulars`, remain unchanged since they are not affected by this initialization. The outputs state reflects the current status of `moves`, alongside the existing information about `examples` and `regulars`.

Output State: **`examples` contains all filenames from `files` with type '1', `regulars` contains all filenames from `files` with type not equal to '1', `moves` is an empty list.**
