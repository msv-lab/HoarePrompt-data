Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` strings representing filenames and their associated types (0 for regular tests and 1 for example tests). It generates and returns a list of move commands to reorganize the filenames based on their types. If filenames are not in their expected positions, it generates commands to move them to new temporary positions or to their final target positions, while ensuring that each filename's representation conforms to a specific ordering. The code does not handle potential cases where the `files` list may contain invalid entries or types beyond the expected '0' and '1', nor does it enforce the correctness of the input formatting for filenames.**
