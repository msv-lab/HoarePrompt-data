`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. Since `temp_counter` is initially greater than 4, its new value will be greater than 5. The other variables remain unaffected. Hence, the Output State reflects that `temp_counter` is now greater than 5, while `examples` still contains at least 2 filenames, and `i` remains 1, with `examples[1]` still being a string representation of the initial value of `temp_counter`.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than 5, `examples` contains at least 2 filenames, `i` is 1, `examples[1]` is a string representation of the initial value of `temp_counter`.**
