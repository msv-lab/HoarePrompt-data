The code snippet `script = []` initializes the variable `script` as an empty list. It does not affect any of the previous variables like `n`, `files`, `examples`, or `regular` since they are completely unaffected by this operation. 

Therefore, the output state will retain the existing information from the initial state but will reflect that `script` is now set to an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0, `script` is an empty list.**
