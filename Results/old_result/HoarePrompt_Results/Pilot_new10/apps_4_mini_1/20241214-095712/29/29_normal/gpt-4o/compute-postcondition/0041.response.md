According to the code, the loop can continue executing as long as both conditions, `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`, are satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `temp_counter` is greater than 5. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `temp_counter` must be adjusted to be less than or equal to `2 * n`. Since `temp_counter` is currently greater than 5, `2 * n` must also be adjusted to be greater than 5, which means `n` must be adjusted so that `2 * n` is at least greater than 5, thus `n` must be greater than 2.5 (in integer terms, `n` must be at least 3).

Additionally, the condition `str(temp_counter) in files_set` must also be maintained, implying `temp_counter` should correspond to a valid filename in `files_set`.

Therefore, to maintain the ability for the loop to execute one more time: 
- `n` must now be greater than 2.5
- `temp_counter` must still be in `files_set`.

State: **`examples` contains at least 2 filenames, `i` is 1, `temp_counter` is greater than 5, and `n` must be greater than 2.5**
