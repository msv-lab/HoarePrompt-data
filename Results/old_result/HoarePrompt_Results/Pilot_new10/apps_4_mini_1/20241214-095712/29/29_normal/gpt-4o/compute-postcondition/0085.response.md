Postcondition: ***`examples` contains all filenames with potentially updated string representations. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `moves` includes an additional command `move {regulars[i]} {target}`; `temp_counter` is increased by 1, remaining within the bounds defined (greater than or equal to `n + 1 + the number of moves appended` and less than or equal to `2 * n + the number of iterations executed`). `files_set` includes `str(temp_counter)`; `regulars[i]` is now `str(temp_counter)` and `regulars[i]` is confirmed to be not equal to `str(target)`.***
