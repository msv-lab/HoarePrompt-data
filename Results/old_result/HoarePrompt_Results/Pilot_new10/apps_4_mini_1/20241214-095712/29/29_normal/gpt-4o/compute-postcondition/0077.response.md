`temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `temp_counter` is between 1 and `2 * n + 1`, ensuring it will remain within that range after the increment. The variable `temp_counter` will now reflect its previous value plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to `2 * n + 2`, `str(temp_counter)` must be included in `files_set`**.
