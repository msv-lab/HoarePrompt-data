The code sorts the list `files` in descending order based on the second element of each tuple (the integer `type_`). The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer ranging from 1 to 100000, and `files` contains `n` tuples. After the execution of the sort operation, the list `files` will be updated to reflect the new ordering based on the specified key.

The values of `n` and the tuples in `files` do not change, just their order in `files`. Therefore, the output state provides the new ordered list of tuples without altering the original tuple values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple (the integer type_)**
