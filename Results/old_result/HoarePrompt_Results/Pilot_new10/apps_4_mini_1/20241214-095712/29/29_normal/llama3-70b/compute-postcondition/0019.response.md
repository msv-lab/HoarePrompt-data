The code `script.append(f'move {file} {i}')` will append a new string to the `script` list. This string is formed by substituting the value of `file` and `i` into the format string. The current value of `file` is set to the second element of `examples`, and `i` is equal to 2. Therefore, the new string will be `f'move {file} {i}'`, which evaluates to `f'move {second_element_of_examples} 2'`.

The state of other variables (`n`, `files`, `examples`) is unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` must have at least 2 elements, `script` contains the string 'move {file} 1' and 'move {file} 2' where `file` is the second element in `examples`, `i` is 2.**
