Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of n tuples containing filenames and types, and `file` is the first tuple in `files`. If the type of `file` is '1', then `examples` has one additional element, `name`. Otherwise, if the type is not equal to '1', `regulars` is updated to include the value of `name`, which corresponds to the filename from `file`.***
