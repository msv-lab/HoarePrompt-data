Postcondition: ***`examples` contains all filenames with potentially updated string representations. If `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`, then `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, `i` has been updated to equal `len(regulars)`, `moves` includes the commands `move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}` and `move {regulars[i]} {target}` appended, and `regulars[i]` is updated to equal `str(temp_counter + 1)`.***
