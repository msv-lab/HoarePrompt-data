The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The initial conditions state that `temp_counter` must be equal to or less than `2 * n - 1`, meaning it can take on a maximum value of `2 * n - 1`. Thus, after incrementing, `temp_counter` will be within the valid range, confirming that it now holds a value greater than or equal to 0 and less than or equal to `2 * n`. The value of `i` remains unchanged, and the validity of `str(temp_counter + 1)` being in `files_set` does not change either.

Output State: **`examples` contains at least 1 filename, `i` is 0, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1 (now 1 or more and â‰¤ `2 * n`), `str(temp_counter + 1)` is in `files_set`.**
