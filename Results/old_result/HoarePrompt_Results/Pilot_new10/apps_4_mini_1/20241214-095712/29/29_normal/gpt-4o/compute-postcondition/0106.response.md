To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided conditions step-by-step.

The loop condition is:
```
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `temp_counter` is currently `temp_counter + 1`, which is less than or equal to `2 * n`. Therefore, we need `temp_counter` to be at least `temp_counter + 1` and still satisfy the condition of being less than or equal to `2 * n`. This means that after the increment, it must remain valid, thus `temp_counter` would need to be adjusted to ensure this is possible.
- `str(temp_counter)` is still in `files_set`. We need to check that the value of `temp_counter` after its increment remains in `files_set`.
- We don't have explicit values for `n` or the `files_set`, but we can ascertain that `temp_counter` should be adjusted to ensure it can still validate `str(temp_counter)` in `files_set`.

Since `temp_counter` has just been incremented, we want it to again be within the bounds of being less than or equal to `2 * n`, and we also need it to be in `files_set` after the increment. 

From the provided state, we determine:
1. If `temp_counter + 1` is still less than or equal to `2 * n`, then this condition holds and doesn't need adjustment.
2. We need to check the value of `str(temp_counter + 1)` to ensure that it remains in `files_set` after this increment.

Thus, we can state our required adjustments:
State: **`moves` includes the new command `move str(temp_counter) len(examples) + i + 1`, `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`**
