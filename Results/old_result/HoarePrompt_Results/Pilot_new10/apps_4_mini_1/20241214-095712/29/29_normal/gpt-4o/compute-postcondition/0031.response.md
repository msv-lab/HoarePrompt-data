The code appends a formatted string to the `moves` list. The values of `temp_counter` and `examples[i]` are used in the string, and since `temp_counter` is guaranteed to be greater than 2, the result of `temp_counter + 1` means `temp_counter` is still relevant in its final state as incremented (but we don't know how many times the loop executes, so it may not have changed yet). The conditions of the loop indicate that it would execute based on the values and membership of `files_set`.

Since `moves` is being modified by appending the formatted string during the loop iteration, the total information leading up to the changes will remain valid.

Output State: **`temp_counter` is greater than 2, `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`, `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, the string `move {examples[i]} {temp_counter}` has been appended to `moves`.**
