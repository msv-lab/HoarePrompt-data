The variable `script` is updated by appending a new entry which is formatted as 'move {file} {i}'. The preconditions state that `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, and that `script` already has updated entries, indicating that it is a list of strings. The variable `i` is not explicitly defined in the current state, but it is used as part of the formatting. Thus, the entry added to `script` will reflect the last known or assumed value of `file` and `i`.

Assuming `file` is a specific file from the `files` list and `i` has a specific value (which is likely to be an integer), the output state will show that an additional move command has been added to the `script`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` must have at least 1 element, `script` has an updated entry 'move {file} {i}' appended, and `regular` must have at least 4 entries.**
