According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `script`. If the `script` has at least one more `line`, the loop can run once more. At the end of the last iteration, `script` is non-empty, indicating there are still lines available to iterate over. 

Given that the loop progresses through each `line` in `script` sequentially, the next state would need `line` to represent the next `line` in the `script`, and the current index of `line` should be incremented by one.

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `script` is non-empty, `examples` must not be empty, `line` is the next line in the script**
