The variables `name` and `type_` are assigned the values from the `input` function, which splits the input string on whitespace. The variable `files` remains an empty list, and the value of `n` is unaffected by this line of code. Therefore, the outcome reflects that `name` and `type_` will now hold the string values provided through input. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `files` is an empty list, `name` is an input string, `type_` is another input string**.
