According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `temp_counter`, `n`, and the condition checking if `str(temp_counter)` is in `files_set`. The loop will execute again if `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n` and if `str(temp_counter)` is present in `files_set`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `i` is 2
- `temp_counter` is currently at most 10 and is now 10 
- `n` must be at least 3, therefore `2 * n` must be at least 6 (making `temp_counter` being 10 valid for this part of the condition)
- `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set` implies that `str(10)` must be in `files_set`.

To execute one more time, `temp_counter` would need to be adjusted:
1. While `temp_counter` is at 10, the condition `temp_counter <= 2 * n` holds true since `n` is at least 3, thus this part does not require adjustment if `temp_counter` goes beyond 10.
2. `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set` already holds true since it was specified as a condition for the loop to execute.

Since we need the loop to be able to execute if `temp_counter` needs to be incremented (which it must be in the next iteration if it is to continue), we need to specify that `temp_counter` must be less than 10 in order to allow for an additional step in the next iteration.

Therefore, no other states need to be adjusted except for the following: 

State: **`examples` contains at least 3 filenames, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` must be less than 10, `n` must be at least 3, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**.
