Precondition: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) representing the number of files with tests, and files is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains a string (the filename) consisting of digits and small English letters (length from 1 to 6), and an integer (type) which is either 0 or 1, indicating whether the file is a regular test (0) or an example test (1). The filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.**
