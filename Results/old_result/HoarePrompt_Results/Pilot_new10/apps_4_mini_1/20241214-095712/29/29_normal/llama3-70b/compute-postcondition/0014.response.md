The variable `regular` is assigned a list comprehension that filters the tuples in `files`. It selects the first element of each tuple where the second element is equal to 0. The initial state mentions that `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, but since we only use the second element for filtering (not for order), the sort order does not affect the outcome.

The output state will indicate what `regular` now holds, in result of the filtering based on the condition provided.

Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 1, `regular` is a list of the first elements of tuples from `files` where the second element is equal to 0.**
