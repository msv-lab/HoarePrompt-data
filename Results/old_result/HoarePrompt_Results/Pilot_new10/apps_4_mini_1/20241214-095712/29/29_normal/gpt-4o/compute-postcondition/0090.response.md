To determine the required adjustments to the program state for the `while` loop to execute one more time, we analyze the loop condition:

```python
while temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set:
```

The loop can continue if:
1. `temp_counter` is less than or equal to `2 * n`
2. `str(temp_counter)` is contained in `files_set`

At the end of the previous iteration, we know the following states:
- `temp_counter` has been incremented (now `temp_counter + 1`).
- `files_set` includes `str(temp_counter)`.
- We also see that `i` is now `i + 1` and it is less than `len(regulars)`.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time:
1. After the last iteration, `temp_counter` is now `temp_counter + 1`. Therefore, `temp_counter` must currently be adjusted to not exceed `2 * n`. If `temp_counter` was at its maximum allowable value of `2 * n`, for the loop to continue, we can infer that `temp_counter` must actually be less than `2 * n`.
2. The string representation `str(temp_counter)` needs to still be present in `files_set` for the loop to continue.

Thus, we need to make these adjustments:
- `temp_counter` should be less than or equal to `2 * n` for the loop to continue. If it was previously equal to `2 * n`, we need it to be adjusted to be less than that or allow for it to potentially stay equal in the case of an exact fit.
- `files_set` must include `str(temp_counter + 1)` for the next iteration.

Considering these points, the adjustments required are to ensure that `temp_counter` is still less than or equal to `2 * n` and `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be included in the `files_set`.

State: **`temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`, `str(temp_counter + 1)` must be in `files_set`**
