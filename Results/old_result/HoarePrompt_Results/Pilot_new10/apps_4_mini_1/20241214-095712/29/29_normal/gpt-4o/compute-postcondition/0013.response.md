Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is a list of n tuples containing filenames and types, if `type_` is '1', then `name` is None, `type_` is None, and `examples` now includes `None`. Otherwise, `name` is not defined due to an error, `type_` cannot be assigned, and `regulars` remains unchanged.***
