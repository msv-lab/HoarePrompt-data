To determine the state for the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop and the given states at the end of the previous iteration. 

The given code indicates a for loop that enumerates over `regular`, starting from `len(examples) + 1`. 

1. The variable `i`, which is the loop's index, is initialized to `len(examples) + 1`. Since `examples` has at least 1 element, `len(examples)` is at least 1, making `i` start from at least 2.
2. The loop processes files from the `regular` list. The key here is to note that `regular` should have more items for the loop to iterate again.

At the end of the last iteration:
- `n` is between 1 and 100000.
- `files` is sorted in descending order.
- `examples` has at least 1 element (implying `len(examples) ≥ 1`).
- `script` has the updated entry in the format mentioned.

To proceed to the next iteration:
- `i` should be incremented by 1.
- For the loop to execute again, `regular` must provide another tuple, meaning it must have at least `len(examples) + 2` entries for the next iteration.

Thus, the updated states at the start of the next iteration should reflect these adjustments:

State: **`n` is an integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000), `files` is sorted in descending order based on the second element of each tuple, `examples` must have at least 1 element, `script` has an updated entry appended with format 'move {file} {i}', where `i` is at least 3 and `regular` must have at least `len(examples) + 2` entries**
