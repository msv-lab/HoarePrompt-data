The code initializes the variable `examples` as an empty list. Since this does not depend on or alter any of the previous state variables (`n` or `files`), they remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100000) representing the number of files with tests; `files` is a list of n tuples containing filenames and types; `examples` is an empty list.**
