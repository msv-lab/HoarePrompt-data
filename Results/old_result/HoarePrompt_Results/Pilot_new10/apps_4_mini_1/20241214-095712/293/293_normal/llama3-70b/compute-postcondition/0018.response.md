The variable `n` is reassigned to `n // 2`. The initial state indicates that `n` is greater than 2, therefore after the operation `n //= 2`, the new value of `n` would be at least 1 (since the smallest integer greater than 2 divided by 2 equals 1). The value of `ans` remains unchanged because the code snippet provided does not directly modify `ans`. The states of the other affected variables remain valid. 

Output State: **`h` is equal to `input_h`, `n` is greater than 1, and `ans` remains unchanged.**
