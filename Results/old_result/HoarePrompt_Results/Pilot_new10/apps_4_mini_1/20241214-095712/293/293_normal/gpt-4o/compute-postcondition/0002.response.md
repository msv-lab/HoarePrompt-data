The value of `total_leaves` is assigned the value of `2 ** h`, which calculates the total number of leaves based on the integer value `h`. Since `h` must be between 1 and 50, `total_leaves` is determined as a power of 2 corresponding to the value of `h`. The value of `n` remains unchanged because it is not affected by the assignment.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `total_leaves` is equal to `2 ** h`.**
