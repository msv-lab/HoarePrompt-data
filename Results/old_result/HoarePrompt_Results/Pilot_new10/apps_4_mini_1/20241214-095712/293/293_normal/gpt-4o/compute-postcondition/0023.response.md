Postcondition: ***`h` is 2, `n` is 2, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 5, `current_level` is an integer, and `path` is a binary string of length `h`. If `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is calculated as `2 * current_level + 1`. Otherwise, `current_node` is updated to `2 * current_node + 2`.***
