Postcondition: ***`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, `total_leaves` is 2, `visited_count` is 1, `path` is a binary string of length `h`, `current_level` is 0, if `direction` is '0', then `current_node` is updated to 1. Otherwise, if `direction` is not '0', then `current_node` is updated to 2.***
