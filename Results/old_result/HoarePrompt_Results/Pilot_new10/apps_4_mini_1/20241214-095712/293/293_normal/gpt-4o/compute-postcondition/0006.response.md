The variable `current_node` is assigned the value `0`. This does not affect the other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged conditions along with the updated value of `current_node`.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`; `total_leaves` is equal to `2`; `visited_count` is 0; `path` is a binary string based on `n - 1` zero-padded to length `h`; `current_level` is 0; `current_node` is 0**.
