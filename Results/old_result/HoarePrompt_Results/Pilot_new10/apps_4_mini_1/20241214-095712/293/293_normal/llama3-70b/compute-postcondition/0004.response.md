The expression `ans += n // 2 - 1` modifies the variable `ans`. Given that `n` is an even number, `n // 2` is defined and results in an integer value. The previous value of `ans` is 0, so we need to calculate the new value of `ans`. 

Let's denote:
- `n` as an even integer value.
- After executing the code, `ans` will be updated to `0 + (n // 2 - 1)`.

Since `n` is greater than 1 and even, `n // 2` is at least 1. Consequently, `ans` will be at least 0. Simplifying further, if we let `k = n // 2`, where `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `ans` will then be `k - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State will include the updated value of `ans` and maintain the other variable states unchanged: 

Output State: **`h` is input_h, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is a positive integer equal to `(n // 2) - 1`, and the current value of `n` is an even number.**
