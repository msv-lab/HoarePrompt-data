The variables `h` and `n` are assigned values from the input, which consists of two integers separated by space in a single line. The method `input().split()` reads the input string and splits it into a list of substrings, which are then mapped to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `h` and `n` have been assigned new integer values based on the input.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `h` ≤ 50; `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2^`h`, with new values assigned from the input.**
