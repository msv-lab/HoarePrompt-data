`ans` is assigned the value of `ans + n // 2`. The value of `n` is an odd number and must be greater than 1, so `n // 2` will result in an integer division that is one less than half of `n`. Therefore, `ans` will be updated from 0 to `n // 2`. The states of the other variables (`h` and `n`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`h` is input_h, `n` must be greater than 1 and is an odd number, `ans` is a value equal to `n // 2`.**
