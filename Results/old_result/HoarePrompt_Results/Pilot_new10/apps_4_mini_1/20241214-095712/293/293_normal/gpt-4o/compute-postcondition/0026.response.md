The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters directly, as it has no input parameters listed in the function definition. Instead, it utilizes inputs defined by the constraints for `h` and `n` through the surrounding context or pre-set variables. 

Since `h` and `n` are defined to be integers with the constraints: `1 ≤ h ≤ 50` and `1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h`, the function likely operates on these values. However, without specific output conditions provided, we do not have information about the output or return values based on the inputs.

To summarize the information we have:

- The function `func_1` accepts no parameters outright, but works with the integers `h` and `n` which are defined by external constraints. 
- `h` is an integer within the range of 1 to 50.
- `n` is an integer within the range of 1 to \(2^h\).

As we do not have additional information about what the outcome of the function is based on these parameters, we are unable to specify the functionality beyond this context.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on the integers h (1 ≤ h ≤ 50) and n (1 ≤ n ≤ 2^h).**
