The statement `ans += n // 2` increments `ans` by the integer division of `n` by 2. Since it is given that `n` must be greater than 2, the value of `n // 2` will be at least 1. The previous value of `ans` is not known, so we will simply express the new value of `ans` as the old value plus an integer value, at least 1.

Output State: **`h` is equal to `input_h`, `n` must be greater than 2, `ans` is increased by `n // 2`**
