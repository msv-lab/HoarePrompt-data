The function accepts two integers `h` and `n` from input, processes them in a loop to calculate a sum `ans` based on the values of `n` as it is halved. Specifically, for every even `n`, it adds `n // 2 - 1` to `ans`, and for odd `n`, it adds `n // 2`. The process continues until `n` becomes 1, at which point the loop exits and `ans` is printed. If `n` begins as 1, the loop does not execute, leaving `ans` at 0. The function does not return any values, only printing the final result.
