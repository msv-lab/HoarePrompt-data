The variable `valid` is assigned the value `False`, which changes its previous state from `True` to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `valid` while retaining the conditions of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `position` is 0, `valid` is False, `t` is 1, `dir` is an input value of 2, `dir` is not equal to 'South', and `dir` is either 'West' or 'East'. The current value of `position` is either 0 or 20000.**
