The `exit()` function terminates the program execution immediately. No changes are made to the variables other than the fact that the program has terminated. The state of all variables remains as they were before the execution of `exit()`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer from user input; `dir` is a value from user input; `curr_lat` is equal to -90; the program has terminated.**
