Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50. If `dir` is 'North', then `curr_lat` has been updated to 90 + (t / 111.195). If `dir` is 'South', then `curr_lat` has been updated to 90 - (t / 111.195). If `dir` is neither 'South' nor 'North', then `curr_lat` remains 90. The value of `curr_lat` is now either less than -90 or greater than 90.***
