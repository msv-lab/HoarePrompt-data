The code `position -= t` decreases the value of `position` by `t`. Given that `t` is 1, the new value of `position` will be `position - 1`. Since the initial value of `position` is 0, after executing this code, `position` will become -1.

The other variables (`n`, `valid`, `dir`) remain unchanged in this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `position` is -1, `valid` is False, `t` is 1, `dir` is an input value 2, and the current value of `dir` is 'North'.**
