The code `exit()` causes the program to terminate immediately. It does not modify any of the variables or their values, but it results in the program stopping execution entirely. Thus, we note that 'NO' was printed prior to this point, which does not affect the variables either.

The values of `n`, `t`, `dir`, and `curr_lat` remain unchanged, and the program effectively ends without modifying their states.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer from user input; `dir` is a value from user input; `curr_lat` is unchanged; initial conditions remain valid; 'NO' is printed; program execution has terminated.**
