You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: In this problem we assume the Earth to be a completely round ball and its surface a perfect sphere. The length of the equator and any meridian is considered to be exactly 40 000 kilometers. Thus, travelling from North Pole to South Pole or vice versa takes exactly 20 000 kilometers.

Limak, a polar bear, lives on the North Pole. Close to the New Year, he helps somebody with delivering packages all around the world. Instead of coordinates of places to visit, Limak got a description how he should move, assuming that he starts from the North Pole. The description consists of n parts. In the i-th part of his journey, Limak should move t_{i} kilometers in the direction represented by a string dir_{i} that is one of: "North", "South", "West", "East".

Limak isn’t sure whether the description is valid. You must help him to check the following conditions:  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the North Pole, he can move only to the South.  If at any moment of time (before any of the instructions or while performing one of them) Limak is on the South Pole, he can move only to the North.  The journey must end on the North Pole. 

Check if the above conditions are satisfied and print "YES" or "NO" on a single line.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50).

The i-th of next n lines contains an integer t_{i} and a string dir_{i} (1 ≤ t_{i} ≤ 10^6, $\operatorname{dir}_{i} \in \{\text{North, South, West, East} \}$) — the length and the direction of the i-th part of the journey, according to the description Limak got.


-----Output-----

Print "YES" if the description satisfies the three conditions, otherwise print "NO", both without the quotes.

Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        (t, dir) = input().split()
        t = int(t)
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
    if position != 0:
        valid = False
    if valid:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic and conditions implemented in the code. 

### Problem Summary:
Limak starts at the North Pole and can only move to the South while at the North Pole. He can move to the North when at the South Pole. The journey must end at the North Pole. Any movement in the wrong direction when at the poles should invalidate the journey, as well as overshooting the maximum travel range between the poles.

### Key Conditions to Consider:
1. When at the North Pole (`position == 0`), Limak can only move South.
2. When at the South Pole (`position == 20000`), Limak can only move North.
3. The final position after all movements must be back at the North Pole (`position == 0`).
4. Movements should not cause Limak to overshoot the range, e.g., moving South should not exceed 20,000 km and moving North should not go below 0 km.

### Analyzing the Program:
1. The variable `position` is initialized to 0, representing Limak's start at the North Pole.
2. The loop processes each instruction:
   - For moving North, the code checks if the new position would drop below 0 (which is correct).
   - For moving South, it checks if the new position exceeds 20,000 km (which is also correct).
   - For movements in the West or East, if Limak is at either pole, `valid` is set to false.
   - If `position` ever goes below 0 or above 20,000, `valid` is flagged as false.
3. After processing all movements, it checks if the final `position` is back at 0 (North Pole).

### Potential Issues:
- The program correctly checks various cases, however, one potential edge case not handled explicitly in the logic:
  - If a journey starts with "North" movement when at the North Pole, the position would go below zero immediately, and it would set `valid` to false.
  - Another critical case that should be explicitly considered is not just if movements are attempted from the poles but also chaining, such as being unable to return to the North Pole after some movements or invalid movement sequences. 
- There’s no explicit check for any direction other than North/South at the poles, but logically, the flow should work. 

However, there is an oversight in logical processing when it comes to evaluating direct edge cases. For example, if input directs to go North initially from 0 or South from 20000 will cause the validation loop to break quickly without proper management of movement states.

### Example Input to Show Failure:
Suppose we start the journey with:
```
1
1000 North
```
This journey is invalid because Limak cannot move North when at the North Pole, and the current implementation would allow that as it would reduce the position incorrectly, failing to check if the movement is possible at that moment.

### Conclusion:
Given the logic breakdown and potential edge cases laid out, we conclude that we can find a case where the program does not work as expected.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), and for each part of the journey, t_i is a positive integer (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6) representing the distance, and dir_i is a string that is either "North", "South", "West", or "East".
def func():
    n = int(input())
    position = 0
    valid = True
    for _ in range(n):
        t, dir = input().split()
        
        t = int(t)
        
        if dir == 'North':
            if position - t < 0:
                valid = False
            position -= t
        elif dir == 'South':
            if position + t > 20000:
                valid = False
            position += t
        elif dir in ('West', 'East'):
            if position == 0 or position == 20000:
                valid = False
        
        if position < 0 or position > 20000:
            valid = False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `position` is within the range [0, 20000], `valid` is dependent on whether all moves were valid during iterations, and `t` remains an integer input value from the iterations.
    if (position != 0) :
        valid = False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and `position` is within the range [0, 20000]. If `position` is not equal to 0, then `valid` is False and `t` remains an integer input value from the iterations.
    if valid :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 50), `position` is within the range [0, 20000]. If `valid` is True and `position` is not equal to 0, then the output is 'YES'; if `valid` is False, then 'NO' is printed regardless of the state of `position`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
