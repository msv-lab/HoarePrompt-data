Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; if `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, the execution terminates and `curr_lat` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `curr_lat` may be updated based on the value of `dir`, which could be 'North', 'South', or neither, with the corresponding adjustments to `curr_lat`.***
