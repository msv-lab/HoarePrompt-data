The code modifies the value of `curr_lat` by subtracting `t / 111.195` from it. The variable `curr_lat` is updated, while `n`, `t`, `dir`, and the unchanged status of `curr_lat` remain valid. The output state specifies the update to `curr_lat`, where the change is based on the value of `t`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a value from user input, `curr_lat` is updated to `curr_lat - t / 111.195**
