The code `exit()` terminates the program immediately and does not change the values of any variables. Thus, the states of all variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `curr_lat` remains unchanged; `dir` remains unchanged and the program exits.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `curr_lat` remains unchanged; `dir` remains unchanged and the program exits.**
