Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer. If `curr_lat` is equal to 90 and `dir` is not 'South', 'NO' is printed and the program execution is terminated. If `curr_lat` is equal to -90 and `dir` is not 'North', then `curr_lat` remains unchanged and `dir` remains unchanged, and the program exits. If `curr_lat` is outside the boundaries of -90 to 90, the execution terminates and `curr_lat` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `curr_lat` may be updated based on the value of `dir` as previously defined, and 'NO' is printed while the program execution ends.***
