The variable `valid` is explicitly assigned the value `False`. Since it already holds the value `False` in the initial state, there are no changes made to this variable. The other variables (`n`, `t`, and `dir`) remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `valid` is False, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input string.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `valid` is False, `t` is an input integer, `dir` is an input string.**
