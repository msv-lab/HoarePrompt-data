According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined to be an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, we know that the loop will execute for `n` iterations. The variable `_` is used as a throwaway variable, indicating that the actual value of the loop variable is not utilized in the loop body, but it still iterates `n` times.

Before the loop starts, `curr_lat` is given as 90. This value does not influence whether the loop executes; it only indicates a state that might be used later in the program but doesn't affect loop execution itself.

For the loop to be executed, the parameters are already in the correct range, and the value of `_` will start at 0 and increase by 1 for each iteration of the loop. Thus, we don't need to specify `_` since we only need to establish that the loop is executing based on the conditions defined for `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90**
