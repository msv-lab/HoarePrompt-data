Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle the movement in both "West" and "East" directions correctly, as it completely ignores those moves by doing nothing when encountering them. Therefore, it does not meet the requirement of ensuring that Limak stays within the latitude constraints if any east-west movements are part of the journey.

For example, consider the scenario:
```
Input
3
10000 South
10000 East
10000 North
```
In this case, Limak begins at the North Pole (90 degrees latitude), moves South to 80 degrees, then makes an East move, which the code ignores, and finally moves North back to 90 degrees. The final output would be "YES", even though Limak has made an invalid move that wasn't properly accounted for, as he could not have realistically made a valid eastward adjustment without changing his latitude. 

Hence, the program doesn't satisfy the problem's conditions for every potential case, leading to an incorrect correctness assessment.
