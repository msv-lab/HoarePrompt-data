Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer from user input; `dir` is a value from user input; if `curr_lat` is equal to 90 and `dir` is not 'South', the program has terminated, indicating that the precondition of `curr_lat` being -90 has been met and 'NO' was printed. If `curr_lat` is not equal to 90, the program does not change `curr_lat` and continues execution based on its defined behavior.***
