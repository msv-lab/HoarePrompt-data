The code contains a `continue` statement, which itself does not change any variable's value but affects the control flow of loops by skipping the current iteration and proceeding to the next. Since there are no loops mentioned in the initial state, we assume it is not currently within a loop context.

Thus, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but we acknowledge that the execution will skip to the next iteration of a loop if there is one. As no specific state about the loop is given, I will leave the internal context of the loop unaddressed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a value from user input, `curr_lat` remains unchanged, and we proceed to the next iteration of the loop (if in a loop context).**
