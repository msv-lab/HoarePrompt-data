The code executes a `print` statement that outputs the string 'NO'. The variables in the initial state (`n`, `t`, `curr_lat`, `dir`) are not modified by this operation. As such, `curr_lat`, `n`, and `t` retain their previous values, while the `print` statement simply outputs the specified text.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `t` is an integer; `curr_lat` remains unchanged; `dir` remains unchanged.**
