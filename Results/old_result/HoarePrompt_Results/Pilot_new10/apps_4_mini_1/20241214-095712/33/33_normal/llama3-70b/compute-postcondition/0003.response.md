In the provided code, `t` and `dir` are assigned the values obtained from the input, which are split. The initial state shows that `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 50 and `curr_lat` is 90. The impact of the code is that `t` and `dir` will now hold the values given through input but their specific values are unknown since they depend on user input. The variables `n` and `curr_lat` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90, `t` is an input value, `dir` is an input value**
