Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and `valid` remains False. If `dir` is 'South', then if `position + t` exceeds 20000, `position` remains unchanged; otherwise, `position` is updated to `position + t`. If `dir` is either 'West' or 'East', the program state remains unchanged if `position` is 0 or 20000; otherwise, the state remains unchanged as well.***
