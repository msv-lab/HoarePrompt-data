Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50; `dir` can be either 'North', 'South', or neither; if `curr_lat` is less than -90 or greater than 90, 'NO' is printed and the program exits. If `curr_lat` is within the valid latitude range, the program continues to the next iteration of the nearest loop without printing 'NO'.***
