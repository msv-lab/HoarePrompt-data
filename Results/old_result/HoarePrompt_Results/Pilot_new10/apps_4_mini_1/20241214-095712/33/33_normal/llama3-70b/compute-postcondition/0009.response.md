`curr_lat` is decremented by `t / 111.195`, which indicates a change in the current latitude based on the integer value of `t`. The range of `n` is not directly affected by this code. The value of `curr_lat` will be calculated as `90 - (t / 111.195)`. The values of `dir` and `n` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90 - (t / 111.195), `t` is an integer, `dir` is not equal to 'North', the current value of `dir` is 'South'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 50, `curr_lat` is 90 - (t / 111.195), `t` is an integer, `dir` is not equal to 'North', the current value of `dir` is 'South'**.
