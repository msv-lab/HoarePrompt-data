Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer; if `position` is either negative or greater than 20000, then `dir` is an input value of 2, `position` is either 0 or 20000, `valid` is set to False, and `t` remains 1. Otherwise, `position` is within the range of 0 to 20000, and all other variable states remain unchanged.***
