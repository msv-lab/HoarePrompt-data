Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) that indicates the number of movements, and for each movement, it takes a positive integer `t` representing the distance and a direction `dir` which can be "North", "South", "West", or "East". The function checks whether each movement keeps the position within the valid range of 0 to 20000. It determines if the series of movements results in the final position being exactly 0, and returns 'YES' if all movements are valid and the final position is 0, or 'NO' otherwise. Additionally, the function considers invalid movements such as moving North beyond the starting point or moving South beyond 20000, and invalid directional movements when at the boundaries.**
