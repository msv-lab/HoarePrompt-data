The function `func` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer satisfying the constraint 1 ≤ n ≤ 50. For each of the next `n` lines, the function expects a pair of values: `t_i`, which is an integer with the constraint 1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6, and `dir_i`, which is a string that can be either "North", "South", "West", or "East". 

The output of the function is a result determined by these inputs, though no specific output behavior is detailed in the initial information provided.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 50) and for each of the following n lines, expects an integer t_i (1 ≤ t_i ≤ 10^6) and a direction dir_i ("North", "South", "West", "East"). The specific output based on these inputs is not described.**
