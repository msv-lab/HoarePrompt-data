Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the number of years needed for Limak's weight (which triples each year) to exceed Bob's weight (which doubles each year). The loop continues until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight, and the correct number of years is printed.

Here’s a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing Limak's and Bob's weights, respectively.
2. **Weight Growth**: In each iteration of the `while` loop, it updates Limak's weight by tripling it (`a *= 3`) and Bob's weight by doubling it (`b *= 2`), which follows the problem description.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight (`while a <= b:`), ensuring it stops once Limak's weight is strictly greater.
4. **Counting Years**: The variable `years` is incremented correctly to keep track of the number of years until the condition is met. 

Since the logic covers all the specified edge cases in the problem (e.g., Limak starting with the same weight as Bob), and given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), it will successfully determine the correct number of years needed in all possible scenarios.
