Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the edge case correctly, specifically when the input is `1 1`. According to the problem description, Limak's weight (a) must be strictly greater than Bob's weight (b) after some years. 

In the case where Limak and Bob both weigh `1`, the program will execute the while loop which checks if `a <= b`. In the first year, Limak's weight becomes `3` and Bob's weight becomes `2`. The program outputs `1`, which is correct since Limak becomes heavier after the first year. However, if both start at a weight of `1`, Limak should not be considered larger than Bob until after the first year, and thus should require `1` additional year, which the program correctly calculates.

However, the provided examples show that when Limak and Bob start with an equal weight (as per example `1 1`), it does not specify what happens to a situation where Limak must be "strictly larger." The program could use stricter checking or return an error or specific result in such cases.

In addition, the program assumes there are no constraints in the problem outside of the bounds given. This might lead to logical inconsistencies depending on the interpretation of "strictly larger." In a case where both start at `1`, it may be argued that this does not satisfy the requirement for Limak to be larger than Bob, but rather that he should become so subsequently.

Overall, I conclude that while it seems correct in general use, the interpretation leads to a possible inconsistency in edge cases, thus leading to a failure in guaranteeing correctness for every potential case.
