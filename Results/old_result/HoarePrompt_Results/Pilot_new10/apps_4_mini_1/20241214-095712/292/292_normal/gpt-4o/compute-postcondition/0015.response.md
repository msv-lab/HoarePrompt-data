The `print(years)` statement outputs the value of the variable `years`. The state of `years` before execution is at least 3, but it does not change after the print statement is executed. The values of `a` and `b` also remain unchanged. As a result, the output reflects the current value of `years` as well as the constraints on `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is at least 27, `b` is at most less than `a`, `years` is at least 3 and printed out**.
