The value of `b` is doubled. The previous value of `b` was an integer such that `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`. This means that `b` was between `a` and `10`. After executing the code, `b` will now be in the range `[2, 20]` because it is multiplied by `2`. The states of the other variables, `a` and `years`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a value in the range [3, 30]; `b` is an integer in the range [2, 20]; `years` is 0**.
