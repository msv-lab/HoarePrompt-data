Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the number of years required for Limak's weight (a) to exceed Bob's weight (b) given that Limak's weight triples and Bob's weight doubles each year. The program initializes a counter for the years and enters a while loop, continuing until Limak's weight surpasses Bob's. Each iteration of the loop appropriately updates their weights and increments the year counter.

The examples used in the output hints are consistent with the program's behavior:

1. For the input 4 and 7, the program correctly calculates that Limak becomes larger than Bob after 2 years.
2. For the input 4 and 9, it correctly finds that Limak outweighs Bob after 3 years.
3. For the input 1 and 1, the program outputs 1 year, which is also correct since Limak triples his weight and surpasses Bob's weight in one year.

Since the program handles all edge cases outlined, including the lower limit of the input range (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) and the stipulation that Limak's initial weight is not greater than Bob's, the implementation is validated to work properly across all valid input scenarios.

Therefore, I conclude that the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
