In the initial state, `a` is equal to `3 * a` (with the condition that it must remain less than or equal to 40), `b` is a value between 4 and 40, and `years` is 2. 

After executing the code `b *= 2`, the value of `b` is doubled. Since `b` is originally between 4 and 40, the possible range for `b` after the operation becomes between 8 and 80. However, it is important to note that if `b` starts at 20 or greater, it will exceed 40 after doubling, which would violate the initial condition. Therefore, we must conclude that `b` must have been originally between 4 and 20 to satisfy both conditions: after doubling it must still be â‰¤ 40.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, we do not have specific numerical values for `a` or `years`, only their descriptions.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `3 * a` (which is less than or equal to 40), `b` is between 8 and 40 (original `b` was between 4 and 20), `years` is 2**.
