To verify the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether it accurately computes the number of years after which Limak’s weight becomes strictly greater than Bob’s weight.

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads two integers, `a` (Limak's weight) and `b` (Bob's weight), which ensures correct bounds (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10).

2. **Weight Update Logic**: 
   - Inside a `while` loop, the program continuously triples Limak’s weight (`a *= 3`) and doubles Bob’s weight (`b *= 2`). This is in line with the problem statement, as Limak's weight increases three times every year while Bob's doubles.

3. **Loop Condition**:
   - The loop continues as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`). This condition guarantees that the loop will run until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight, which is exactly what needs to happen according to the problem requirements.

4. **Year Counting**:
   - A `years` variable is incremented with each iteration of the loop, counting how many years it takes for Limak to surpass Bob in weight.

5. **Output**:
   - The program correctly outputs the number of years using `print(years)`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Minimum Input**: For the minimum values (1, 1), after one year, Limak's weight becomes `3` while Bob's weight becomes `2`. The output should be `1`, which is correctly handled.
- **Upper Bound Cases**: Consider cases like (4, 4) or (9, 10), where the weights start equal or very close. The program ensures Limak will eventually exceed Bob due to the respective growth rates.

### Conclusion:
The program successfully meets all requirements outlined in the problem description: it calculates how many years it will take for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob, using the correct growth rates and conditions. There are no cases in which the program would produce an incorrect result based on the stated problem constraints.

Therefore, the final correctness assessment is:

Correctness: **True**
