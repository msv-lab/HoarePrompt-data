You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 7

Output
2

Input
4 9

Output
3

Input
1 1

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Limak weighs 4 and Bob weighs 7 initially. After one year their weights are 4·3 = 12 and 7·2 = 14 respectively (one weight is tripled while the other one is doubled). Limak isn't larger than Bob yet. After the second year weights are 36 and 28, so the first weight is greater than the second one. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print 2.

In the second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are: 12 and 18, then 36 and 36, and finally 108 and 72 (after three years). The answer is 3. Remember that Limak wants to be larger than Bob and he won't be satisfied with equal weights.

In the third sample, Limak becomes larger than Bob after the first year. Their weights will be 3 and 2 then.
Program:
```
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        b *= 2
        years += 1
    print(years)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It calculates the number of years needed for Limak's weight (which triples each year) to exceed Bob's weight (which doubles each year). The loop continues until Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight, and the correct number of years is printed.

Here’s a breakdown of the program's correctness:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing Limak's and Bob's weights, respectively.
2. **Weight Growth**: In each iteration of the `while` loop, it updates Limak's weight by tripling it (`a *= 3`) and Bob's weight by doubling it (`b *= 2`), which follows the problem description.
3. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight (`while a <= b:`), ensuring it stops once Limak's weight is strictly greater.
4. **Counting Years**: The variable `years` is incremented correctly to keep track of the number of years until the condition is met. 

Since the logic covers all the specified edge cases in the problem (e.g., Limak starting with the same weight as Bob), and given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), it will successfully determine the correct number of years needed in all possible scenarios.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, representing the weights of Limak and Bob respectively, with Limak's weight being less than or equal to Bob's weight.
def func():
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        
        b *= 2
        
        years += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is greater than `b`, `years` is 3, `b` is between 8 and 80, `a` is between 27 and 270.
    print(years)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
