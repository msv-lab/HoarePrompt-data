According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. The loop can execute again if `a` is less than or equal to `b`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `a` is between 9 and 60
- `b` is between 4 and 40

For the loop to execute at least one more time, `a` must be less than or equal to `b`. However, since `b` can be at most 40 and `a` is at least 9, we cannot guarantee that `a` is less than or equal to `b` without additional information.

To ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state. Specifically, `a` must be less than or equal to 40 since `b` can be at most 40.

State: **`a` must be less than or equal to 40, `b` is between 4 and 40, `years` is 2**
