Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It reads two integers `a` and `b`, representing Limak's weight and Bob's weight respectively. The program enters a loop that continues until Limak's weight `a` is greater than Bob's weight `b`, tripling Limak's weight and doubling Bob's weight in each iteration while keeping track of the number of years passed.

The examples in the problem description are well-handled by the code:

1. For the input `(4, 7)`, Limak's weight becomes `12` and Bob's weight `14` after the first year, and then Limak becomes `36` while Bob becomes `28` after the second year, so the output is `2`, which is correct.
2. For the input `(4, 9)`, Limak's weight goes from `4` to `12` (first year), `36` (third year) while Bob's weight goes from `9` to `18`, `36`, and finally `72`, resulting in Limak's weight being greater than Bob's after 3 years, thus the output is `3`, which is also correct.
3. For the input `(1, 1)`, after one year Limak will be `3` and Bob will be `2`, which is also captured correctly with output `1`.

Since the program successfully handles all specified edge cases and follows the problem requirements correctly, the conclusion is that the program is indeed correct in its implementation.
