Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It simulates the growth of Limak's and Bob's weights over time, adhering to the specified rules of weight increase (Limak's weight tripling and Bob's weight doubling) until Limak's weight surpasses Bob's weight.

Here's how the program works and why it's correct:

1. **Input Handling**: It reads two integers, `a` and `b`, which represent the initial weights of Limak and Bob, respectively. The program assumes `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`, which means the inputs will always be valid based on the problem's constraints.

2. **Weight Growth Calculation**: 
   - It initializes `years` to `0`, which will count how many years it takes for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob.
   - Inside a `while` loop, it continues to execute as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`).
   - During each iteration:
     - Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`)
     - Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`)
     - The year count is incremented by `1`.

3. **Loop Termination**: The loop automatically stops when Limak's weight becomes strictly greater than Bob's weight. At that point, the total number of years taken for Limak to surpass Bob is printed.

4. **Output**: The program's output matches the expected output from the problem description, demonstrating that it adheres precisely to the requirement of computing the number of years needed for Limak to become heavier than Bob.

Overall, the logic follows the rules set out in the problem description, ensuring that the program will always produce the correct result for any valid input within the specified range. Thus, the program is correct and meets the problem requirements entirely.
