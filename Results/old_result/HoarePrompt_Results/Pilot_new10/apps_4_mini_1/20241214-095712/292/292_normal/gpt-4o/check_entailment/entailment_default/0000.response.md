Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the logic required to determine the number of years it will take for Limak to weigh more than Bob. It starts with the initial weights `a` and `b`, and in each iteration of the while loop, it correctly updates Limak's weight to be triple its previous value and Bob's weight to be double its previous value. The loop continues until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. 

For every allowed input case (where 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program accurately calculates the years needed for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob. The function handles the edge cases outlined in the problem description, including the scenario where their weights start equal (1, 1), where Limak surpasses Bob in just one year, and all higher weights up to the maximum constraints. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case as outlined in the problem description.
