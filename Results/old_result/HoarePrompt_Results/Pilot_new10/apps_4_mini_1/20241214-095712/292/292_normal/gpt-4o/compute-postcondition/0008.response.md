The value of `b` is multiplied by 2. The initial condition states that `b` must be at least 3, so after the operation, `b` will be at least 6. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is in the range [9, 90]; `b` is at least 6; `years` is 1.

Output State: **`a` is in the range [9, 90]; `b` is at least 6; `years` is 1**
