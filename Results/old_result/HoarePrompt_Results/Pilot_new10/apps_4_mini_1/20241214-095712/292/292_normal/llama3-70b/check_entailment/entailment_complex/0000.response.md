The provided program aims to solve the problem of determining after how many full years Limak's weight will exceed Bob's weight, given that Limak's weight triples and Bob's weight doubles every year.

**Correctness: True**

### Explanation of Correctness:
1. **Input Constraints**: The program reads two integers `a` and `b`, ensuring that they satisfy the condition `1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10`. This adheres to the problem constraints.

2. **Logic**: The program initializes a variable `years` to track the number of years. It then enters a while loop that continues as long as Limak's weight (`a`) is less than or equal to Bob's weight (`b`):
   - Each iteration of the loop triples Limak's weight (`a *= 3`) and doubles Bob's weight (`b *= 2`).
   - The counter for years (`years`) is incremented in each iteration.

3. **Termination**: The loop is guaranteed to terminate because, in each iteration, Limak's weight increases faster than Bob's weight. Specifically, every year, Limak's weight grows by a factor of 3, while Bob's grows by a factor of 2. Therefore, after a finite number of iterations (years), Limak's weight will exceed Bob's.

4. **Output**: After exiting the loop, the program prints the number of years calculated, which directly aligns with the problem's requirements.

5. **Special Cases**: 
   - For inputs like (1, 1), the calculation of weights after the first year gives: Limak's weight becomes 3 and Bob's weight becomes 2, fulfilling the requirement that his weight becomes strictly greater.
   - Similarly, for inputs like (4, 7) and (4, 9), the calculations process through multiple years correctly computes the number of years needed for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, calculates correctly for all valid inputs, and prints the expected output. Thus, it meets all the requirements, ensuring that it always conforms to the problem description.
