You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 7

Output
2

Input
4 9

Output
3

Input
1 1

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Limak weighs 4 and Bob weighs 7 initially. After one year their weights are 4·3 = 12 and 7·2 = 14 respectively (one weight is tripled while the other one is doubled). Limak isn't larger than Bob yet. After the second year weights are 36 and 28, so the first weight is greater than the second one. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print 2.

In the second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are: 12 and 18, then 36 and 36, and finally 108 and 72 (after three years). The answer is 3. Remember that Limak wants to be larger than Bob and he won't be satisfied with equal weights.

In the third sample, Limak becomes larger than Bob after the first year. Their weights will be 3 and 2 then.
Program:
```
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        b *= 2
        years += 1
    print(years)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze both the requirements and the implementation.

### Requirements Recap:
1. Limak's weight `a` is less than or equal to Bob's weight `b`.
2. Limak's weight triples every year, while Bob's weight doubles.
3. We need to determine how many full years it will take for Limak to become strictly heavier than Bob.

### Code Analysis:
The provided code essentially reads the weights of Limak and Bob and simulates their weight growth over the years using a while loop until Limak's weight is greater than Bob's:

```python
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        b *= 2
        years += 1
    print(years)
```

#### Key Points of Code:
- The code starts by reading the weights.
- It initializes a `years` counter.
- A while loop runs as long as Limak's weight `a` is less than or equal to Bob's weight `b`:
  - Limak's weight is tripled (`a *= 3`).
  - Bob's weight is doubled (`b *= 2`).
  - The `years` counter is incremented each iteration.

### Testing Edge Cases:
Let’s consider the given edge cases based on the inputs from the problem description:

1. **Input**: `4 7`
   - Year 1: Limak = 12, Bob = 14  (Not larger)
   - Year 2: Limak = 36, Bob = 28 (Larger)
   - Output: `2` (Correct)

2. **Input**: `4 9`
   - Year 1: Limak = 12, Bob = 18 (Not larger)
   - Year 2: Limak = 36, Bob = 36 (Not larger)
   - Year 3: Limak = 108, Bob = 72 (Larger)
   - Output: `3` (Correct)

3. **Input**: `1 1`
   - Year 1: Limak = 3, Bob = 2 (Larger)
   - Output: `1` (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The implementation correctly handles the cases where Limak needs to become strictly heavier than Bob by appropriately computing both weights based on the given rules. Given the constraints (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10), the program should execute within reasonable bounds without missing any case.

### Verdict:
Since the program works correctly for all tested provided examples, there are no apparent flaws in the logic. 

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10.
def func():
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        
        b *= 2
        
        years += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is at least 27, `b` is at most less than `a`, and `years` is at least 3
    print(years)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` (both between 1 and 10, with `a` ≤ `b`) and calculates the number of years it takes for `a` (tripled each year) to exceed `b` (doubled each year). It prints the total number of years required for this condition to be met.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
