According to the code, the loop iterates over the vertices connected to the vertex `u` in the `graph`. The key variable determining whether the loop can execute again is the number of vertices in `graph[u]`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `u` is a valid key in `graph`, and `graph[u]` must have at least 1 vertex. For the loop to execute one more time, we must take into account that one vertex in `graph[u]` will be processed during this iteration. 

If `graph[u]` has at least 1 vertex at the end of the last iteration, after processing one vertex, there will be 0 vertices left for the loop to continue. Thus, to allow for another complete iteration the `graph[u]` must have at least 2 vertices at the start of the next iteration. Additionally, the loop will typically access the next vertex in the sequence, implying we will refer to that vertex in the next execution of the loop.

State: **`in_degree` of each vertex remains the same, `u` is a valid key in graph, `graph[u]` must have at least 2 vertices, `v` is the next vertex in `graph[u]`.**
