The value of `in_degree[v]` is incremented by 1. The `in_degree` of each vertex remains the same except for `v`, which is increased by 1. Other variables (`u`, `graph`, and `v`) remain unchanged according to the precondition statements.

Output State: **`in_degree` of each vertex remains the same, except `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1, `u` is a valid key in graph, `graph[u]` must have at least 2 vertices, `v` is the next vertex in `graph[u]`.**
