According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `queue`. If `queue` is not empty, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `queue` is described as a deque containing nodes from `in_degree` where `in_degree[node] == 0`. For the loop to execute at least once, `queue` must contain at least one node. 

As such, the state we need to adjust involves ensuring that at least one vertex exists in `in_degree` with an incoming edge count of zero. 

State: **`in_degree` must contain at least one key with value 0, `queue` must not be empty**
