The `count` variable is initialized to 0. This assignment indicates that `count` will hold a numeric value but does not specifically affect any other variables or the content of `in_degree` or `queue`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`in_degree` is a dictionary with all keys representing vertices and their corresponding incoming edge counts, `queue` is a deque containing nodes from `in_degree` where `in_degree[node] == 0, count` is 0**
