Postcondition: ***`node` is the current node and `neighbor` is the next unvisited neighbor in `graph[node]`. If the function `func_1` returns True for `neighbor`, it indicates a successful condition related to the current node and its unvisited neighbor in the graph. Otherwise, there is no return or additional action taken.***
