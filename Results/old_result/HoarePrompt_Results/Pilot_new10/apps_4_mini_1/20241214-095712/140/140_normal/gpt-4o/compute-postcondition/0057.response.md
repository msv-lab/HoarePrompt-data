According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the structure of `graph` as well as the `node`. Since `graph[node]` must have at least one more neighbor for the loop to run one more time and at the end of the last iteration, `graph[node]` has at least one more neighbor available, we know that the loop can execute again for the next neighbor in the list. The `neighbor` will be the next element in `graph[node]` after the current one.

If `graph[node]` had 2 neighbors at the end of the last iteration, the current `neighbor` would represent the first neighbor, and the next iteration would represent the next neighbor in line. Therefore, the state must reflect the next `neighbor` in the `graph[node]`. 

Thus, we need to adjust for the next `neighbor`, but since we are not told the exact number of neighbors and which specific `neighbor` is currently processed, we will just refer to it as the "next neighbor".

State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is an integer, `queue` includes `neighbor` if `in_degree[neighbor]` becomes 0 after being decreased by 1, `count` remains the same, `graph[node]` must have at least one more neighbor, `node` remains unchanged, `neighbor` is the next neighbor in `graph[node]`**
