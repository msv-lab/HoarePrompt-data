Postcondition: ***`in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1 and must be at least -1. The `queue` now has one additional neighbor which is `neighbor`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` has at least 2 neighbors, and `neighbor` is the next neighbor in the list only if `in_degree[neighbor]` is equal to 0.***
