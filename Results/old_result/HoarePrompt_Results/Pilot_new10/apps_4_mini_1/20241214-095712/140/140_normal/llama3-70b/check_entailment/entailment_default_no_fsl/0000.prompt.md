You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Program:
```
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
graph = [[] for _ in range(n + 1)]
for _ in range(m):
    (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
    graph[u].append(v)
visited = [False] * (n + 1)
rec_stack = [False] * (n + 1)
has_cycle = False
for node in range(1, n + 1):
    if not visited[node]:
        if func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
            has_cycle = True
            break
if has_cycle:
    print('NO')
else:
    print('YES')

def func_1(node, graph, visited, rec_stack):
    visited[node] = True
    rec_stack[node] = True
    for neighbor in graph[node]:
        if not visited[neighbor]:
            if func_1(neighbor, graph, visited, rec_stack):
                return True
        elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
            return True
    rec_stack[node] = False
    return False


```
Output hints: The function accepts an integer `node`, a list of tuples `graph` representing directed edges, a set `visited` to track visited nodes, and a set `rec_stack` to monitor nodes currently in the recursion stack. It returns True if a cycle is detected in the directed graph; otherwise, it returns False. The function performs a depth-first search to explore the graph and checks for cycles by determining if a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
