Correctness: **False**

The provided code fails to correctly determine if a directed graph can be made acyclic by removing at most one edge in certain cases. 

One potential failure case can be seen in the following example:

Input:
```
5 5
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 5
5 2
```
In this case, removing the edge `5 -> 2` would still leave a cycle involving nodes `2`, `3`, and `4`. The function would return `NO`, which is incorrect; the output should actually be `YES`, since removing another edge (that also results in the graph being acyclic) is necessary and allowed under the problem description.

The program is designed to check for cycles and remove edges one by one. However, it doesn't cover the scenario where the removal of a single edge may not be sufficient if there are multiple cycles that may need to be broken to make the graph acyclic, leading the logic to incorrectly conclude for certain graphs. 

Therefore, as it does not pass every potential case, the correctness of the program is false.
