The function accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `edges`, where `n` is the number of vertices, `m` is the number of directed edges between these vertices, and `edges` represents the graph's edges. The function checks if the directed graph, represented by these edges, contains a cycle. If there are no cycles, it returns 'YES'. If a cycle is detected, it checks each edge one by one, removing it temporarily to see if the removal makes the graph acyclic. If removing any edge allows the graph to be acyclic, it returns 'YES'. If none of the edges can be removed to eliminate cycles, the function returns 'NO'. The edge cases include handling graphs near the minimum size of vertices and maximum size of edges, and considering that input edges may contain valid or invalid relationships.
