The function accepts an integer `node`, a list of tuples `graph` representing directed edges, a set `visited` to track visited nodes, and a set `rec_stack` to monitor nodes currently in the recursion stack. It returns True if a cycle is detected in the directed graph; otherwise, it returns False. The function performs a depth-first search to explore the graph and checks for cycles by determining if a node is revisited while still in the recursion stack.
