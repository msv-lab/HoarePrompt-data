Output State: **`in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, `queue` now has `queue - 1 + 1` neighbors (due to the append), `count` is now increased by 1, `graph[node]` has at least 1 neighbor, `node` is the element popped from `queue`, `in_degree[neighbor]` is now 0, and `neighbor` has been appended to `queue`.**
