Output State: **`node` is an integer representing the current node, `visited` is a set of integers representing all nodes that have been visited during the traversal, `rec_stack` is a set of integers representing the nodes that are currently in the recursion stack. The `graph` structure indicates if any cycles were detected. If no cycles were detected, the function returns False; if a cycle was detected at any point, it returns True.**
