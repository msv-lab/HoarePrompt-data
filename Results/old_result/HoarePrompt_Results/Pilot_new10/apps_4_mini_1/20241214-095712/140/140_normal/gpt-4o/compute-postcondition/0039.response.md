Postcondition: ***`in_degree[neighbor]` is decreased by 1, `queue` has the previously existing elements plus the newly appended `neighbor`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` continues to have at least one more neighbor. If `in_degree[neighbor]` equals 0, then `neighbor` is processed and added to the queue; otherwise, the function does nothing further regarding `neighbor`.***
