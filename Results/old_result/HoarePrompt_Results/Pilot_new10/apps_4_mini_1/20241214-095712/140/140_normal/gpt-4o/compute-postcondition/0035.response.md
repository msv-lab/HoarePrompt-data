Postcondition: ***`in_degree` must contain at least one key with value greater than or equal to -1. If `in_degree[neighbor]` was 0, `queue` now includes the previously existing elements plus the newly appended `neighbor`, `count` is increased by 1, `graph[node]` continues to have at least one neighbor, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is now -1.***
