Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly determine if it's possible to make the directed graph acyclic by removing at most one edge. 

The issue arises from how the program defines "acyclic" and checks for cycles. The current implementation simply checks if the graph has any cycles. If cycles are present, the program concludes that it's impossible to make the graph acyclic by removing just one edge, outputting "NO." However, there are cases where removing just one edge will indeed resolve a cycle.

For instance, consider the following input:
```
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 2
```
In this case, there is a cycle formed by the edges 2 → 3 → 4 → 2. By removing the edge 4 → 2, the graph becomes acyclic. The correct output should be "YES," but the current implementation would incorrectly output "NO" because it detects a cycle in the initial check.

Therefore, the code fails in this scenario, and as it does not handle all cases correctly, the final verdict on correctness is **False**.
