The value of `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`. The previous value of `i` is `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is less than 100, `i` will be at least 1 and up to 100. Therefore, `min_t` takes on the value of `i`, which is `mid + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_cost` is now equal to `cost`, `min_t` is equal to `i`, `i` is `mid + 1`, `mid` is less than 100, and the current value of `cost` is less than the previous `min_cost`.**
