You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_cost = float('inf')
    best_t = -1
    for t in range(1, 101):
        current_cost = 0
        for length in a:
            if length < t - 1:
                current_cost += t - 1 - length
            elif length > t + 1:
                current_cost += length - (t + 1)
        if current_cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = current_cost
            best_t = t
    print(best_t, min_cost)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's analyze how the program operates:

1. **Understanding Inputs/Outputs:**
   - The program takes the number of sticks `n` and their respective lengths `a_i`.
   - It looks for a positive integer `t` such that the lengths of all sticks can be modified to be "almost good" (i.e., satisfy `|a_i - t| <= 1`) with the minimum total cost.

2. **Logic of the Program:**
   - The program iterates through all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100.
   - For each `t`, it calculates the `current_cost` required to adjust each stick length to make it almost good for that `t`:
     - If `length < t - 1`, it calculates the cost as `t - 1 - length` (the amount to increase it to `t - 1`).
     - If `length > t + 1`, it calculates the cost as `length - (t + 1)` (the amount to decrease it to `t + 1`).
   - If a stick is already within the bounds of `t-1` and `t+1`, no cost is incurred for that stick.
   - The program tracks the `min_cost` and the corresponding `best_t`.

3. **Potential Edge Cases:**
   - A case where all stick lengths are already within `t-1` and `t+1` for the best cost (checked correctly).
   - A case where all stick lengths are the same.
   - A situation where adjusting one stick heavily influences whether it can meet the "almost good" criteria for a chosen `t`.

**Testing the Implementation:**
Let's evaluate a specific case:
- Input:  
  ```
  3
  100 99 98
  ```
- Here, we can choose `t = 99`. The costs would be:
  - For `length = 100`: Cost = 1 (to reduce to 99).
  - For `length = 99`: Cost = 0 (already good).
  - For `length = 98`: Cost = 1 (to increase to 99).
  
Total cost = 1 + 0 + 1 = 2.

This case is well-handled by the program as it would indeed choose `t = 99` resulting in a correct minimal cost.

However, consider this other case:
- Input:  
  ```
  5
  1 1 1 100 100
  ```

Here:
- The ideal `t` would be 2. The costs would be:
  - For each 1: Cost = 1 (to increase to 2).
  - For each 100: Cost = 98 (to reduce to 2).

Following this, the total cost is:
- From 1s: 3 * 1 = 3
- From 100s: 2 * 98 = 196

Resulting in a total cost of `199` for `t = 2`, but that isn't being tested correctly in the iteration (potentially suggesting it yields more than one option, but misses optimality).

Since the implementation inaccurately assesses cost per stick length against the full choice of `t`, it fails to achieve the global minimum cost across all choices. 

Thus, with examples available that illustrate failure in minimal cost detection:

Correctness: **False**  
Reason: The program does not compute or return the minimum cost in every edge scenario, particularly when there are outliers affecting the average.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 1000, and a is a list of n integers where each integer a_i is a positive integer such that 1 <= a_i <= 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_cost = float('inf')
    best_t = -1
    for t in range(1, 101):
        current_cost = 0
        
        for length in a:
            if length < t - 1:
                current_cost += t - 1 - length
            elif length > t + 1:
                current_cost += length - (t + 1)
        
        if current_cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = current_cost
            best_t = t
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `min_cost` is the minimum cost computed across all iterations, `best_t` is the value of `t` that provides the minimum cost.
    print(best_t, min_cost)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n`, which represents the number of integers in a list `a`, and reads a list of `n` positive integers from input. It calculates the minimum cost to adjust the integers in `a` such that they fall within the range `[t - 1, t + 1]` for values of `t` from 1 to 100. The function then returns the value of `t` that results in the minimum cost and the corresponding minimum cost itself.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
