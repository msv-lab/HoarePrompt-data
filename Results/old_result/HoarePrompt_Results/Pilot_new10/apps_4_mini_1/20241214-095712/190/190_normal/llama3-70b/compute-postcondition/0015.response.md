To evaluate the effect of the given code snippet on the initial state, we analyze how `cost` is computed and what variables are influenced by this computation.

**Initial State:**
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000.
- `a` is a sorted list of integers.
- `mid` is at least 2.
- `t` is equal to `mid`.
- `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.
- `min_t` is equal to `mid - 1`.
- `i` is now `mid - 2`.

The code snippet provided is:
```
cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks)
```

Here, `cost` is computed as the sum of the minimum values between two absolute differences for each `x` in `sticks`. The two absolute differences are calculated using the variable `i` (which is `mid - 2`) and `i + 1` (which is `mid - 1`).

Since `sticks` is not defined in the initial state, we do not know its specific contents. However, we understand that `cost` will be affected based on the values of `i` and the values in `sticks`. Since `i` is defined, we can express the changes.

Now, regarding the state of the variables:
- `cost` is calculated anew based on `sticks` and the defined `i`.
- The previous state of `min_cost` will now have the value of the newly calculated `cost`, and it will change accordingly.

Therefore, the output state should reflect the new value of `cost`, and we will denote `sticks` having arbitrary values since it affects `cost` but does not change any other variables.

**Output State:**
**`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `mid` is at least 2; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is a new calculated `cost` from `sticks`; `min_t` is equal to `mid - 1`; `i` is now `mid - 2; cost is equal to the sum(min(abs(x - (mid - 2)), abs(x - (mid - 1))) for x in sticks).**
