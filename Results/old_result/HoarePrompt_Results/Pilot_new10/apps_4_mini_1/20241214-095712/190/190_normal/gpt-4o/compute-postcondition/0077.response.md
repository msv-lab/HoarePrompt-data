The variable `best_t` is assigned the value of `t`, which is 100. The value of `min_cost` remains unchanged, as it is equal to `current_cost`, and `best_t` is updated to 100. The other variables, including `current_cost`, `min_cost`, and `a`, are not affected. 

Output State: **`current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, `min_cost` is now equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is now 100, `t` is still 100, and `a` is the list of lengths processed in the loop; if `a` is empty, then `current_cost` remains 0.**
