Output State: **`current_cost` is the total cost calculated based on the differences between each element in `a` and `t - 1` or `t + 1`, `min_cost` remains 0, `best_t` remains unchanged, `t` is still 100, and `a` is the list of lengths processed in the loop. If `a` is empty, then `current_cost` remains 0, `min_cost` remains 0, `best_t` remains unchanged, and `t` is 100.**
