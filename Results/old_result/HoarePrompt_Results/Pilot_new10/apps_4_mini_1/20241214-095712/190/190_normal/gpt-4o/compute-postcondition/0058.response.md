`current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length` to its previous value. Given that `t` is 100 and `length` is less than 99, we can calculate that `t - 1 - length` equals `100 - 1 - length`, which simplifies to `99 - length`. Thus, `current_cost` becomes `0 + (99 - length)`, resulting in `current_cost` being equal to `99 - length`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`current_cost` is equal to `99 - length`, `min_cost` is 0, `best_t` remains unchanged, `t` is 100, `a` has at least 1 element, `length` is the first element of `a` during the first iteration, and the current value of `length` is less than `t - 1` (which is 99).**
