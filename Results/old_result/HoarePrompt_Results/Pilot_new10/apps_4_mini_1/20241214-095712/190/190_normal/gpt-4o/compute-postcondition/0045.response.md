The value of `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length` to it. The variable `length` is defined as the next integer in the list `a`, which means it has some specific value greater than or equal to 1. The variables `n`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect these changes.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000); `a` is a list of integers containing at least 1 integer; `length` is the next integer in `a`; `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + t - 1 - length`; `min_cost` remains unchanged; `best_t` remains at 1**.
