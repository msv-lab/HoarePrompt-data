The variable `min_cost` is initialized to positive infinity using `float('inf')`. The values of `n` and `a` are not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000, `a` is now a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is an input integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100, `min_cost` is set to positive infinity.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer within the range 1 to 1000; `a` is now a list of `n` integers where each integer `a_i` is an input integer such that 1 <= `a_i` <= 100; `min_cost` is set to float('inf').**
