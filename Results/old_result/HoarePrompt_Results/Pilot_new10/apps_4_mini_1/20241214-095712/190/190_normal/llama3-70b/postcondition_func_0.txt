The function accepts an integer `n` (between 1 and 1000) and a list `sticks` of `n` positive integers (each between 1 and 100) that represent stick lengths. It finds the optimal stick length `min_t` between 1 and 100 that minimizes the total cost of adjusting all sticks to that length, where the cost is defined as the sum of the absolute differences between each stick and the optimal length. It returns the optimal length `min_t` along with the associated minimum cost `min_cost` of adjustment.
