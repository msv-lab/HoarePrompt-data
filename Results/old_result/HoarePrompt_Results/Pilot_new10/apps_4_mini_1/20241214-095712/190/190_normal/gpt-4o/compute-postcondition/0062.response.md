Postcondition: ***`current_cost` is a positive value equal to the previous `current_cost` plus (`length - 101`), `min_cost` remains 0, `best_t` remains unchanged, `t` is 100, `a` has at least 1 element, and `length` is greater than or equal to 102 if `length` is greater than 100. Otherwise, if `length` is 100 or less, the values of `current_cost`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, `t`, `a`, and `length` remain unchanged.***
