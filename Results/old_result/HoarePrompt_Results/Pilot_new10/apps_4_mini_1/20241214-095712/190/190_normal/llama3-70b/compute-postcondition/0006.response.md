The variable `min_cost` is assigned the current value of `cost`. The values of `n`, `a`, `mid`, `cost`, and `t` remain unchanged. The output state reflects that `min_cost` is now equal to `cost`, but does not alter the values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with a value input between 1 and 1000; `a` is a sorted list of integers representing the lengths of sticks; `mid` is the value of `sticks[n // 2]; `cost` is the sum of absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and `mid`; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`.**
