The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `min_cost` remains unchanged since the operation does not affect it. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `min_t`, while keeping `min_cost` equal to `cost`.

Output State: **`min_cost` is equal to `cost`, `min_t` is equal to `i`**.
