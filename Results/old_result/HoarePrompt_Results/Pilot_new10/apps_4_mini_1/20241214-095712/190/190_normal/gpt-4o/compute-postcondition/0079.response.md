To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we first note that the outer loop iterates `t` from 1 to 100 inclusive. For each value of `t`, we compute `current_cost` based on the values in the list `a`. At the end of the loop, `min_cost` will contain the lowest cost encountered across all iterations, and `best_t` will represent the value of `t` for which this minimum cost was achieved.

Given these observations, the final output state of the variables upon exiting the loop after all iterations is as follows:

- `n` remains unchanged and is a positive integer within the range (1 <= n <= 1000).
- `a` remains unchanged and is a list of `n` integers where each integer \( a_i \) satisfies (1 <= \( a_i \) <= 100).
- `min_cost` will equal the minimum cost computed based on the values of `a` and the calculations performed for each value of `t`.
- `best_t` will be the value of `t` that resulted in `min_cost`.

Assuming the loop executes through all iterations (from `t = 1` to `t = 100`), `current_cost` gets evaluated for each of these `t` values, and the minimum across all these calculations defines `min_cost` and `best_t`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `min_cost` is the minimum cost computed across all iterations, `best_t` is the value of `t` that provides the minimum cost.**
