Postcondition: ***`current_cost` is 0, `min_cost` remains 0, and `best_t` remains unchanged. If `length` is less than 99, then `current_cost` is set to `99 - length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to 102, `current_cost` becomes the previous `current_cost` plus (`length - 101`). If `length` is 100 or less, the values of `current_cost`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, `t`, `a`, and `length` remain unchanged.***
