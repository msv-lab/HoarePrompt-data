Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found after evaluating all possible values of `i` from `mid + 1` to 100, and `min_t` is the corresponding value of `t` that minimized the cost; if the loop did not execute, `min_cost` remains equal to the initial `cost` and `min_t` is equal to `mid`.**
