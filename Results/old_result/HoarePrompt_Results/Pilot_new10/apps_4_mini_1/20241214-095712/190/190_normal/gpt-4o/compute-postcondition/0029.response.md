According to the code, the for loop iterates over `t` from 1 to 100 inclusive. The loop will execute as long as `t` is less than or equal to 100. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 1, thus the next value of `t` for the loop will be 2. Since the loop runs until `t` reaches 100 (inclusive), the conditions for the loop to execute one more time require that `t` is now 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), `a` is a list of `n` integers (1 <= `a_i` <= 100), `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`, `min_cost` is updated to the value of `current_cost`, `best_t` is set to 1, `t` is 2**
