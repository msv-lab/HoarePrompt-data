Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `mid` is at least 2; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is equal to `mid`; `i` is now `mid - 1`; `cost` is the sum of the minimum of the absolute differences between each `x` in `sticks` and `i` (mid - 1) or (mid). The current value of `cost` is less than `min_cost`.***
