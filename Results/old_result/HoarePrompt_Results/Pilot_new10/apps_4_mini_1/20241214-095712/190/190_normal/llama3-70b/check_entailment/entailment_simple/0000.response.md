To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the implementation step by step and see if it meets the requirements.

### Breakdown of the Program

1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program reads the number of sticks and their individual lengths.

2. **Sort Sticks**: 
   - The stick lengths are sorted, which helps in finding the median value efficiently.

3. **Calculate Cost Using Median**:
   - The program initially calculates the cost of converting all stick lengths to the median stick length. This initial selection of `t` is a reasonable heuristic because the median minimizes the sum of absolute deviations.

4. **Exploring Values Below the Median**:
   - The program checks for values of `t` from one less than the median down to 1. It calculates the cost for these values and updates if it finds a lower cost.

5. **Exploring Values Above the Median**:
   - Similarly, the program checks for values from one more than the median up to 100. It again calculates the cost and updates the minimum if it finds a lower cost.

6. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints the value of `t` that results in the minimum cost and the corresponding cost.

### Correctness Evaluation

**Does the program meet the problem requirements?**

- **Almost Good Sticks**: The program guarantees that every stick length will be adjusted to be "almost good" for the chosen `t` since it checks values around the median, which is a key aspect of minimizing change.
  
- **Cost Calculation**: The calculation of the total cost is based on the optimal `t` value found. Since it examines `t` from both above and below the median, it ensures that it captures the scenario that minimizes the total change necessary.
  
- **Multiple Optimal Solutions**: The program design allows for returning any optimal value of `t` when multiple options exist, as required by the problem statement.

### Conclusion

The program functions correctly according to the requirements of the problem description, as it:
- Effectively computes the closest `t` for which all stick lengths become "almost good".
- Minimizes the total change cost.
- Handles the edge cases by exploring possible values of `t`.

Thus, there are no scenarios in which the program fails to conform to the problem requirements based on its current logic and calculations.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Correctness: **True**
