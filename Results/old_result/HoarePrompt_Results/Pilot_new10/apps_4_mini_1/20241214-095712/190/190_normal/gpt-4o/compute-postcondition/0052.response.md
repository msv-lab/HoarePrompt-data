The variable `best_t` is assigned the value of `t`. The initial values of `current_cost`, `min_cost`, and `n` remain unchanged, while `best_t` is now equal to the value of `t`. Without initial knowledge of `t`, its exact value cannot be determined, but it is clear that `best_t` holds the value of `t` now.

Output State: **`current_cost` is the total cost after analyzing all elements in `a`, `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost`, `best_t` is equal to `t`, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), and `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements.**
