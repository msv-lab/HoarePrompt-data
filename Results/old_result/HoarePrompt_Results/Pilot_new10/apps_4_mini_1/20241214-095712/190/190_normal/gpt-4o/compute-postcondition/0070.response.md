The variable `current_cost` is updated by adding `t - 1 - length` to it. The values of `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `current_cost` remain unchanged, while `length` retains its meaning as the next element in the array `a`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `current_cost` is now incremented by the value of `t - 1 - length`.

Output State: **`current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + (t - 1 - length)`, `min_cost` remains 0, `best_t` remains unchanged, `length` is the next element in the array `a`.**
