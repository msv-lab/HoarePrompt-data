The variable `min_t` is assigned the value of `i`, which is currently 101. Other variables (`n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and their conditions) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects this change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `a` is a sorted list of integers; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` is 101; `i` is 101**
