Postcondition: ***`current_cost` is the total cost after analyzing all elements in `a`, `min_cost` is the original value of `current_cost`, `best_t` is 1, `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 1000), and `a` is a list of integers containing `n` elements. The current value of `current_cost` is less than `min_cost`.***
