You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum((abs(x - mid) for x in sticks))
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    print(min_t, min_cost)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to evaluate whether it properly addresses all potential cases of the problem as described. The key points from the problem statement include:

1. We need to select a positive integer `t` such that the lengths of sticks are "almost good" for `t` -- meaning for each stick length `a_i`, `|a_i - t| ≤ 1`.
2. The cost of changing stick lengths must be minimized.
3. If there are multiple optimal choices of `t`, any of them is acceptable.

Let's analyze the code provided:

1. The code reads the number of sticks and their lengths.
2. It sorts the stick lengths and calculates a potential `t` using the median of the sorted lengths.
3. It initializes the minimum cost based on the cost of changing all sticks to this median.
4. It then explores possible values of `t` by checking integers below the median and above it, calculating the corresponding costs, and updating the minimum cost and chosen `t` if a lower cost is found.
5. Finally, it prints the optimal `t` and its corresponding minimum cost.

### Identify a potential issue:
1. The code calculates costs for `t` values starting from the median, but it may overlook scenarios where the sticks can be more efficiently adjusted to lengths around `t` that are outside the scope examined.
2. Specifically, if all sticks are initially of the same length, the median calculations are trivially correct, and the cost calculation should also yield zero correctly. However, it does not thoroughly check all relevant ranges of possible `t` values immediately adjacent to the minimum stick length or maximum stick length where costs could also be potentially lower.

To illustrate an edge case example:
- If the input is:
```
5
1 1 1 1 1
```
This case tries to transform `t` to `1`, which is optimal with cost `0`. However, as all sticks equal 1, the program could theoretically check for costs when `t` is `2` or `3`, but needs to check directly adjacent because `t = 2` would incur some cost albeit being "almost good" within range.

From analyzing further, it appears the algorithm could yield incorrect results for boundary cases not tightly focused around the minimum and maximum sticks, especially if they are uniform; hence the vector changes need to be clearer.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not appropriately handle all cases, particularly where intermediate variations of `t` could yield lesser costs. It primarily focuses on the calculated median without full exploratory cost calculations.

Thus the verdict on the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer between 1 and 1000, and a is a list of integers where each integer represents the length of a stick, with each length being a positive integer between 1 and 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `a` is a sorted list of integers; if the loop executed, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found, `min_t` is the corresponding value of `t` that minimized the cost; otherwise, if the loop did not execute, `min_cost` remains equal to the initial `cost` and `min_t` is equal to `mid`.
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `min_cost` is the minimum cost found after evaluating all possible values of `i` from `mid + 1` to 100, and `min_t` is the corresponding value of `t` that minimized the cost; if the loop did not execute, `min_cost` remains equal to the initial `cost` and `min_t` is equal to `mid`.
    print(min_t, min_cost)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
