Postcondition: ***`i` is 3, `curr_start` is equal to `segments[3][0]`, `curr_end` is equal to `segments[3][1]`, `prev_start` is equal to `segments[2][0]`, `prev_end` is equal to `segments[2][1]`, and `len(segments)` is greater than 3. If `curr_start - prev_end` equals 2, `max_length` is updated to the maximum of `max_length_initial` and `curr_end - curr_start + 1 + (prev_end - prev_start + 1) + 1`. In cases where `curr_start - prev_end` does not equal 2, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
