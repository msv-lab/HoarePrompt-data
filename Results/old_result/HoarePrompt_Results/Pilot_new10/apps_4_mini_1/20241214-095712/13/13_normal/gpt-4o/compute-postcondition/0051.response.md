`prev_start` is assigned the value of the first element of the tuple at index `i - 1` of `segments`, and `prev_end` is assigned the value of the second element of the same tuple. Given that `i` is 1, this means `prev_start` and `prev_end` are now equal to the start and end indices of the first segment of consecutive 'G' characters.

The state of `i` remains unchanged, and the state of `segments` is not affected, but we now have values for `prev_start` and `prev_end`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `segments` contains tuples of start and end indices of consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`, `prev_start` is the start index of the first segment, `prev_end` is the end index of the first segment.**
