The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `trophies`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 100000 \). The parameter `trophies` is a string of length `n`, consisting solely of the characters 'G' (for golden trophies) and 'S' (for silver trophies). 

After executing the function body, the return value is determined as follows:
- If there are no consecutive 'G' characters in `trophies`, the function returns 0.
- If there is exactly one segment of consecutive 'G' characters, the function returns the maximum length of that segment.
- If there are multiple segments of consecutive 'G' characters, the function returns the minimum value between the maximum length of those segments plus 1, and `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies`, and return a value based on the presence and length of consecutive 'G' characters in the string. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `trophies`, and returns:
1. 0 if there are no consecutive 'G' characters.
2. The maximum length of a segment of consecutive 'G' characters if there is exactly one segment.
3. The minimum value between the maximum length plus 1 and `n` if there are multiple segments of consecutive 'G' characters.**
