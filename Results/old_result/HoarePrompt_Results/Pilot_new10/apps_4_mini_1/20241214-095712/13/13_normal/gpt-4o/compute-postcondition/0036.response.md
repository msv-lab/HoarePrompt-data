The value of `i` is incremented by 1. As a result, the new value of `i` becomes `i + 1`. The conditions `n` being greater than `i + 1`, `start` being equal to `i - 1`, `trophies[i]` being 'G', and `trophies[start + 1]` still holds, so the overall conditions and relations remain valid. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `start` is equal to `i - 1`, `trophies[i]` is 'G', `trophies[start + 1]` is 'G', and `i` is increased by 1**.
