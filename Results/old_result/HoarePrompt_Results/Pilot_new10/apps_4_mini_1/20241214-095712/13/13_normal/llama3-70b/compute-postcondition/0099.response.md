According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the index `j` is greater than or equal to zero. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is currently 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` will be decreased by 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, `j` will be set to -1. 

However, since the loop iterates from `i - 1` down to 0, the condition for `j` needs to allow for an additional iteration. With `i` being equal to `n - 2`, we have:

- The previous iteration checks `j`, which is 0 and `i` is `n - 2`. Therefore, `i - 1` is equal to `n - 3`, which implies that the loop will not execute again if `j` reaches -1.

In order for the loop to run once more, `i` would need to be greater than `n - 2`, which requires the adjustment of `i`. 

To summarize, we need to set `j` to -1 for the next state and maintain the given conditions about `n` and `i`.

State: **`n` must be at least 3, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `j` is -1, `beauty` remains 1**
