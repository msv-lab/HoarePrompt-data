The code executes a `break`, which causes an immediate exit from the nearest loop or switch statement, if there is one. However, in this case, none of the variables have been changed by the execution of the break statement. Therefore, the output state will maintain all the initial conditions since no operations on the variables have been performed beyond the control flow change.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `max_beauty` is unchanged, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found before reaching the end of the string (or `n` if none found), `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is greater than 0, the character at index `i` of string `s` is 'G', the character at index `i + 1` of string `s` is 'S', `j` is `i - 2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
