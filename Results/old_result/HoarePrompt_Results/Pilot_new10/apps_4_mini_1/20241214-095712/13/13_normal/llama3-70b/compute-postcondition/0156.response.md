Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to a value greater than or equal to `i + 2`. If the characters at indices from `i + 2` to the last index of the string `s` are all 'G's, then `beauty` is equal to the original `beauty` plus the count of consecutive 'G's encountered from index `i + 2` onwards. If a character other than 'G' is encountered, `beauty` reflects the count of consecutive 'G's found up to that point, and the loop terminates. If the loop does not execute, then `beauty` remains unchanged from its initial value, and `j` is equal to `n`.**
