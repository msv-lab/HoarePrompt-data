Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's in string `s`; `curr_beauty` is 0 (as it is reset at the end of the loop execution); `left` is the index of the first 'G' found before reaching the end of the string (or `n` if none found). If there are no 'G's in `s`, then `max_beauty` is 0.**
