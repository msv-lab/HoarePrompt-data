The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `beauty` while retaining all other initial values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `max_beauty` is unchanged; `left` is the index of the first 'G' found before reaching the end of the string (or `n` if none found); `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0; `curr_beauty` is set to 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', else `curr_beauty` remains 0; `j` is `i - 2`; `beauty` is incremented by 1.**
