The code assigns the values from the `segments` tuple at index `i` to `curr_start` and `curr_end`. The initial state indicates that `i` is 1 and `segments` contains tuples representing the start and end indices of consecutive 'G' characters. Thus, `curr_start` and `curr_end` will take on the values of the second tuple (the one at index 1) in the `segments` list.

Since the values of `curr_start` and `curr_end` are not provided in the initial state, they will now be assigned those corresponding values directly from `segments[i]`.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `curr_start` is equal to the start index of the second segment, `curr_end` is equal to the end index of the second segment, `segments` remains unchanged, `prev_start` is the start index of the first segment, `prev_end` is the end index of the first segment.**
