The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, so the current condition regarding `n` remains valid. The `start` was equal to `i`, so after incrementing `i`, `start` will now be one less than `i`, which does not affect any of the conditions regarding `n`, `trophies[i]`, or `trophies[start + 1]`. The values of `trophies[i]` and `trophies[start + 1]` remain valid, as they were originally 'G'. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `i` has been increased by 1, while the other conditions remain unchanged and valid.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `start` is equal to `i - 1`, `trophies[i]` is 'G', and `trophies[start + 1]` is 'G', `i` is increased by 1.**
