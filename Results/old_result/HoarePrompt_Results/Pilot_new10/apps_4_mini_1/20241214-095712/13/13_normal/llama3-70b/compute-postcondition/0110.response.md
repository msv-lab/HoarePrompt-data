The variable `beauty` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `beauty` was equal to the count of consecutive 'G' characters from the end of the `s` string up to index `i`. As a result, the new value of `beauty` is now one greater than before. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to 0, `beauty` is equal to the previous count of consecutive 'G' characters plus 1, and the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'.**
