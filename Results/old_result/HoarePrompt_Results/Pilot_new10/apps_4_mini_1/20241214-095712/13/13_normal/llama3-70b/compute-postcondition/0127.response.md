According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `i`. Specifically, the loop will execute as long as `j` is initialized at `i - 1` and decrements until it reaches `-1`. Since `i` is equal to `n - 1`, `j` will start from `n - 2` and continue to `0`, then `-1`, which means there will be a total of `n - 1` iterations (as `n - 1` is at least 1 since `n` is at least 2). 

At the point before the loop begins, `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is `n - 1`, and `beauty` is 1. The important states to maintain are that `j` must start from `i - 1`, which is `n - 2`, and should effectively allow for the loop to run at least once. Therefore, the final state should confirm that `j` is equal to `n - 2` at the start of the loop, and it is guaranteed that `n` is at least 2.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `beauty` is 1.**
