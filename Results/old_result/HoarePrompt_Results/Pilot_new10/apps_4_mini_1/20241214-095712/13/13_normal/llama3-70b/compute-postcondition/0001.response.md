`The variable s is assigned the value of input, which is a string consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'. The initial state provides that n is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, indicating that the length of string s must equal n. Therefore, after executing the code, we know that s is a string of length n, though its specific content is based on user input. The state of variable n remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'.**
