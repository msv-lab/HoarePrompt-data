According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the condition `i < n`. Given that at the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. 

Since `i` can be incremented under certain conditions, we need to ensure that even after the current iteration, the condition `i < n` still holds for the next iteration. The statement mentions that `i` is at least equal to its original value and less than `n`. Therefore, if `i` were incremented by 1, to maintain that it is less than `n`, we can conclude that for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as we have sufficient information for the loop to run again based on the provided states.

State: **`n` must be greater than `i + 1`**
