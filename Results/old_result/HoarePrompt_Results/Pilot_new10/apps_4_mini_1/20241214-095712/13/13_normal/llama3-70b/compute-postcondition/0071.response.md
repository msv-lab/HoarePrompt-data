The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the nearest loop or conditional statement we were directly within. Therefore, `n`, `max_beauty`, `left`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `curr_beauty`, and `j` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `max_beauty` is unchanged, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found before reaching the end of the string (or `n` if none found), `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `curr_beauty` is set to 1 if `s[j]` is 'G', else `curr_beauty` remains 0, and `j` is `i - 2`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
