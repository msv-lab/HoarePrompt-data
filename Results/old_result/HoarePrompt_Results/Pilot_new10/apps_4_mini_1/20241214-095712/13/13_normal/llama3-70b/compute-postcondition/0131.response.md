The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n - 2`, `beauty` is 1, and the character at index `j` of `s` is not 'G', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
