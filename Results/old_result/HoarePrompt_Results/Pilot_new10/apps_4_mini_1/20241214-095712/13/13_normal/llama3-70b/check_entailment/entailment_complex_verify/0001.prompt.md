You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vova has won $n$ trophies in different competitions. Each trophy is either golden or silver. The trophies are arranged in a row.

The beauty of the arrangement is the length of the longest subsegment consisting of golden trophies. Vova wants to swap two trophies (not necessarily adjacent ones) to make the arrangement as beautiful as possible — that means, to maximize the length of the longest such subsegment.

Help Vova! Tell him the maximum possible beauty of the arrangement if he is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 10^5$) — the number of trophies.

The second line contains $n$ characters, each of them is either G or S. If the $i$-th character is G, then the $i$-th trophy is a golden one, otherwise it's a silver trophy. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of a subsegment of golden trophies, if Vova is allowed to do at most one swap.


-----Examples-----
Input
10
GGGSGGGSGG

Output
7

Input
4
GGGG

Output
4

Input
3
SSS

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Vova has to swap trophies with indices $4$ and $10$. Thus he will obtain the sequence "GGGGGGGSGS", the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies is $7$. 

In the second example Vova can make no swaps at all. The length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence is $4$. 

In the third example Vova cannot do anything to make the length of the longest subsegment of golden trophies in the sequence greater than $0$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    golden = [i for (i, x) in enumerate(s) if x == 'G']
    max_beauty = 0
    curr_beauty = 0
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):
        if s[right] == 'G':
            curr_beauty += 1
        else:
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
            curr_beauty = 0
            while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
                left += 1
            if left < right:
                curr_beauty += 1
    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
    max_beauty_one_swap = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S':
            beauty = 1
            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            for j in range(i + 2, n):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)
    print(max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential edge cases correctly. For example, consider the following input:

```
5
GSGGG
```

Here, the longest segment of golden trophies is initially just `GGG`, which has a length of `3`. The program tries to swap the first silver trophy ('S') with any golden trophy, and it calculates a new maximum beauty of `4` due to the neighboring segments. However, there is actually a potential to swap 'S' with a 'G' to obtain `GGGGG`, resulting in a maximum beauty of `5`. 

The logic in the program does not effectively cover cases where the optimal swap occurs not just at immediate neighbors but also in a more optimal configuration. Hence, the maximum possible length calculated for this case is incorrect. 

Therefore, there exists at least one input (like the one shown) for which the program does not work correctly, leading to the conclusion that the correctness of the given program is flawed.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000, and a string of length n consisting of characters 'G' (for golden trophies) and 'S' (for silver trophies).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    golden = [i for i, x in enumerate(s) if x == 'G']
    max_beauty = 0
    curr_beauty = 0
    left = 0
    for right in range(n):
        if s[right] == 'G':
            curr_beauty += 1
        else:
            max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
            curr_beauty = 0
            while left < right and s[left] != 'G':
                left += 1
            if left < right:
                curr_beauty += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `max_beauty` is the maximum number of consecutive 'G's in string `s`; `curr_beauty` is 0 (as it is reset at the end of the loop execution); `left` is the index of the first 'G' found before reaching the end of the string (or `n` if none found). If there are no 'G's in `s`, then `max_beauty` is 0.
    max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)
    max_beauty_one_swap = 0
    for i in range(n - 1):
        if s[i] == 'G' and s[i + 1] == 'S':
            beauty = 1
            for j in range(i - 1, -1, -1):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            for j in range(i + 2, n):
                if s[j] == 'G':
                    beauty += 1
                else:
                    break
            max_beauty_one_swap = max(max_beauty_one_swap, beauty)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000; `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum beauty value calculated from the string for all eligible 'G' and 'S' pairs encountered; `curr_beauty` remains 0 as it is not updated in the loop; `left` is unchanged from its initial value and reflects the first 'G' found or `n` if none found; `beauty` is the count of 'G's that can be formed by making at most one swap with an 'S' adjacent to any 'G' found during the iterations.
    print(max(max_beauty, max_beauty_one_swap))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 <= n <= 100000) and a string `s` consisting of characters 'G' (for golden trophies) and 'S' (for silver trophies). It calculates the maximum number of consecutive 'G's that can be achieved in the string, either as-is or by swapping a single 'S' adjacent to a 'G' with another 'G'. The function returns the highest value of these consecutive 'G's. If there are no 'G's present, it returns 0.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
