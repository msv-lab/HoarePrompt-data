Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `right` is 0. If the character at index `right` of string `s` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is incremented by 1. If `left` is equal to `right` and `left` is less than `right`, then `curr_beauty` is set to 1 while `max_beauty` remains either unchanged or equal to `max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)`; the character at index `left` in `s` may be 'G' or not.***
