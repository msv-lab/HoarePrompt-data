The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `i` is 0, so after executing the code, `i` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100000; `trophies[0]` must be 'G'; `segments` is an empty list; `i` is 1; `start` is 0**
