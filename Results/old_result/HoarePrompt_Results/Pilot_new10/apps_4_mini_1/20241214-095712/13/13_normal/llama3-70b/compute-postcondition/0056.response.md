To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's analyze the provided states before the loop starts:

1. **Variable `n`:** We know that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, which indicates that there are at least two iterations in the range for the loop to execute.
2. **Loop Range:** The loop executes for `i` in the range `n - 1`. This means that for `n` set to its minimum, which is 2, the loop will effectively execute for `i` values of 0 only (since `range(1)` generates one number). For `n` set to any value greater than 2, it will iterate more times as per the value of `n`.
3. **Current State Variables:** The variables mentioned will not affect the execution regarding the range of `i`, but they are relevant for the operations within the loop body.

Since there are no issues with the loop's execution based on the provided states, all we need to ensure is that `n` remains within the bounds stated (i.e., it is at least 2). 

At the beginning of the loop:
- `i` will start at 0 for the first iteration, which is valid since `range(n - 1)` generates numbers from 0 up to `n - 2`.
- The state of the other variables (`max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, and `max_beauty_one_swap`) does not obstruct or alter the loop's ability to run.

Thus, no adjustment is necessary for the loop to execute properly as `n` falls within the required range. 

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `max_beauty` is unchanged, `curr_beauty` is 0, `left` is the index of the first 'G' found before reaching the end of the string (or `n` if none found), `max_beauty_one_swap` is 0, `i` is 0 (starting index of the loop)**
