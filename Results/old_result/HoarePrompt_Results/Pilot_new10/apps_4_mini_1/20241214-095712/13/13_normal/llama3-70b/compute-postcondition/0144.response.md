The value of `beauty` is incremented by 1. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, and `s[j]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated value of `beauty` which now increases by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to a value that allows for iteration (not `n + 1`), `beauty` is increased by 1, and the current value of `s[j]` is 'G'.**
