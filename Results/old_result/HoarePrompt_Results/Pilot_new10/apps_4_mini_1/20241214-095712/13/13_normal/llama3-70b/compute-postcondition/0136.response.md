Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is `n - 1`, and `j` is `n - 3`. If the character at index `j` of `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is set to 3. If the character at index `j` is not 'G', then `beauty` is set to 2. In the else case, if the character at index `j` of `s` is 'G', `beauty` remains 2. If the character at index `j` is not 'G', `beauty` is set to 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
