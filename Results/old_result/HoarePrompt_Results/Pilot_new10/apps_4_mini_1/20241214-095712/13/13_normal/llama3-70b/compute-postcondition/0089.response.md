The variable `max_beauty_one_swap` is being updated to the maximum value between its current value and the value of `beauty`. Since no other variables are affected directly by this line of code, we only update `max_beauty_one_swap` with the new maximum value.

Since `beauty` is defined as the total count of 'G's found in the string plus one, the only relevant information needed to determine `max_beauty_one_swap` is its current state and the value of `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 100000, `beauty` is the total count of 'G's found in the string plus one, `curr_beauty` is the number of consecutive 'G's found after index `i`, `j` is equal to `n` if no further 'G's are present beyond `i + 1`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `beauty`.**
