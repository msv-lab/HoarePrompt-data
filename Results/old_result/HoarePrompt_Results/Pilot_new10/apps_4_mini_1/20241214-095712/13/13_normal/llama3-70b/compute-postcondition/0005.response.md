The variable `left` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'G' and 'S'; `golden` is a list containing the indices of 'G' in `s`; `max_beauty` is 0; `curr_beauty` is 0; `left` is 0.
