Given the initial state and the code of the loop, I've analyzed how the variables will be affected based on the iterations of the loop. Here is the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed:

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `j` is less than 0, and `beauty` is equal to the count of consecutive 'G' characters from the end of the `s` string up to index `i`, which could vary from 1 to `i + 1` depending on the content of the string `s`.**
