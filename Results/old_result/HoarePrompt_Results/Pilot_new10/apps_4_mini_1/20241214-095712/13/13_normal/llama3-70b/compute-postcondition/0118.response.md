According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. The current value of `j` is 2, and `i` is equal to `n - 2`, so we can calculate the value of `j` at the end of the last iteration. The current range for `j` starts from `i + 2`, which is equal to `n` at this point. However, since `j` is initially set to 2 and will be increased by 1 at the next iteration, it must be re-evaluated within the for loop's range.

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased to 3, and to stay within the limits for the for loop, `j` has to remain less than `n` (which is between 2 and 100000).  

Thus, after the adjustment, the state needs to reflect that `j` is now 3, and `i`, and `n` remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is equal to `n - 2`, `j` is 3**
