Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to a value that allows for iteration. If the character at `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `s[j]` is not 'G', `beauty` is calculated as described, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
