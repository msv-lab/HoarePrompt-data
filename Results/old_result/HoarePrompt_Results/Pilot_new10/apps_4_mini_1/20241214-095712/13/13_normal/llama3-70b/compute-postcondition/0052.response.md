Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; if the character at index `right` in string `s` is 'G', then `curr_beauty` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `left` is set to the first index where `s[left]` is 'G' or `right`, `right` remains greater than or equal to 2, and if `left` is less than `right`, then `curr_beauty` is increased by 1.***
