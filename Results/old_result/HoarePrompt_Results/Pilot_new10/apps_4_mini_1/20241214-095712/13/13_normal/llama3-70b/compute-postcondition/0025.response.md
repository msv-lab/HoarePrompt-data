To determine the output state after executing the code snippet and taking into account the initial conditions, we assess what the line of code `max_beauty = max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)` does.

1. **Initial State**: We have `n`, which is an input integer in the range from 2 to 100000, and `right` is initialized to 1. However, the values for `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty` are not provided, meaning we have to treat them as unknowns for now.

2. **Impact of the Code**: 
   - The expression `max(max_beauty, curr_beauty)` will assign the greater of the two values (`max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`) to `max_beauty`. 
   - Since we do not know the specific values for `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, we cannot define the exact value of `max_beauty` post-assignment. It will remain as either its original value or potentially change based on `curr_beauty`.

3. **Conclusion**: The only variable being changed here is `max_beauty`, and due to the indeterminate nature of `curr_beauty`, we cannot specify a concrete updated value. Therefore, our output state will remain vague regarding that variable but will affirm that its value is updated based on the maximum of the two.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000, `right` is 1, `max_beauty` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `curr_beauty`**.
