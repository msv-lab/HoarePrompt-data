The code assigns `max_beauty` the maximum value between its current value and `curr_beauty`. Based on the initial state, `curr_beauty` is 0, and `max_beauty` retains its previous value. If `curr_beauty` is zero, `max_beauty` remains unchanged if it was previously positive. If `max_beauty` was also zero, it will continue to be zero. The statuses of the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100000; `max_beauty` is unchanged; `curr_beauty` is 0; `left` is the index of the first 'G' found before reaching the end of the string (or `n` if none found).**
