According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop iterates starting from `i + 2` up to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know `j` is `i + 3` and `n` is between 2 and 100000. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. 

Currently, `j` is `i + 3`, so for the loop to go to the next iteration, `j` will be `i + 4`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `i + 4`.

State: **`n` is between 2 and 100000, `j` is `i + 4`**
