The code initializes `max_beauty_one_swap` to the maximum value between its current value and `beauty`. This means that if `max_beauty_one_swap` was set previously in the program and `beauty` has been calculated based on the rules given for consecutive 'G' characters, then `max_beauty_one_swap` could either remain the same or be updated to a new value determined by the beauty calculated.

Since no specific values are provided for `max_beauty_one_swap` or `beauty`, we know that:
- `max_beauty_one_swap` will become the greater of its current value and `beauty`, which reflects the counting process of consecutive 'G' characters.

Therefore, the output state reflects that the algorithm has potentially updated `max_beauty_one_swap`, depending on the value of `beauty`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000; `i` is equal to `n - 2`; `j` is less than `n`; `beauty` is equal to the count of consecutive 'G' characters from the end of the `s` string starting from index `i + 2` onwards, incremented by the number of consecutive 'G's found if they exist before breaking. `max_beauty_one_swap` is now equal to max of its previous value and `beauty`.**
