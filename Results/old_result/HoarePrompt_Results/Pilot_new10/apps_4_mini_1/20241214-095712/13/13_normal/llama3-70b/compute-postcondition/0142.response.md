To determine whether the loop can execute, we need to analyze the variables involved:

1. The loop is defined as `for j in range(i + 2, n)`. 
2. The starting point for `j` is `i + 2`, which equals `n + 1` when `i` is `n - 1`. 
3. The loop will iterate as long as `j` is less than `n`.

Given the values:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000.
- `i` is `n - 1`, which means `i + 2` equals `n + 1`.
- Since the starting value of `j` is `n + 1` and the loop runs while `j < n`, it is impossible for the loop to execute because `n + 1` is not less than `n`.

Thus, for the loop to execute:
- We need to ensure that the value of `i` is less than `n - 2`. This indicates that `i` should not be `n - 1` if we want the loop to run since it shifts `j` to start from an invalid position.

In conclusion, for the loop to be executable:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` must be less than `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to a value that allows for iteration (i.e., cannot be `n + 1`), `beauty` is calculated as described.**
