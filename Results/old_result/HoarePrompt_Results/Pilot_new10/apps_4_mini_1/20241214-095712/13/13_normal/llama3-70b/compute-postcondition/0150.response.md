The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is initialized to `j + 1`, `beauty` remains as calculated in the previous iteration and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
