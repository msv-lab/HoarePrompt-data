To determine the necessary adjustments to the program state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, consider the following steps:

1. **Understanding the Loop Conditions**: The loop is defined as `for j in range(i + 2, n)`. This means that the loop iterates over values of `j` starting from `i + 2` and goes up to (but does not include) `n`.

2. **Current State Analysis**:
   - The current value of `i` is less than `n - 2`, which means `i + 2` is still valid within the range of `n`.
   - The variable `j` has been initialized to `j + 1`, indicating that it has already taken on one value in the last iteration, and it has been incremented.

3. **Next State Calculation**:
   - For the next iteration of the loop, `j` must increment by 1 from its last value. If we denote the last value of `j` in the previous iteration as `current_j`, we have `j = current_j + 1`.
   - Since the loop continues to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`, for the loop to execute one more time after the current configuration, it implies that `current_j + 1` must still be less than `n`.

4. **Conclusion**:
   - The next value of `j` will be `current_j + 1`, and since `j` is currently initialized to `j + 1`, we specify this value.
   - Since `i` remains unchanged, it is still less than `n - 2`, and there's no need to alter its condition.

Now, this leads to the following final state representation:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100000, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is equal to `current_j + 1` (which is as per initialization), and `beauty` remains unchanged (unless `s[j]` is 'G', but we represent it as previously calculated since this depends on conditions not fully known).**
