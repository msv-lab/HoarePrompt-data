Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. For example, consider the case where `n = 3`, `a = 2`, and `b = 3`. According to the problem:

- Each of the `n = 3` plates must have at least one piece.
- The maximum possible `x` is such that each plate has at least `x` pieces.
  
In this case, the maximum possible number of pieces that can be distributed evenly among the plates is `1`. However, the current implementation can lead to `x` being decremented incorrectly or even trying to distribute more pieces than available to plates.

The program tries to simultaneously ensure that both cakes can be distributed evenly while determining `x`, which may cause it to incorrectly miss a valid configuration. Moreover, the input hint mentioned that the maximum possible `x` does not exceed `n`, but it fails to capture cases where the largest possible value may be constrained by the smaller number of pieces available.

Thus, there exist inputs where the output will be incorrect, violating the problem requirements. The incorrect logic and potential inputs make the implementation faulty, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness for the program based on the above reasoning.
