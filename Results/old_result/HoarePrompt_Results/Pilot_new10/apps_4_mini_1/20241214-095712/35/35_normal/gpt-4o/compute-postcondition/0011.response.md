After executing the code `high = mid`, the variable `high` is assigned the value of `mid`. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, this means `high` will now be equal to the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` before the assignment. The other variables remain unchanged.

The initial constraints still hold, and we just need to reflect the updated value of `high`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `low` must be less than `high`, `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, and `high` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`.**
