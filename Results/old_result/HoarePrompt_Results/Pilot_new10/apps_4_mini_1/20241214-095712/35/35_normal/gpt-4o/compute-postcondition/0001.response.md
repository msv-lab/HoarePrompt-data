The function `can_distribute` accepts parameters `a`, `b`, `x`, and `n`. The parameters `a` and `b` are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively. The parameter `x` is a positive integer such that `x` is greater than or equal to 1. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained by the condition that it must be between 2 and the sum of `a` and `b` (inclusive). 

After executing the function body, it returns a boolean expression indicating whether the sum of the integer divisions of `a` and `b` by `x` is greater than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_distribute` is to determine if the total number of cake pieces that can be distributed, based on the number of pieces per group (`x`), meets the required minimum (`n`). 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a (pieces of the first cake), b (pieces of the second cake), x (pieces per group), and n (minimum required groups), and returns a boolean indicating whether (a // x) + (b // x) >= n.**
