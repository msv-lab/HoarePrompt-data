You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n


```
Original Assessment: To examine the correctness of the provided Python program, we'll analyze whether it follows the problem description accurately and handles all potential edge cases.

### Problem Summary:
1. We need to distribute `a` pieces of the first cake and `b` pieces of the second cake onto `n` plates.
2. Each plate must contain at least one piece.
3. No plate can have pieces from both cakes.
4. The goal is to maximize the minimum number of pieces, \( x \), such that every plate has at least \( x \) pieces.

### Analyzing the Provided Code:
1. The program uses a binary search approach to determine the maximum \( x \).
2. The `can_distribute` function checks if it is possible to distribute the pieces such that every plate gets at least \( x \) pieces.

### Issues:
- The binary search bounds are set to `(low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)`. This means the program only considers cases up to the minimum number of pieces available from either cake, which might not allow proper allocation if the total number of pieces (from both cakes) is considered.
  
- The `can_distribute` function only evaluates the total number of pieces against `n`, but does not account for the condition that each plate must have a piece from only one cake. This could lead to situations where, although the total number of distributed pieces meets the requirement, the distribution itself is invalid due to the cake plate limitation.

### Test Case to Expose the Issue:
Take the case where:
- \( n = 3 \) (number of plates)
- \( a = 5 \) (pieces of the first cake)
- \( b = 1 \) (pieces of the second cake)

Here, if we analyze:
- Each plate can get only one piece from the second cake because there is only 1 piece. Therefore, we can only have 1 plate that gets from the second cake and the rest must take from the first cake.
- The valid distribution would be (1 from the second) + (2 from the first to two plates) = 3 plates satisfied.

However, according to the code, with an initial guess \( x \) being 1, it would return true simply due to the quantity of total pieces available ignoring the individual allocation constraints related strictly to cake types.

### Conclusion:
The logic in `can_distribute()` does not ensure that plates only have pieces from the same cake, thus potentially failing in various conditions especially when distributing uneven amounts (more on one cake than the other). 

Hence the program would not correctly solve all possible scenarios as stipulated by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer (number of plates) such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b, a is an integer (number of pieces of the first cake) such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100, and b is an integer (number of pieces of the second cake) such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100.
def func_1(n, a, b):
    low, high = 1, min(a, b) + 1
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is equal to `high`, `high` is equal to `min(a, b) + 1`, and `n` remains within the range 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`. The values of `low` and `high` indicate that the binary search has concluded, and the final calculated `mid` will not fall within the bounds for further iterations. Additionally, `can_distribute(mid)` will have returned both true and false during the run, leading to the termination of the loop when `low` is no longer less than `high`.
    return low - 1
    #The program returns low - 1, where low is equal to high and indicates that the binary search has concluded, confirming that no further iterations will occur within the bounds.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n` (the number of plates, where 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b), and two integers `a` and `b` (the number of pieces of two different cakes, both between 1 and 100). The function performs a binary search to find the maximum number of plates that can be distributed based on the conditions defined in the `can_distribute` function, returning `low - 1`, where `low` is the threshold found when the binary search concludes. The function does not handle edge cases where `n` might be less than 2 or greater than `a + b`, assuming these conditions are met prior to the call.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers representing the number of pieces of the first and second cake, respectively, and x is a positive integer such that x >= 1. Additionally, n is a positive integer such that 2 <= n <= a + b.
def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n
    #The program returns a boolean expression indicating whether the sum of integer divisions of 'a' and 'b' by 'x' is greater than or equal to 'n', where 'a' and 'b' are positive integers representing pieces of cake, 'x' is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and 'n' is a positive integer with a value between 2 and 'a + b'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `x` and checks if the combined number of complete groups that can be formed from `a` pieces of the first cake and `b` pieces of the second cake, calculated as `(a // x) + (b // x)`, is greater than or equal to a specified positive integer `n`. This function returns `True` if the condition is met, and `False` otherwise. It does not directly accept `a`, `b`, or `n` as parameters, which may lead to confusion if they are not defined outside the function.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
