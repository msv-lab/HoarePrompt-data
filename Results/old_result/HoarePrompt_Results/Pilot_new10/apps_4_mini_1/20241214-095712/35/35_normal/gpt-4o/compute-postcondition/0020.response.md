The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `a`, and `b`. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of plates, constrained such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. The parameter `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, constrained such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100. The parameter `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, constrained such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100. After executing the function body, it returns a value of `low - 1`, where `low` is equal to `high`, indicating that the binary search has concluded and confirming that no further iterations will occur within the bounds. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n`, `a`, and `b`, and returns `low - 1`, where `low` is equal to `high`, indicating the conclusion of the binary search.**
