The value of `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. The previous value of `mid` is calculated as (1 + high) // 2, where `high` is min(a, b) + 1. Therefore, `low` is now greater than its previous value by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b; `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 100; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 100; `low` is now (1 + (min(a, b) + 1) // 2) + 1; `high` is min(a, b) + 1; `mid` is (1 + high) // 2; the function `can_distribute(mid)` returns true.**
