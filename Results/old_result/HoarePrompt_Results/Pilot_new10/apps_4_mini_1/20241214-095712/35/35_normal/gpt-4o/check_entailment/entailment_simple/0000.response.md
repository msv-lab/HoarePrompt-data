To verify the correctness of the program against the given problem description, we need to assess if it accurately calculates the maximum possible number \( x \) such that Ivan can distribute pieces of the cakes among \( n \) plates while adhering to the specified conditions.

### Breakdown of the Program:

1. **Input Reading**:
   - The program reads three integers \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \) which represent the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.

2. **Function Logic** (`func_1`):
   - The function initializes a binary search with `low` set to 1 and `high` set to the minimum of \( a \) and \( b \) plus one.
   - It searches for the maximum value \( x \) such that:
     - Each plate can have at least \( x \) pieces.
     - The total number of pieces that can be allocated satisfies the condition \( \text{pieces from cake 1} + \text{pieces from cake 2} \geq n \).

3. **Distribution Check** (`can_distribute`):
   - This helper function checks if it is possible to distribute the pieces such that each plate gets at least \( x \) pieces. It does that by calculating the total number of plates that can be filled with pieces from both cakes individually and ensures the sum is at least \( n \).

### Analysis of the Program's Correctness:

- The primary goal is to maximize \( x \) while ensuring all constraints are met:
  - Each plate has at least one piece of cake.
  - No plate has pieces from both cakes.
  - All pieces are distributed.

- The binary search implemented in the program is a valid approach for this kind of optimization problem. It iteratively adjusts its search based on whether \( x \) can be achieved.

- The condition `return a // x + b // x >= n` in the `can_distribute` function correctly verifies whether there are enough pieces to fill all plates with at least \( x \) pieces each, based on current values of \( a \), \( b \), and \( x \).

### Conclusion:

The algorithm correctly implements a binary search to find the largest possible minimum number of pieces each plate can have while also satisfying the distribution constraints stipulated in the problem. The program logically covers all possible scenarios defined in the description â€”

1. It processes the input to derive \( n \), \( a \), and \( b \).
2. It methodically checks all potential values for \( x \) using a binary search while ensuring the distribution is feasible.

Therefore, the program adheres to the problem description and addresses the requirements correctly.

Correctness: **True**
