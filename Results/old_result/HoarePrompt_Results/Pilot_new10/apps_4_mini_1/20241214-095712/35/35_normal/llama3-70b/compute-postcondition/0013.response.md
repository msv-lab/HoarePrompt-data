Postcondition: ***`n`, `a`, `b` are integers obtained from user input such that `2 ≤ n ≤ a + b`, `1 ≤ a ≤ 100`, `1 ≤ b ≤ 100`; `x` is equal to `min(n, a, b) - 2`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of `a - x` and `b - x` is greater than or equal to `x`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
