`low` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. Given that `mid` is equal to `(low + high) // 2`, the new value of `low` will be half of the original `low + high` incremented by 1. The states of the other variables (`n`, `high`, `mid`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `low` must be less than `high`, `high` remains unchanged, and `low` is now `mid + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ `a + b`, `low` must be less than `high`, `high` remains unchanged, and `low` is now `mid + 1`.**
