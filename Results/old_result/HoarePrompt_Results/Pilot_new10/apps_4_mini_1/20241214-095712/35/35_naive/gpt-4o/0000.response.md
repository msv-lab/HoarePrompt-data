To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze both.

**Problem Description Summary:**
We need to determine the maximum number of pieces `x` that can be distributed such that:
1. Each piece of each cake is put on some plate.
2. Each plate contains at least one piece of cake.
3. No plate contains pieces of both cakes.
4. The minimum number of pieces `x` on each plate is maximized.

Given three integers:
- `n`: number of plates
- `a`: pieces of the first cake
- `b`: pieces of the second cake

**Program Analysis:**
The program reads three integers `n`, `a`, `b`. It defines a function `func_1` to determine the maximum number of pieces `x` that can be placed on each plate while meeting the conditions specified in the problem description.

1. The binary search is set up between `1` and `min(a, b) + 1`.
2. The function `can_distribute(x)` checks if `n` plates can each hold at least `x` pieces by ensuring the total pieces from both cakes (`a // x + b // x`) is at least `n`.

**Correctness Evaluation:**
We must ensure every rule laid out in the problem description is followed for all possible inputs. Let's consider a few edge cases:

1. **Edge Case 1**: When `n = 2`, `a = 1`, `b = 1`.
   - The expected output is `1` since each plate will take one piece of either cake, satisfying the conditions perfectly.

2. **Edge Case 2**: When `n = 3`, `a = 1`, `b = 2`.
   - In this case, since there are not enough pieces of the first cake to satisfy 3 plates (plate 1 can have 1 from cake 2 only), the expected output must be `1` (only one piece can be given out). The output in this representation would still satisfy `can_distribute` checks.

3. **Edge Case 3**: When `n = 4`, `a = 7`, `b = 10`.
   - The expected maximum `x` is `3` since we could have:
     - 2 plates with 3 pieces each from the first (6 total, which allows one plate left empty) and 
     - 2 plates with 5 pieces each from the second (including `1st` after taking out from total 10).

After testing several cases, the searching method combined with the checks in `can_distribute` seem correct as it validates the capacity of `x` pieces efficiently.

All described logical checks accommodate for full coverage of the specified conditions. Hence, I would conclude that despite the potentially conflicting cases (not finding a conflict example), the function fulfills the description reliably.

**Final Assessment:**
Correctness: **True**.
