You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: After seeing the "ALL YOUR BASE ARE BELONG TO US" meme for the first time, numbers X and Y realised that they have different bases, which complicated their relations.

You're given a number X represented in base b_{x} and a number Y represented in base b_{y}. Compare those two numbers.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two space-separated integers n and b_{x} (1 ≤ n ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{x} ≤ 40), where n is the number of digits in the b_{x}-based representation of X. 

The second line contains n space-separated integers x_1, x_2, ..., x_{n} (0 ≤ x_{i} < b_{x}) — the digits of X. They are given in the order from the most significant digit to the least significant one.

The following two lines describe Y in the same way: the third line contains two space-separated integers m and b_{y} (1 ≤ m ≤ 10, 2 ≤ b_{y} ≤ 40, b_{x} ≠ b_{y}), where m is the number of digits in the b_{y}-based representation of Y, and the fourth line contains m space-separated integers y_1, y_2, ..., y_{m} (0 ≤ y_{i} < b_{y}) — the digits of Y.

There will be no leading zeroes. Both X and Y will be positive. All digits of both numbers are given in the standard decimal numeral system.


-----Output-----

Output a single character (quotes for clarity):   '<' if X < Y  '>' if X > Y  '=' if X = Y 


-----Examples-----
Input
6 2
1 0 1 1 1 1
2 10
4 7

Output

15 15 4 0 0 7 10
7 9

Output

-----Note-----

In the first sample, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 = Y.

In the second sample, X = 102_3 = 21_5 and Y = 24_5 = 112_3, thus X < Y.

In the third sample, $X = FF 4007 A_{16}$ and Y = 4803150_9. We may notice that X starts with much larger digits and b_{x} is much larger than b_{y}, so X is clearly larger than Y.
Program:
```
(n, base_x) = map(int, input().split())
digits_x = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, base_y) = map(int, input().split())
digits_y = list(map(int, input().split()))
decimal_x = func_1(digits_x, base_x)
decimal_y = func_1(digits_y, base_y)
if decimal_x < decimal_y:
    print('<')
elif decimal_x > decimal_y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(digits, base):
    decimal_value = 0
    for digit in digits:
        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
    return decimal_value


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the provided Python program according to the problem description, we need to analyze if it handles all input scenarios correctly.

### Given Problem Description:
The program is supposed to read two numbers represented in different bases and compare their values. The input includes the number of digits, the bases, and the respective digits of each number. The output should be one of three characters ('<', '>', '=') based on the comparison of the two values converted to decimal.

### Given Program:
```python
(n, base_x) = map(int, input().split())
digits_x = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, base_y) = map(int, input().split())
digits_y = list(map(int, input().split()))
decimal_x = func_1(digits_x, base_x)
decimal_y = func_1(digits_y, base_y)
if decimal_x < decimal_y:
    print('<')
elif decimal_x > decimal_y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

def func_1(digits, base):
    decimal_value = 0
    for digit in digits:
        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
    return decimal_value
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Conversion Functionality**:
   - The function `func_1` converts a list of digits in a given base to its decimal equivalent. It works by iteratively multiplying the current accumulated value by the base and adding the next digit. This is a correct implementation for base conversion.

2. **Input Handling**:
   - The program correctly reads inputs for the two numbers and their respective bases.

3. **Comparison Logic**:
   - After converting both numbers to decimal, the program compares the two decimal values and prints the appropriate comparison character.

### Cases to Test:
- **Valid Inputs**: Ensuring the program outputs correctly for provided examples verifies that it operates correctly.
- **Edge Cases**: We would need to consider edge cases like:
  - The minimum input sizes.
  - Maximum number representations within the constraints.
  - Maximum values for bases to ensure it handles the largest decimal conversions properly.

### Potential Issue Found:
- The program assumes that all digits will be valid for the specified base (i.e., `0 ≤ x_i < b_x`). However, if someone provides an invalid digit (e.g., digit `b_x` or above), the program would not handle it. The constraints in the problem state valid digits, but if we consider user input directly, this could lead to an error that is not managed by the current implementation.

### Conclusion:
While the main logic of the conversion and comparison processes is correct, there is a flaw with input validation (ensuring digits are valid for their respective bases). This could lead to incorrect behavior if invalid input is provided.

Correctness: **False**. 

Example Issue: If `base_x` is 3 and the input digit is "3", the code does not explicitly validate this, leading to a potential error in conversion.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
(n, base_x) = map(int, input().split())
digits_x = list(map(int, input().split()))
(m, base_y) = map(int, input().split())
digits_y = list(map(int, input().split()))
decimal_x = func_1(digits_x, base_x)
decimal_y = func_1(digits_y, base_y)
if decimal_x < decimal_y:
    print('<')
elif decimal_x > decimal_y:
    print('>')
else:
    print('=')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in the specified base, and base is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40. The length of digits is between 1 and 10, and each digit is non-negative and less than the base.
def func_1(digits, base):
    decimal_value = 0
    for digit in digits:
        decimal_value = decimal_value * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `decimal_value` is the decimal representation of the integer formed by the digits in the list `digits` in base `base`; if `digits` is empty, then `decimal_value` is 0.
    return decimal_value
    #The program returns the decimal representation of the integer formed by the digits in the list 'digits' in base 'base', which is stored in 'decimal_value'. If 'digits' is empty, 'decimal_value' is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits` representing the digits of a number, and an integer `base` between 2 and 40. It returns the decimal representation of the number formed by `digits` in the specified `base`. The function does not handle cases where `digits` contains invalid values (i.e., values not less than the `base`), which could lead to incorrect calculations or assumptions about what constitutes valid input. If `digits` is empty, a return value of 0 is given, as per the annotations.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
