Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description for comparison of two numbers represented in different bases. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: 
    - The program correctly reads the input in the specified format, with two integers indicating the number of digits and the base for each number. It captures the digits as lists of integers.
  
2. **Conversion to Decimal**:
    - The function `func_1` converts a number represented by its digits in a specified base to its equivalent decimal value (base 10). This is done using the standard formula for converting from base `b` to decimal:
      \[
      \text{result} = \sum_{i=0}^{n-1} (\text{digits}[i] \times b^{(n-i-1)})
      \]
      where `n` is the number of digits. The program effectively builds the decimal number iteratively by multiplying the current result by the base and adding the next digit.
  
3. **Comparison Logic**:
    - After converting both numbers (X and Y) to their decimal equivalents, the program performs a comparison:
        - It prints `<` if X is less than Y,
        - `>` if X is greater than Y,
        - and `=` if they are equal.
  
4. **Meeting Constraints**:
    - The program adheres to all constraints mentioned in the problem (e.g., valid digit ranges, no leading zeros, valid base ranges). 
    - The edge cases for the lowest and highest base values are also inherently managed by the conversion logic in `func_1`.

5. **Output Format**:
    - The output is formatted correctly as specified, producing only one character indicating the relationship between X and Y.

Given all these points, the program meets the requirements of the problem description satisfactorily for all possible valid input cases defined by the problem.

Therefore, the conclusion is that the program is correct:
Correctness: **True**
