Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The provided program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem. The annotations support this conclusion, confirming that:

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads the inputs for both numbers, including their digits and respective bases, adhering to the constraints outlined (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10, and 2 ≤ b_x, b_y ≤ 40).

2. **Conversion to Decimal**: The function `func_1` efficiently converts a number represented in an arbitrary base to its decimal equivalent. The annotations clearly indicate that the result is calculated correctly using the formula, and they reaffirm that the digits remain valid (i.e., non-negative and less than their respective bases).

3. **Comparison Logic**: After converting both numbers to decimal representation, the program correctly compares the two results. The logic and output handling for comparing the values align with the required outcomes of the problem description.

Overall, the implementation appears robust and adheres to the problem requirements. The acknowledgment that the input will be valid mitigates concerns regarding edge cases not handled explicitly in the code. Thus, the program is functioning as intended, and the original assessment that it is correct stands validated.
