The original assessment is accurate and aligns well with the problem description and the provided code.

The program correctly reads input values for two numbers in different bases, converts these numbers from their respective bases to decimal using the `func_1` function, and finally compares these decimal values to output the correct relational symbol ('<', '>', or '=').

The annotations reinforce this conclusion by establishing clear expectations at various points in the code:
1. The state before the function call confirms that the inputs are well-defined, with digits being non-negative and less than the respective bases.
2. After executing the conversion function, the state indicates that `result` holds the correct converted value, consistent with the expected behavior of converting a number from a given base to decimal.

Since all parts of the program adhere to the input specifications, perform the necessary conversions, and yield the correct relational output, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
