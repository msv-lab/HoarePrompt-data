To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze how the program works and whether it adheres to the requirements outlined.

The program reads two numbers (X and Y) in different bases and compares their decimal equivalences after converting them from their respective bases. 

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the inputs for both numbers, including the bases and the digit values.
 
2. **Conversion Function (`func_1`)**: This function converts an array of digits in a given base to its decimal equivalent. It performs the conversion using an iterative approach, multiplying the current decimal value by the base and adding the next digit. 

3. **Comparison Logic**: After obtaining the decimal representation for both numbers, the program compares them and prints '<', '>', or '=' accordingly.

**Potential Issues**:
- The hints mention that the implementation does not check whether any of the digits provided in the inputs are invalid (i.e., whether they are less than the respective base). If any digit in `digits_x` or `digits_y` is not valid (that is `digit >= base`), the conversion will give incorrect results. This is a potential failure point not handled by the code.

**Examples**:

- If we provide an input like this:
```
2 5
3 2
1 3
```
- Here, `3` is not a valid digit for base `5`, but the code will still convert it to decimal without raising an error, leading to an invalid and incorrect output.

Thus, since there are potential inputs that could break the program's assumptions and yield incorrect results, we can definitively state that the code does not meet the requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
