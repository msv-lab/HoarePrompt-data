According to the code, the loop will execute if the `digits` list is not empty. The variable `digit` will represent each element in the `digits` list as the loop iterates. The value of `decimal_value` is not directly impacting the loop execution but will change as the loop processes each digit. 

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to confirm that `digits` contains at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `digit` would correspond to the last element in `digits`.

State: **`digits` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, `decimal_value` is 0, `digit` is the first element of digits**
