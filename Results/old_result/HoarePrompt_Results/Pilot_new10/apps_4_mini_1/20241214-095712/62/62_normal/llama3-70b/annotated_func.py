#State of the program right berfore the function call: digits is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in a specified base, and base is an integer such that 2 <= base <= 40. Additionally, the number of digits is between 1 and 10, and each digit is non-negative and less than the base.
def func_1(digits, base):
    result = 0
    for digit in digits:
        result = result * base + digit
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `result` is equal to the value represented by `digits` in the specified `base`, `digits` is a list of integers, `base` is an integer such that 2 <= base <= 40. If `digits` is empty, then `result` is 0.
    return result
    #The program returns the value of 'result' which is equal to the value represented by 'digits' in the specified 'base'; if 'digits' is empty, then 'result' is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `digits` representing the digits of a number in a specified base and an integer `base` (where 2 <= base <= 40). It calculates and returns the numeric value of the number represented by `digits` in the specified base. If `digits` is empty, the function returns 0.
