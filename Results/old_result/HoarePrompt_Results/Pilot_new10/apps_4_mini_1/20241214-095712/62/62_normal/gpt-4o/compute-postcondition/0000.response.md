The variable `decimal_value` is initialized to 0, which indicates the start value for the conversion of the list of digits from the specified base to its decimal representation. The other variables (`digits` and `base`) remain unchanged as they are just preconditions necessary for further calculations. 

Output State: **`digits` is a list of integers representing the digits of a number in the specified base; `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ base ≤ 40; `decimal_value` is 0.**
