The value of `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the result of the expression `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`. Since `s[i]` is a vowel, we know that `last_vowel` is initially greater than or equal to 0. The exact values of `i` and `last_vowel` are not explicitly defined, but we know that the calculation will yield a non-negative integer for `max_jump`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_jump` is updated to `max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)`, `last_vowel` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is still 0, and `s[i]` is a vowel.**
