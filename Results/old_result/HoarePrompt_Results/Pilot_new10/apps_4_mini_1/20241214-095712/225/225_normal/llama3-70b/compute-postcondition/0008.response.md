The value of `max_jump` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `i + 1`. The initial value of `max_jump` is 0, and since `i` is currently 0 (as per the initial conditions), `max_jump` will be updated to the maximum of 0 and 1, which is 1. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_jump` is 1, `last_vowel` is -1, `i` is 0, and since the last vowel index is -1, this indicates that there has been no vowel encountered before the current character `s[i]`, which is a vowel.**
