The value of `last_vowel` is assigned `-1`. This means that `last_vowel` is initialized to `-1`, but the states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `last_vowel` has this new value while other variables maintain their original states.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters with a length between 1 and 100; `vowels` is 'AEIOUY'; `n` is a value between 1 and 100; `max_jump` is 0; `last_vowel` is -1.**
