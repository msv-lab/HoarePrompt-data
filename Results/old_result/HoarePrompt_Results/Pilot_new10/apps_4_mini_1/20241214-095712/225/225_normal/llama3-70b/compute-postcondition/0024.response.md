The value of `last_vowel` is assigned the value of `i`. The variable `i` is currently 2, so `last_vowel` now becomes 2. This changes the value of `last_vowel` from 1 to 2. The values of other variables remain unaffected. The output state reflects this update in the state of `last_vowel`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than 2, `last_vowel` is 2, `max_jump` is either 1 or 2, and `i` is 2.**
