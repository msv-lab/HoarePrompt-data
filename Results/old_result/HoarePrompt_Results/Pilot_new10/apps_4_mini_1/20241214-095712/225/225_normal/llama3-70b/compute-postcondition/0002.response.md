The variable `n` is assigned the value `len(s)`, which represents the length of the non-empty string `s`. Since `s` is defined as a non-empty string with capital English letters and has a length not exceeding 100, `n` will hold a value between 1 and 100. The states of the other variables (`s` and `vowels`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters with a length between 1 and 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is a value between 1 and 100**.
