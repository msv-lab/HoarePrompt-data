The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, and the length of `s` does not exceed 100. The function returns `max_jump`, which is the maximum value between the previous `max_jump` and the difference between the length of string `s` and the index of the last vowel found (`prev_pos`). If no vowels exist, `prev_pos` can be -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-empty string `s` comprised of capital English letters and return the maximum jump calculated based on the position of the last vowel. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty string s consisting of capital English letters and returns the maximum jump based on the position of the last vowel in the string.**
