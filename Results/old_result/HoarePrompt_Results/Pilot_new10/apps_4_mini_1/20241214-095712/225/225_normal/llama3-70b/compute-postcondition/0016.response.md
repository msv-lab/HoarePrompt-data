To determine the output state after executing the code, we analyze the impact of the code snippet on the variables given the initial state.

1. The code `max_jump = max(max_jump, (i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1)` involves calculating a new value for `max_jump`.
2. The value of `max_jump` is updated to be the maximum between its current value and the computed value from `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`.
3. In the initial state, `max_jump` is set to 1, `last_vowel` is 0, and `i` is 1.

Now, let's compute the new value:

- Calculate `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`:
  - Substitute the values: `(1 - 0) // 2 + 1 = 1 // 2 + 1 = 0 + 1 = 1`.

4. Now, we compare the two values:
   - Current value of `max_jump` = 1
   - Computed value = 1
   - Therefore, `max_jump` remains 1 because `max(1, 1)` equals 1.

The states of the other variables do not change, and the other initial states remain valid after executing the code.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `last_vowel` stays as 0, `max_jump` is 1, `i` is 1**.
