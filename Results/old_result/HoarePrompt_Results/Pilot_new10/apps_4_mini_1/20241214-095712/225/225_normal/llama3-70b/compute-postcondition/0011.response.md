Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters. If `last_vowel` is -1, it indicates that no previous vowels have been encountered, and `max_jump` is set to 1. If `last_vowel` is greater than or equal to 0, `max_jump` is updated to the maximum between its current value and `(i - last_vowel) // 2 + 1`, with `last_vowel` now reflecting the index of the last encountered vowel. The value of `i` remains 0, and `s[i]` is a vowel.***
