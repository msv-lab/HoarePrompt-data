The value of `last_vowel` is assigned the value of `i`, which was previously set to 1 and remains unchanged in both scenarios regarding `last_vowel`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `last_vowel` is 1, `max_jump` is either 2 or 1 (depending on the value of `last_vowel`), and `i` is still 1.**
