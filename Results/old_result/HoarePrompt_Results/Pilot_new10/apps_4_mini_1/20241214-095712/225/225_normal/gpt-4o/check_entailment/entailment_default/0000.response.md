The provided program attempts to determine the maximum jump ability the Grasshopper requires to reach the end of a string by only landing on vowels. The function computes the distance between consecutive vowels and considers the distance from the start of the string to the first vowel and from the last vowel to the end of the string.

### Analysis
1. The program correctly identifies vowels and computes the maximum distance (or jump) between them.
2. It correctly initializes the previous position to `-1` to account for situations where the first character(s) might be non-vowels.
3. The final computation properly accounts for the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string.
4. Based on the hints, if there are no vowels, the distance from the beginning to the end of the string should be considered, which the program handles by returning `len(s)` if `prev_pos` remains `-1`.

### Potential Edge Cases
However, we need to consider the case when there are no vowels in the string, which would be an edge case. In this scenario, the `prev_pos` would stay `-1`, and `max_jump` should properly return `len(s)`. This behavior is explained in the output hints and aligns with the implementation.

### Conclusion
After evaluating the implementation and confirming that it behaves as prescribed in the problem description (including handling edge cases), there are no identifiable errors or omissions in the logic.

Correctness: **True**.
