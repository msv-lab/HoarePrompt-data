Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it fails to account for the jump distance between occurrences of vowels correctly in all scenarios. For example, the provided logic for calculating the maximum jump ability by dividing the distance between vowels by 2 does not handle cases where the distance might need to be measured differently. 

Consider the input "ABABBBACFEYUKOTT". The expected jumps (vowel indices) are at positions 1, 7, 8, and 12. The jumps between these vowels are of lengths:
- From before position 1 (0) to 1: distance = 1
- From 1 to 7: distance = 6
- From 7 to 8: distance = 1
- From 8 to 12: distance = 4
Thus, the maximum jump ability required should be the maximum of these distances, which is 6, but the current implementation mistakenly computes it as a maximum between each vowel pair. This leads to incorrect outcomes for inputs where the vowels are spaced variably. 

This indicates that the program does not cover every potential case correctly, hence the correctness statement is false.
