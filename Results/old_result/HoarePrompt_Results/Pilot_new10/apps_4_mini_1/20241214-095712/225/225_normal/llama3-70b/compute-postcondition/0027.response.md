Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel found in `s` (or -1 if none found), and `max_jump` is the maximum jump calculated based on the positions of vowels in `s`. The current value of `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, indicating that the last character of `s` is not a vowel.***
