According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of the length of the string `s`. The variable `i` represents the current index of the string that is being processed. Since `i` is currently 0 and the loop will increment `i` by 1 in the next iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, since `i` is 0 and the string `s` is a non-empty string, the next value of `i` will be 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be 1, and for that, the length of `s` must be at least 2 (since `i` must remain less than the length of `s`).

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is 0 when `s[0]` is a vowel, `i` is 1**
