The variable `max_jump` is reassigned the value of `max(max_jump, i + 1)`. The current value of `i` is 2, so `i + 1` equals 3. The function `max` will compare the current values of `max_jump` (either 2 or 1) with 3. Therefore, if `max_jump` is 2, it will be updated to 3, and if it is 1, it will also be updated to 3. 

After executing this line of code, the values for `s`, `vowels`, `n`, and `last_vowel` remain unchanged, while `max_jump` will now be 3 regardless of its initial value and `i` remains 2.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` must be greater than 2, `last_vowel` is set to 1, `max_jump` is 3, and `i` is 2.**
