The variable `last_vowel` is assigned the value of `i`, which is provided as `0`. Since `s[i]` is a vowel, this means that `last_vowel` is now `0`, and we confirm that `max_jump` remains unchanged because it was initialized based on the condition of `last_vowel` being `-1` (which sets `max_jump` to `1`). The value of `i` remains `0`, and since we are not modifying `max_jump` in this step, we retain its state.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of capital English letters, `last_vowel` is 0, `max_jump` is 1, `i` is 0**
