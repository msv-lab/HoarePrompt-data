To analyze the correctness of the provided program concerning the given problem description, we need to verify whether it correctly finds fractions \( \frac{a_i}{b_i} \) such that:

1. \( b_i \) divides \( n \), \( 1 < b_i < n \)
2. \( 1 \le a_i < b_i \)
3. The sum \( \sum \frac{a_i}{b_i} = 1 - \frac{1}{n} \)

Here's the program provided:

```python
import math

n = int(input().strip())
result = func_1(n)
print(result)

def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 'NO'
    divisors = []
    for i in range(2, int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            divisors.append(i)
            if i != n // i:
                divisors.append(n // i)
    if not divisors:
        return 'NO'
    k = len(divisors)
    fractions = [(1, d) for d in divisors]
    return f'YES\n{k}\n' + '\n'.join((f'{a} {b}' for (a, b) in fractions))
```

### Testing the program:

1. **Case when \( n = 2 \)**:
   - The output is "NO", which is correct because there are no divisors \( b_i \) that meet the \( 1 < b_i < n \) condition.

2. **Case when \( n = 3 \)**:
   - The program will output "NO" because the only divisor is 3, which does not satisfy \( 1 < b_i < 3 \).

3. **Case when \( n = 4 \)**:
   - The divisors would be 2. The program outputs:
     ```
     YES
     1
     1 2
     ```
   - This is correct, and \( \frac{1}{2} = 1 - \frac{1}{4} \).

4. **Case when \( n = 5 \)**:
   - The output is "NO", which is correct since 5 is prime and the only divisor is 5 itself.

5. **Case when \( n = 6 \)**:
   - The program finds the divisors [2, 3] and outputs:
     ```
     YES
     2
     1 2
     1 3
     ```
   - \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} = \frac{3}{6} = 1 - \frac{1}{6} \) which is correct.

### Problematic Case:

- **Case when \( n = 12 \)**:
   - Divisors would be [2, 3, 4, 6]. 
   - The program will output:
     ```
     YES
     4
     1 2
     1 3
     1 4
     1 6
     ```
   - However, the correct sum should equal \( 1 - \frac{1}{12} = \frac{11}{12} \), and \( \frac{1}{2} + \frac{1}{3} + \frac{1}{4} + \frac{1}{6} = 1\), which is incorrect.

Since there are cases where the output does not meet the requirements of the problem description, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**.
