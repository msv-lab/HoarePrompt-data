The code `divisors.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the list `divisors`. The initial state states that `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3`, `i` is `i_last + 1`, and `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= i`. The value of `divisors` is not mentioned in the initial state, but it is assumed to be defined as a list.

Since `i` has a value that's based on `i_last`, and `n` meets the conditions stated (being a positive integer greater than or equal to 3), the appending operation will not alter the validity of the existing conditions.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3`, `i` is `i_last + 1`, `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= i`, `divisors` now includes the current value of `i`.**
