According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `i_last + 1`, which means `i` is currently equal to `i_last + 1`.

Since the condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, we need to ensure that `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3`, and with the current value of `i`, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be increased to `i + 1` and must still be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`.

Specifically:
- If `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(n))`, it will not execute again because the loop condition will fail.
- If `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(n))`, then it can execute again.

Therefore, we need to set the states accordingly for it to be valid for the next iteration based on the possibility of executing the loop again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n >= 3`, `i` is `i_last + 2`, and `int(math.sqrt(n)) >= i_last + 2**
