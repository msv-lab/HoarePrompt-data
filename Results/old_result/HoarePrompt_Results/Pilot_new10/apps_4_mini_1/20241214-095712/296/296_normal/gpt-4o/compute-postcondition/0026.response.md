The variable `fractions` is assigned a list of tuples, where each tuple consists of a numerator `1` and a denominator `d`, for every divisor `d` in the list `divisors`. The list `divisors` remains unchanged, and since `k` is equal to the length of `divisors`, it behaves as a count of the number of valid divisors present. Therefore, the output state reflects these changes.

Output State: **`divisors` contains all divisors of `n` greater than or equal to 2; `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is greater than or equal to 3; `k` is a positive integer equal to the length of `divisors`; `fractions` is a list of tuples with the format (1, d) for each divisor d in `divisors`.**
