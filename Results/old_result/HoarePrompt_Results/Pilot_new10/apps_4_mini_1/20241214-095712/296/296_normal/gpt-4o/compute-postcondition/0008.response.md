The code appends `n // i` to the `divisors` list. Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3 and `i` is 2, `n // i` will yield an integer result that is either equal to 1 (if n = 2) or greater than or equal to 1 for any n >= 3. Since the current value of `i` is not equal to `n // i`, it confirms that `i` (which is 2) is different from the result of `n // i`. The values of `n`, `divisors`, and `i` will remain valid post-execution, but the `divisors` list will be updated to include the new value.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` >= 3; `divisors` is now [2, n // 2]; `i` is 2**.
