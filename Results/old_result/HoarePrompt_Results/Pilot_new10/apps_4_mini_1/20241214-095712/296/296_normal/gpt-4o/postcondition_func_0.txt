The function accepts a positive integer `n`. It returns 'NO' if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is greater than 2 and has no divisors (meaning it is prime), it returns 'NO'. If divisors exist, it returns 'YES', the count of these divisors, and a list of fractions formatted as '1 d' for each divisor `d` of `n`. This means that if `n` is a prime number, it will still return 'NO' instead of returning an empty list indicating no valid fractions. The function does not directly handle the case of `n` being a prime number in the annotations, which is a potential missing point.
