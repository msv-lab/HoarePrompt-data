The statement `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' to the console but does not change the value of `n` or any other variables. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^9, and the current value of `n` is equal to 2; output 'NO' is printed**.
