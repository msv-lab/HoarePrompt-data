According to the code, the loop iterates over a range starting from 2 up to the integer value of the square root of `n` plus 1. The loop will execute as long as the starting point (2) is less than or equal to the ending point (which is `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`). 

Since `n` is a positive integer with the condition `2 <= n <= 10^9` and `n` is greater than 2, the lowest value of `n` that satisfies this condition is 3. The square root of 3 is approximately 1.73, and when we take the integer value, it is 1. So for the range function, it calculates up to `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1`, which would give us 2 in this case. 

Thus, when `n` is 3, the loop will execute for `i` starting from 2 up to and including 2, meaning it will run exactly one time. If `n` is larger, `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` will just increase, allowing more iterations. 

Therefore, before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 2, and since `divisors` is being initialized as an empty list, it will not affect the execution of the loop.

For the loop to be executed:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 to ensure that `int(math.sqrt(n)) + 1` is at least 2.
- At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that `n` >= 3, `divisors` is an empty list, `i` is 2**
