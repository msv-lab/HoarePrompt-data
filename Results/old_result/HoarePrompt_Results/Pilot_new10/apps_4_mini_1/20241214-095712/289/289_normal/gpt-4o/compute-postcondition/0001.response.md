The value of `max_games` is assigned the value of `n.bit_length() - 1`. The `bit_length()` method gives the number of bits required to represent the integer `n` in binary, which will range from 1 to 60 for the given constraints (as \(10^{18}\) is less than \(2^{60}\)). Since `n` is a positive integer in the range specified, `bit_length()` will produce values from 2 to 60. Therefore, `max_games` will range from 1 (when `n` is 2) to 59 (when `n` is \(10^{18}\)). 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^18; `max_games` is in the range from 1 to 59, specifically `max_games` equals `n.bit_length() - 1`.**
