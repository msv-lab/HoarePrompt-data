#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer in the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, representing the number of players participating in the tournament.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(n.bit_length() - 1)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function prompts the user to input an integer `n`, representing the number of players in a tournament with a valid range of 2 to 10^18. It then calculates and prints the bit length of `n` minus one, which effectively returns one less than the number of bits required to represent `n` in binary. The function does not handle invalid inputs or cases where `n` falls outside the specified range.
