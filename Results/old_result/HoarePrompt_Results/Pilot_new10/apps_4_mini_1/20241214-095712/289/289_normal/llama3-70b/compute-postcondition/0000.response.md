The variable `n` is assigned the value calculated from `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The range of `n` provided in the initial state remains valid after execution, but the value will be set to whatever integer is input by the user, as long as it adheres to the constraint 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. 

Since we do not know the specific input value provided at runtime, we cannot define `n` with a fixed value, but we acknowledge that `n` will now represent the input integer. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer in the range 2 ≤ n ≤ 10^18**
