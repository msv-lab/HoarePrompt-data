The `print(max_games)` statement outputs the value of `max_games` without changing it. Since `max_games` is defined as `n.bit_length() - 1`, we can derive its specific value based on the value of `n`. Given that `n` is a positive integer satisfying the condition \( 2 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \), we know that `max_games` will be in the range from 1 to 59 due to how `bit_length` works for these values of `n`.

The output does not affect any other variables. Thus, the Output State remains with all information intact.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 10^18; `max_games` equals `n.bit_length() - 1`, and the value of `max_games` is printed.**
