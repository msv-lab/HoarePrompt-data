The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with the constraint that `n` is a positive integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), which represents the number of players participating in the tournament. However, since no inputs are explicitly provided to the function, we cannot determine the return value or behavior of the function based solely on this description. 

Functionality: **The function has no input parameters and its functionality cannot be determined from the provided information.**
