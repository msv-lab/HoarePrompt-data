Correctness: **True**.

The program calculates the maximum number of games the winner can participate in by using the bit length of the number of players `n`. The function `n.bit_length() - 1` effectively counts how many times we can halve `n` until we reach 1, which corresponds to the maximum number of games (rounds) in a knockout tournament. 

For example:
- For `n = 2`, the winner can participate in 1 game.
- For `n = 3`, the winner can participate in 2 games (1 vs 2, then winner vs 3).
- For `n = 4`, the winner can also participate in 2 games due to the pairing system.
- For `n = 10`, the winner can participate in 4 games.

The logic is correct because the knockout format will always require pairing players, and the bit length calculation captures the rounds correctly without violating the game's play rules. Thus, the program meets the problem's requirements for all valid inputs.
