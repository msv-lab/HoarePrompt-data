You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
    if count_zeros == k:
        print(to_remove)
    else:
        print(len(n) - 1)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program carefully.

### Problem Analysis:
1. We want to remove the least number of digits from `n` such that the resulting number is divisible by \(10^k\).
2. The resulting number must have exactly `k` zeros at the end, thus we only care about the last `k` digits after removing unnecessary digits.
3. The output should be the number of digits removed to achieve a number that meets these criteria.

### Program Logic:
1. The program takes input values of `n` and `k`.
2. It initializes `count_zeros` to count the zeros found at the end of the reversed number and `to_remove` to count the non-zero digits removed.
3. It iterates over the digits of `n` in reverse:
   - Counts the zeros and once `k` zeros have been found, it stops counting further.
   - For every digit that is not a zero, it increments the `to_remove` counter.
4. If `count_zeros` equals `k` after the loop, it prints the number of non-zero digits removed (`to_remove`).
5. If `count_zeros` is less than `k`, it defaults to print the total length of `n` minus one (`len(n) - 1`).

### Potential Issue:
The program has a potential problem in handling certain input cases. For instance:
- If the number is `1000000000` and `k = 9`, the requirement is to retain 9 zeros. However, since there is a single non-zero digit (`1`), it would remove it entirely and give an output of `1`. This is incorrect, as the minimum digits to remove should allow to keep `0` with no leading zeros, and the correct output should be `1` since keeping `0` (or retaining it) does not violate the leading zero restriction.

### Other Test Cases:
- For `n = 30020` and `k = 3`, the program does produce `1`, which is correct since it can retain `3000`.
- For `n = 100` and `k = 2`, the output of `2` is again correct, as it can retain just `0`.
- For `n = 10203049` and `k = 2`, the program correctly identifies it needs to remove 3 digits to get to `0` for divisibility.

Despite the cases that seem to be handled correctly, the edge case where too few zeros are found causing an incorrect calculation of digits to remove shows a flaw in the logic. 

### Conclusion:
Therefore, since I found a case where the program does not behave correctly according to the problem specifications:

Correctness: **False** 

The default case handles with `len(n) - 1` may lead to incorrect results when `n` must have `k` zeros at the end, and we should retain trailing zeros even in cases where we most likely keep leading zeros constraints in mind.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000 and k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 9.
def func():
    n, k = map(str, input().split())
    k = int(k)
    count_zeros = 0
    to_remove = 0
    for digit in reversed(n):
        if digit == '0':
            count_zeros += 1
        else:
            to_remove += 1
        
        if count_zeros == k:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `count_zeros` is equal to the total number of zeros in `n` up to a maximum of `k`, `to_remove` is equal to the count of non-zero digits encountered before reaching `k` zeros, and `n` is still a string representation of the original non-negative integer.
    if (count_zeros == k) :
        print(to_remove)
    else :
        print(len(n) - 1)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`count_zeros` is equal to the total number of zeros in `n`, `to_remove` is the count of non-zero digits encountered before reaching `k` zeros, and `n` remains a string representation of the original non-negative integer. If `count_zeros` equals `k`, then `to_remove` has been printed. Otherwise, `count_zeros` is less than `k`, and `len(n) - 1` has been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts no parameters and reads two values from input: a non-negative integer `n` (as a string) and a positive integer `k`. It counts the number of zeros in `n` from the right until it reaches `k` zeros or there are no more zeros. If it counts exactly `k` zeros, it prints the number of non-zero digits encountered before reaching those zeros. If it encounters fewer than `k` zeros, it prints the length of `n` minus one. Edge cases include inputs with no zeros or inputs with fewer than `k` zeros, which result in different output values based on the conditions outlined.
