The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from user input, split into two string representations. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not given explicitly, but `n` is constrained as a non-negative integer from 0 to 2,000,000,000, and `k` is a positive integer from 1 to 9. Therefore, after the execution of the code, both variables now hold string representations of their values. The output state reflects these new assignments.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 2,000,000,000; `k` is a string representation of a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 9.**
