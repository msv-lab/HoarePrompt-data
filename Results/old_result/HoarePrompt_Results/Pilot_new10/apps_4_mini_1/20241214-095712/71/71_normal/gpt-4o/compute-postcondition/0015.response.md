`to_remove` is incremented by 1, while `n` remains unchanged as it is a string representation of a non-negative integer. The other information about `n` still holds, and the state of the program just reflects the increment in `to_remove`. 

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 2,000,000,000; `to_remove` is incremented by 1.**
