You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp is crazy about round numbers. He especially likes the numbers divisible by 10^{k}.

In the given number of n Polycarp wants to remove the least number of digits to get a number that is divisible by 10^{k}. For example, if k = 3, in the number 30020 it is enough to delete a single digit (2). In this case, the result is 3000 that is divisible by 10^3 = 1000.

Write a program that prints the minimum number of digits to be deleted from the given integer number n, so that the result is divisible by 10^{k}. The result should not start with the unnecessary leading zero (i.e., zero can start only the number 0, which is required to be written as exactly one digit).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integer numbers n and k (0 ≤ n ≤ 2 000 000 000, 1 ≤ k ≤ 9).

It is guaranteed that the answer exists. All numbers in the input are written in traditional notation of integers, that is, without any extra leading zeros.


-----Output-----

Print w — the required minimal number of digits to erase. After removing the appropriate w digits from the number n, the result should have a value that is divisible by 10^{k}. The result can start with digit 0 in the single case (the result is zero and written by exactly the only digit 0).


-----Examples-----
Input
30020 3

Output
1

Input
100 9

Output
2

Input
10203049 2

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the example 2 you can remove two digits: 1 and any 0. The result is number 0 which is divisible by any number.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        n //= 10
    print(w)


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the given program in relation to the problem description, let's first summarize the requirements:

The program needs to find the minimal number of digits to delete from an integer `n` such that the remaining number is divisible by \(10^k\), while making sure the resulting number doesn't have unnecessary leading zeros (except for the case of the number being zero).

Now, let's break down the provided code:

```python
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    w = 0
    while n % 10 ** k != 0:
        w += 1
        n //= 10
    print(w)
```

### Analysis of the Code:

1. The input consists of two integers: `n` and `k`.
2. The algorithm counts the number of times it can truncate the last digit of `n` until `n` becomes divisible by \(10^k\).
3. Each iteration of the `while` loop increments the counter `w`, which represents the number of deleted digits.
4. Finally, it prints the count `w`.

### Potential Issues:

1. **Handling of Leading Zeros**: The code currently does not check if the resultant number after removals leads to a scenario where it starts with unnecessary zeros. For example, if `n = 123450` and `k = 3`, the correct output should consider the remaining number must not start with a zero unless the result is zero itself.

2. **Edge Case - Large k**: If `k` is larger than the number of zeros present at the end of `n`, the program may result in deleting necessary digits without achieving the desired divisibility by \(10^k\).

3. **Output for Zero**: As per the problem, the output should consider that if we can make `n = 0` validly (like removing all digits), it needs to allow a final output of `0` without leading zeros or extra deletions.

### Testing Potential Cases:

Let’s create a test case that captures some of the above issues:

- **Case 1**: For `n = 100200` and `k = 3`, the program will run and remove digits to try making it divisible by 1000.
- The correct answer should ideally lead us to the outcome `200`, respecting leading zeros when not at the beginning if there's more than one zero left - but this program wouldn't correctly handle or validate leading zero conditions.

### Conclusion:

The program has logical flaws and will not correctly handle all specified conditions, especially concerning output validity regarding leading zeros and optimal deletions.

Thus, the final conclusion regarding the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two parameters: a non-negative integer `n` (between 0 and 2,000,000,000 inclusive) and a positive integer `k` (between 1 and 9 inclusive). It counts the number of digits that need to be removed from the right end of `n` until `n` becomes divisible by `10^k`, and it prints this count. If `n` is already divisible by `10^k` at the start, it returns 0 without removing any digits. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
