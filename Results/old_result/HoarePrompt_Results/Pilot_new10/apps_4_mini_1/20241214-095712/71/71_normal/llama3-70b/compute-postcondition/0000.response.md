The values of `n` and `k` are assigned new values from the input, accepted as integers through the `input().split()` function and mapped to `n` and `k`. The initial conditions state that `n` can be any non-negative integer between 0 and 2,000,000,000 inclusive, and `k` can be any positive integer between 1 and 9 inclusive. After executing the code, the specific values of `n` and `k` will change based on the user's input.

Since the exact values from the input are not provided, we can only express them as their respective input variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 0 and 2,000,000,000 inclusive; `k` is an input integer between 1 and 9 inclusive.**
