Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `g` is the index of the last occurrence of 'G' in the string `s` or -1 if 'G' does not occur, `t` is the index of the last occurrence of 'T' in the string `s` or -1 if 'T' does not occur, `s` is the input string. If either `g` or `t` is -1, the string 'NO' has been printed. Otherwise, if both `g` and `t` are valid indices, the output 'YES' is printed if the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is divisible by `k` and all indices from `g` to `t` with a step of `k` contain elements in string `s` that are not equal to '#'. If the conditions for printing 'YES' are not met, the output 'NO' is printed.***
