To determine the correctness of the annotated program based on the problem description, let's analyze the key requirements and the corresponding functionality of the program.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. The program needs to determine if a grasshopper ('G') can reach a target insect ('T') by making jumps of exactly `k` cells in either direction (left or right) on a string where:
    - '.' represents empty cells
    - '#' represents obstacles
2. The grasshopper can jump over obstacles; however, it cannot land on them.
3. The input guarantees that 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once.

### Annotated Program's Flow:
1. The program reads `n` (length of the line) and `k` (jump length).
2. It initializes indices `g` and `t` to locate positions of 'G' and 'T'.
3. The program checks for the presence of 'G' and 'T'. If either is not found (which should not happen according to the problem description), it prints "NO".
4. It checks if the absolute difference between indices `t` and `g` is divisible by `k` (which allows for a valid jump sequence).
5. The program uses a generator within `all()` to check if all cells that the grasshopper would land on (if it were making jumps of `k`) do not contain obstacles ('#').
6. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Key Points of Functionality:
- **Jump Calculation**: The program correctly checks whether the distance between 'G' and 'T' is a multiple of `k`, which is essential for the grasshopper to reach the target.
- **Obstacle Check**: The program ensures the grasshopper does not end up on an obstacle by checking each landing position within the allowed range.
- **Guaranteed Input**: The program assumes 'G' and 'T' will be present according to the problem description, disregarding checks that would print "NO".

### Evaluation Against Edge Cases:
- Given the inputs as guaranteed by the problem, it effectively handles cases where:
   - There are obstacles before or after 'G' and 'T' that wouldn't interfere as long as the landing cells remain obstacle-free.
   - Inputs where 'G' and 'T' are adjacent or far apart, corresponding behavior aligns with described functionality.

### Conclusion:
The program implements the logic necessary to fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem's description. It evaluates possible jumps based on modular arithmetic correctly and ensures that jumps do not land on obstacles.

Therefore, the program adheres strictly to the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **True**
