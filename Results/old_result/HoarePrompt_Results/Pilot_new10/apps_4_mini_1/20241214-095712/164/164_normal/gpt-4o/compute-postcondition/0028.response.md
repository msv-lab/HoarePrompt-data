To analyze the final output state after all iterations of the loop have completed, let's consider the conditions required for the loop execution and the implications of reaching the loop's termination points.

The loop iterates from `G_pos` to `T_pos` in steps of `k`. Here are the derived conclusions:

1. **Initial Conditions**: 
   - `n` is limited between 2 and 100.
   - `k` is at least 1 and at most `n - 1`, ensuring that the range for `pos` could at most reach `T_pos` without skipping.
   - `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos` for the loop to execute.
   - The loop will break either if a `'#'` is encountered in `line` or if `pos` equals `T_pos`.

2. **Output State Analysis**: 
   - If the loop executes to completion without breaking due to encountering a `'#'`, `reachable` will be `True`, since `pos` will have equaled `T_pos`.
   - If the loop encounters a `'#'` before reaching `T_pos`, `reachable` remains `False`.
   - The final value of `pos` after all iterations will be such that it either has reached `T_pos` or the last valid value before breaking.

Based on these conditions:

Output State: **`n` is an integer (2 ≤ n ≤ 100), `k` is an integer (1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1), `line` is a string, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is True if `pos` equals `T_pos` after the loop finishes, `pos` is the last position reached in the loop, which must be between `G_pos` and `T_pos`, inclusive. If the loop does not execute, `reachable` is False and `pos` is not defined.**
