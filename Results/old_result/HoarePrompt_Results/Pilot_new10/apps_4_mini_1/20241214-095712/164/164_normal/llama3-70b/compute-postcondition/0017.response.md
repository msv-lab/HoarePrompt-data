`g` is assigned the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 2, so `g` becomes 2. The value of `n` remains an integer between 2 and 100, and `i` also remains 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, and `g` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 2, `g` is 2**
