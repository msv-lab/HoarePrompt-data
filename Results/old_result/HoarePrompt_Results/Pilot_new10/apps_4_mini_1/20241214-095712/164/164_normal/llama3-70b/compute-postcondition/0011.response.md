According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop iterates while `i` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer between 2 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, `i` will become 1.

Since `s[i]` is being evaluated in the loop body, `s[i]` will be `s[1]`. If `s[1]` is 'G', then `g` is set to 0. If `s[1]` is 'T', then `t` is set to 0.

Therefore, after the next iteration, `i` needs to be 1, and `s[i]` must be considered to determine the state of `g` or `t` based on its value. 

So, the modified state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `i` is 1, if `s[1]` is 'G' then `g` is set to 0; otherwise, if `s[1]` is not 'G' and is equal to 'T', then `t` is set to 0.**
