Correctness: **False**

The program has an issue with the logic where it assumes that the grasshopper can only jump to the right. It determines the positions of 'G' and 'T', and if 'G' is to the right of 'T', it swaps them. This means that the program only checks the path from 'G' to 'T' in one direction (from left to right), which fails to account for cases when 'T' is left of 'G'.

For example, consider the input case:
```
5 2
#TG#.
```
In this case:
- 'G' is at position 1
- 'T' is at position 2

Before reaching 'T', the program will try to check positions:
- Starts at G_pos (1), but the next jump of size k (2) would bring it to position 3, which is blocked by '#', and the program would incorrectly determine that 'T' is unreachable.

However, the grasshopper can just jump from position 1 (G) to position 2 (T), but since the program does not account for backward jumps, it fails to report the correct output. Thus, the program does not meet the correctness requirements as outlined in the problem description.
