You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the program, let's analyze the provided implementation against the problem description. 

The requirements state that we need to determine the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters from sets of positions in the string, ensuring that these positions are not separated by any uppercase letters.

### Review of the Code:

1. **Input Reading**:
   The program correctly reads an integer `n` and the string `s`.

2. **Logic for Counting Lowercase Letters**:
   - It initializes `max_count`, `current_set`, and `current_count`.
   - As it iterates through the string, it checks if a character is lowercase. If so, and if it hasn't been seen before (`if char not in current_set:`), it adds the character to the `current_set` and increments `current_count`.

3. **Handling Uppercase Letters**:
   - When an uppercase letter is encountered, the maximum count so far is updated with `max_count = max(max_count, current_count)`, and the current counts are reset.

4. **Final Count Update**: 
   - Finally, after the loop, it ensures the last count is considered with `max_count = max(max_count, current_count)`.

5. **Output**: 
   - It prints the maximum count.

### Testing for Edge Cases:

Let's consider a few edge cases:

1. **All Lowercase Letters**:
   Input: 
   ```
   5
  abcde
   ```
   Expected Output: `5` 
   The program should return `5`, as all letters are lowercase.

2. **Adjacent Lowercase with Uppercase Separator**:
   Input:
   ```
   11
  abEcdFfgh
   ```
   Expected Output: `5` 
   The program should count `a`, `b`, `c`, `d`, `f`, `g`, and `h`. The characters `e` and `D` should be excluded since uppercase letters separate them.

3. **Various Uppercase Letters**:
   Input: 
   ```
   6
  AaaaaA
   ```
   Expected Output: `1`
   Here, it should return `1`, since only `a` counts, and it is surrounded by uppercase letters.

4. **Empty Input** or **No Lowercase Letters**:
   Input for empty condition:
   ```
   3
  ABC
   ```
   Expected Output: `0`
   The program should return `0`, correctly identifying that no lowercase letters are present.

### A Found Case Where the Program Fails:

- **Non-Sequential Uppercase Letters**:
Input: 
```
9
AbcDabcE
```
- Expected Output: `3` (positions 2, 3, 5 or 6).
- However, the program generates `2` (it counts `a`, `b` from the first block before the first capital, resets, and only counts the first occurrence of `a`, `b`, then does not count `c` from the second block effectively leaving it with `2` for total).

### Conclusion:

The program fails because it does not correctly track distinct lowercase letters in non-contiguous sequences caused by multiple uppercase letters that break the counting. Thus, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) representing the length of string s, and s is a string consisting only of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is the input string consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, `max_count` is the maximum count of unique lowercase letters found in any segment of `s`, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0 if the last character was uppercase, or the number of unique lowercase letters in the final segment of `s` if the last character was lowercase.
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Based on the annotated version of the code  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the annotated version provides a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
