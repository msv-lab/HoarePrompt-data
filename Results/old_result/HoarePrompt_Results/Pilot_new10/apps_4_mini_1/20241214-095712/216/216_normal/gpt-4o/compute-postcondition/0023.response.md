Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. If `char` is a lowercase letter, `current_set` includes `char` and any previously included characters, `current_count` is incremented to 2 unless `char` was already in `current_set` (in which case they remain unchanged), and `max_count` remains 0 when the loop executes again. Otherwise, if `char` is not a lowercase letter, `current_set` is empty, `current_count` is 0, and `max_count` is either 0 or 1.***
