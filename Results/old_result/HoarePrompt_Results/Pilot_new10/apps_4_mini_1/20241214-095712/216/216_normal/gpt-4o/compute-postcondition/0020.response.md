The `max_count` variable is assigned the maximum value between its current value and the `current_count`. The value of `max_count` can either remain the same or change to `current_count`, which is currently 1. Since `max_count` remains 0 before this operation, the possible values after execution will be either 0 or 1. The other variables (`n`, `s`, `char`, `current_set`, `current_count`) are not modified by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `current_set` includes `char`, `current_count` is 1, `max_count` is either 0 or 1.**
