`max_count` is assigned the value of the maximum between `max_count` and `current_count`. Since `max_count` is initially 0 and `current_count` is also 0, the maximum value remains 0. Therefore, the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is an empty set, `current_count` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s`, and `char` is an uppercase letter.**
