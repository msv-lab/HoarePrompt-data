The program processes a string `s` to find the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters in contiguous segments bounded by uppercase letters. It reads an integer `n` representing the length of the string and the string `s` itself.

The function maintains:
- `current_set` to store uniquely encountered lowercase letters in the current segment.
- `current_count` to count the distinct lowercase letters encountered in the current segment.
- `max_count` to store the maximum count of distinct lowercase letters across all segments.

The program iterates through each character in the string:
1. If the character is lowercase and not already in `current_set`, it adds it to the set and increments `current_count`.
2. If an uppercase character is encountered, it updates `max_count` with the current count of unique lowercase letters, clears the `current_set`, and resets `current_count` to zero to start counting a new segment.
3. After the loop, it ensures that `max_count` is updated for the last segment if it ends with lowercase letters.

The function ultimately prints the maximum count of distinct lowercase letters found in any "pretty" segment of the string.

### Correctness Analysis:
- The program correctly identifies segments of lowercase letters that are not interrupted by uppercase letters.
- The use of a set ensures that only distinct lowercase letters are counted.
- It correctly updates `max_count` whenever an uppercase letter (segment boundary) is encountered and also checks the last segment.
- It handles all edge cases: if there are no lowercase letters it will output `0`, and if all letters are lowercase it will count all of them accurately.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to find the maximum number of unique lowercase letters in "pretty" segments of the string, conforming to the problem description. 

Correctness: **True**
