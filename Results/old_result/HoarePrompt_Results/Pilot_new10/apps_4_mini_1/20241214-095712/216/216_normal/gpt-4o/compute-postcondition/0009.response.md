The value of `current_count` is incremented by 1. The initial state indicates that `current_count` was originally 0, so its new value will be 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is a set containing `char`, `current_count` is 1, and `char` is the first character in `s`, which is a lowercase letter.
