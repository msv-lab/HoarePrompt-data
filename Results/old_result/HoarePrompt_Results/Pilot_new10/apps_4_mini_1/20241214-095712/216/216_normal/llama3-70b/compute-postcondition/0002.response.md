The code creates a list called `lowercase` that contains the indices of characters in the string `s` that are lowercase. The value of `n` determines the length of the string `s`. However, since the previous values of `s` and `lowercase` depend on the input `n` and the content of `s`, we can state that `lowercase` will contain indices based on `s`.

The state of other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `s` is a string consisting of only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with a length equal to `n`; `lowercase` contains the indices of the lowercase letters in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `s` is a string consisting of only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with a length equal to `n`; `lowercase` contains the indices of the lowercase letters in `s`.**
