The variable `current_count` is assigned the value `0`. Since it was previously `0`, it remains unchanged. The states of the other variables do not change as a result of this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, `max_count` is 0, `current_set` is still an empty set, `current_count` is 0, `char` is the first character in `s`, and `char` is an uppercase letter.
