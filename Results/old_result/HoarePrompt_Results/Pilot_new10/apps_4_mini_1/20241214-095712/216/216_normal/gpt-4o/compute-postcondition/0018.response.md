`current_count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `current_count` was 1, so after the increment, the new value is 2. Other variables remain unchanged and valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters, `char` is the next character in the string `s`, `current_set` includes `char` (and the previously included characters), `current_count` is 2, `max_count` remains 0 when the loop executes again.
