Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), `s` is a non-empty string consisting of uppercase and lowercase Latin letters. If `char` is a lowercase letter, then `current_set` includes `char`, `current_count` is 1, and `max_count` remains 0. If `char` is an uppercase letter, then `current_set` remains empty, `current_count` is 0, and `max_count` is still 0.***
