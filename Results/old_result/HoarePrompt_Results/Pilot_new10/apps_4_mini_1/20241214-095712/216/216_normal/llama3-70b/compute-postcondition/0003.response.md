`len(lowercase)` returns the number of elements in the list `lowercase`, which contains the indices of lowercase letters in the string `s`. The value of `lowercase` is determined by the previously defined string `s` of length `n`, which is an input integer ranging from 1 to 200. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 1 ≤ n ≤ 200; `s` is a string consisting of only lowercase and uppercase Latin letters with a length equal to `n`; `lowercase` contains the indices of the lowercase letters in `s`; the length of `lowercase` has been printed.**
