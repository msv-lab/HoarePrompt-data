You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for (i, c) in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    print(len(lowercase))


```
Original Assessment: To determine if the provided Python code meets the requirements stated in the problem description, we need to critically evaluate how the program processes input strings.

### Problem Overview
The objective is to identify a "pretty set" of positions in a string composed of lowercase and uppercase letters. The rules for a "pretty set" are:
1. All letters at the given positions must be distinct and lowercase.
2. There should not be any uppercase letters present between the selected positions in the set.

### Provided Code
The program provided:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    lowercase = [i for (i, c) in enumerate(s) if c.islower()]
    print(len(lowercase))
```

### Analysis of the Code
1. **Input Handling**: It takes an integer `n`, then reads the string `s`.
2. **Finding Lowercase Letters**: It creates a list called `lowercase` that contains the indices of all lowercase letters in `s`.
3. **Output**: It prints the length of the `lowercase` list.

### Correctness Evaluation
The program does contain a significant logical flaw:
- It only counts the number of lowercase letters regardless of the uppercase letters separating them. This violates the second condition of a "pretty set".

### Potential Test Cases
1. **Test Case with Uppercase Letters Interrupting**:
   - Input: 
     ```
     5
     aAbCc
     ```
   - Expected Output: `1` (only `a` is a valid position; `b` and `c` are not distinct without uppercase letters interrupting).
   - Actual Output: The program outputs `3`, counting all lowercase letters, which is incorrect.

2. **Test Case with No Lowercase Letters**:
   - Input: 
     ```
     3
     ABC
     ```
   - Expected Output: `0` (no lowercase letters).
   - Actual Output: The program outputs `0`, which is correct for this case.

3. **Test Case with Distinct Lowercase Characters Separated by Uppercase**:
   - Input:
     ```
     11
     aBcdEfghI
     ```
   - Expected Output: `4` (valid lowercase characters are 'a', 'c', 'd', 'g', which are distinct).
   - Actual Output: The program outputs `7`, incorrectly counting the total lowercase instead of checking for separation.

### Conclusion
The program fails in cases where uppercase letters disrupt the sequence of lowercase letters, leading to incorrect counting of positions.

### Final Decision
Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it does not appropriately handle input cases where uppercase letters are present between lowercase letters, thus failing to produce the required output.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) and a string `s` that is expected to be of length `n`, consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters. It calculates the number of lowercase letters in the string `s` and prints this count. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
