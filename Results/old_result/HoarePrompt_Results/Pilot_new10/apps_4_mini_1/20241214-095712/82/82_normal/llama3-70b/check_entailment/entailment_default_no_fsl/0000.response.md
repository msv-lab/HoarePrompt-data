Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not correctly handle the logic to find the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a+k \) and \( b+k \) is minimized. 

Based on the provided code, the while loop increments \( k \) and continues as long as the current LCM (calculated by `func_2(a + k, b + k)`) is less than the previously found minimum LCM. However, the code prints `k - 1`, which means it outputs the last value of \( k \) that produced a smaller LCM, instead of the smallest \( k \) that achieved the minimum LCM.

A critical issue arises because once the loop breaks, the last valid \( k \) is `k - 1` but may not correspond to the smallest \( k \) with the minimum LCM. For example, when \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 9 \), the program's logic may lead to skipped values of \( k \) that yield the same minimum LCM, resulting in incorrect output.

Additionally, the calculation of LCM relies on using the GCD from `func_1`, which is acceptable, but the algorithmic approach to iterating through potential values of \( k \) is flawed. 

In conclusion, the code does not satisfy the requirements for determining the smallest \( k \) that yields the minimum LCM correctly in every case. An example case that illustrates this point is given by the input \( a = 6 \) and \( b = 10 \), which should give \( k = 2 \), however, the logic may not output 2 correctly in all cases because it increments incorrectly based on the loop condition and indexed value of \( k \).
