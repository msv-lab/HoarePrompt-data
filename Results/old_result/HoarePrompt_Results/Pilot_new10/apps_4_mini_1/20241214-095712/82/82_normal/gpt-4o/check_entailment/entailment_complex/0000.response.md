To evaluate the correctness of the provided code against the problem description, let's analyze how the code behaves, paying attention to the logic and conditions specified.

### Code Overview
The code defines three functions:
1. `func_1(x, y)`: Computes the GCD (Greatest Common Divisor) of two numbers `x` and `y`.
2. `func_2(x, y)`: Computes the Least Common Multiple (LCM) using the GCD computed by `func_1`.
3. `func_3(a, b)`: Main functionality that seeks to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the LCM of `a + k` and `b + k` is minimized.

### Code Logic Breakdown
- In `func_3`, if `a` and `b` are equal, it immediately returns `0`. This is a special case where the minimum LCM is trivially reached since both numbers are the same.
- If `a` and `b` are not equal, it calculates the difference `diff = abs(a - b)`.
- Then, it iterates through possible divisors of `diff` to find candidate values for `k`:
  - For each divisor `k`, it calculates `new_a` and `new_b`, which are the next multiples of `k` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively.
  - It then calculates the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`.
  - The minimum LCM found and its associated `k` are stored and potentially updated.

### Key Considerations
- The potential values for `k` are derived only from the divisors of `diff`, meaning it may miss other values that could yield a smaller LCM.
- Particularly, based on mathematical properties, it's possible for some values of `k` (which are not divisors of `diff`) to yield a lower LCM. The condition where only divisors of `diff` are considered could miss certain optimal cases.

### Examples Analysis
Let's consider the provided examples:
1. For input `6 10`, the expected output is `2`. The calculation of LCM for candidates involving the divisors of `4` (i.e., `1`, `2`, `4`) leads correctly to `2`.
2. For input `21 31`, the expected output is `9`. It follows the same logic by checking divisors.
3. For input `5 10`, the expected output `0` is returned correctly when both numbers are not equal but share factors.

### Missing Edge Case
A missing edge case is clear:
- If `a = 3, b = 4`, checking `k`, regardless of the divisor of `1` and other simple forms could yield a better result for `k=1`, but might miss it because of limited divisor checks.

### Conclusion
Due to the algorithmâ€™s reliance solely on the divisors of `diff`, certain values of `k` that are not divisors may lead to a lower LCM. Hence, the code does not fully comply with the problem statement for all cases, as it cannot guarantee finding the minimum for every pair of integers.

The program does not work as expected in some scenarios, particularly those where an appropriate `k` is not a divisor of the difference between `a` and `b`.

Correctness: **False**.
