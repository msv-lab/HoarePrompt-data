You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Neko loves divisors. During the latest number theory lesson, he got an interesting exercise from his math teacher.

Neko has two integers $a$ and $b$. His goal is to find a non-negative integer $k$ such that the least common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible. If there are multiple optimal integers $k$, he needs to choose the smallest one.

Given his mathematical talent, Neko had no trouble getting Wrong Answer on this problem. Can you help him solve it?


-----Input-----

The only line contains two integers $a$ and $b$ ($1 \le a, b \le 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Print the smallest non-negative integer $k$ ($k \ge 0$) such that the lowest common multiple of $a+k$ and $b+k$ is the smallest possible.

If there are many possible integers $k$ giving the same value of the least common multiple, print the smallest one.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 10

Output
2
Input
21 31

Output
9
Input
5 10

Output
0


-----Note-----

In the first test, one should choose $k = 2$, as the least common multiple of $6 + 2$ and $10 + 2$ is $24$, which is the smallest least common multiple possible.
Program:
```
import math

(a, b) = map(int, input().split())
k = 0
min_lcm = func_2(a, b)
while True:
    if func_2(a + k, b + k) < min_lcm:
        min_lcm = func_2(a + k, b + k)
    else:
        break
    k += 1
print(k - 1)

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

def func_2(a, b):
    return a * b // func_1(a, b)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we start by analyzing how the program determines the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads integers \( a \) and \( b \) from input.
  
2. **Initial Variables**: 
   - `k` is initialized to 0.
   - `min_lcm` is initialized to the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \) using the `func_2` function.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The program continues to loop, incrementing \( k \), and calculates the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \).
   - If the new LCM is smaller than `min_lcm`, it updates `min_lcm`.
   - If not, it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**: The final result is printed as `k - 1`.

### Potential Issues

1. **Incorrect k Output**: 
   - The output is calculated as `k - 1`, which is problematic. This would be incorrect when the minimal LCM occurs at \( k = 0 \). It results in an output of -1, which is invalid since \( k \) should be a non-negative integer.

2. **Termination Condition**: 
   - The program may prematurely exit when it finds a LCM that is not smaller than `min_lcm`. Thus, it might miss smaller potential \( k \) values that could yield the same minimal LCM but later in the iteration.

3. **Complexity**:
   - The algorithm can potentially loop indefinitely if there are non-increasing sequences of LCM values with constant minima due to improper boundary checks for `k`.

### Example Where Program Fails
Consider \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \):
- \( k = 0 \): LCM(1, 2) = 2.
- \( k = 1 \): LCM(2, 3) = 6.
- \( k = 2 \): LCM(3, 4) = 12.
- The program will find that \( k = 0 \) yields the smallest LCM.
- The program will then output \( k - 1 = -1 \), which is invalid.

### Conclusion
Given these issues, specifically the incorrect output when \( k = 0 \) leads to a result of -1, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. It continues to loop until `b` becomes 0, at which point it returns `a` as the GCD. The function handles the input values constrained between 1 and \(10^9\) and correctly computes the GCD according to the Euclidean algorithm. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the result of multiplying `a` by `b` and then dividing by the output of `func_1(a, b)`. Since the exact behavior of `func_1` is unknown based on this snippet, potential edge cases such as division by zero cannot be determined. If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, the function would encounter a runtime error. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
