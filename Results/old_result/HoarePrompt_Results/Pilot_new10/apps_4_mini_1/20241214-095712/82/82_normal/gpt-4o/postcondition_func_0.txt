The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function employs the Euclidean algorithm, which iteratively replaces `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0, at which point `x` holds the GCD. No edge cases are ignored, as the algorithm functions correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range of 1 to 10^9.
