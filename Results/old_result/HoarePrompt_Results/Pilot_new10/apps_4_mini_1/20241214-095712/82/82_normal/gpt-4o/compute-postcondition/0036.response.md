In the given code, `current_lcm` is assigned the result of the function `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. The previous values of `new_a` and `new_b` will affect the value of `current_lcm`, but since their specific values are not provided or calculated from the initial state, `current_lcm` will remain undefined until we execute `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

The variables that remain unchanged include `a`, `b`, `diff`, `min_lcm`, `current_k`, and `k`, as they are not modified by this line of code. 

Therefore, we will represent the output state without specific value calculations of `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` because of their dependency on function execution:

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` holds the minimum least common multiple calculated from the candidates, `current_k` is at least 1, `k` can take values from `current_k` up to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `current_k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
