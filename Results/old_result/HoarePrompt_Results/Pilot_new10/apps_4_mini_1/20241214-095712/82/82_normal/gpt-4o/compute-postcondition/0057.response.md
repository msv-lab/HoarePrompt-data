In this loop, the variable `k` is used to iterate over potential divisors of `diff`, starting from 1 up to the integer value of the square root of `diff`. The loop increments `k` by 1 with each iteration.

At the end of the previous iteration, the value of `k` would have been some integer less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new value for `k` would be `previous_k + 1`.

Additionally, we need to ensure that `k` does not exceed `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. As `k` is incremented, we also need to confirm that `diff` remains a consistent state based on `a` and `b`.

Therefore, if `diff` is unchanged, and `k` is adjusted to be `previous_k + 1`, then the state will require that `k` still falls within the valid range for the loop to continue executing.

Thus, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `k` is `previous_k + 1`, which must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`**
