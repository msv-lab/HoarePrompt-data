According to the code, the for loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is set to 1 and `diff` is a positive integer. This means that the current state of `candidate` will take the value of `k` first, and then it will take the value of `diff // k`.

If the previous iteration processed the first value of `candidate`, which is `1`, we should expect the loop to execute again with the next value from the list, which is `diff // k`. 

To prepare for the next iteration:
1. The first value of `candidate` was `k`, which is 1. Upon completion, the loop moves to the next element in the array.
2. The next value of `candidate` is `diff // k`. Since `k` is currently 1, this value is simply `diff`.

Thus, to execute one more time, we set `candidate` to `diff`.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `k` is set to 1, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_k` is equal to `candidate`, `candidate` is `diff // 1` (which is `diff`)**
