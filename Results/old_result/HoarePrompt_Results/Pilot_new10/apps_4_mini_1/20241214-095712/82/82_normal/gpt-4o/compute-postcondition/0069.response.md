To simulate the execution of the provided code snippet, let's analyze the initial state and understand the implications of the operation:

1. **Initial Conditions**:
   - `a` and `b` are positive integers.
   - `diff` is defined as `abs(a - b)`.
   - `next multiple of candidate` means that `new_b` will be modified based on the variable `candidate`, which is `diff // k`.
   - `new_a` is computed based on the given formula, and depends on `a`, `b`, and `k`.
   - The function `func_2(new_a, new_b)` returns a value that is assigned to `current_lcm`.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - When the code `current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)` is executed, the variables `new_a` and `new_b` are utilized to compute `current_lcm`. Thus, while the variables are not directly changed by this line, the output variable `current_lcm` is assigned a new value which is based on the function `func_2` using the possibly updated values of `new_a` and `new_b`.

3. **Output State Variables**:
   - Since `current_lcm` is assigned a new value based on the execution of `func_2`, it will contain the output of this function. However, without specifics on the function or changes to `new_a` and `new_b` in this context, we maintain their earlier calculations.

Hence, the output state maintains all initial conditions while adding the assignment of `current_lcm` based on the function output:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers; `diff` is `abs(a - b)`; `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions; `new_a` is computed as `(a + (abs(a - b) // k) - 1) // (abs(a - b) // k) * (abs(a - b) // k)`; `new_b` is the next multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`; `current_lcm` is the output of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.**
