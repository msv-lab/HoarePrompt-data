According to the code, the loop iterates over values of `k` starting from 1 up to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. The loop will execute for each integer value of `k` within this range. At the end of the last iteration, `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`, and the loop currently executed for the value of `k` equal to some integer (let's denote it as `current_k`). 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to increment `k` by 1. Therefore, if the last value of `k` was `current_k`, the next value of `k` will be `current_k + 1`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `k` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `current_k + 1` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`.

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is the positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` holds the minimum least common multiple calculated from the candidates, `current_k` is the next integer value for `k` which is `current_k + 1`, and `k` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(diff))`**.
