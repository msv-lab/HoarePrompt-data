Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, and `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions. If `diff % k == 0`, the least common multiple `min_lcm` of the computed `new_a` and `new_b` is determined for candidates evaluated, and `min_k` is the smallest candidate that produced this minimum least common multiple. If the condition is not satisfied and the loop does not execute, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged from their initial values.***
