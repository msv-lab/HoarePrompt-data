Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions, `new_a` is computed as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is the next multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` is the output of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is updated to `candidate`.***
