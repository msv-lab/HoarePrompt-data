Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm` and `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate` if `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`.***
