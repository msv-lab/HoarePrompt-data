The code assigns a new value to `new_b`, which is computed based on the previous value of `b` and `candidate`. The variable `candidate` is defined as `diff // k`, and `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, which implies that `candidate` has a defined value derived from `a`, `b`, and `k`. The impact on the state includes the recalculation of `new_b` based on its algebraic expression.

Therefore, the output state will include the updated value of `new_b`, while preserving the existing values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`, `candidate`, and `new_a`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `current_lcm` is assigned the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_a` is equal to `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is equal to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.**
