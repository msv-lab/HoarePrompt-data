Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `k` is set to 1, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, and `min_k` is equal to `candidate` if `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or if `current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`.***
