#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers where 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    while y:
        x, y = y, x % y
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: 'y' is 0, 'x' is the GCD of the original values of 'x' and 'y'
    return x
    #The program returns x, which is the GCD of the original values of x and y, where y is 0. Therefore, it essentially returns x, as the GCD of any number and 0 is the number itself.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `x` and `y`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `x` and `y`. The function employs the Euclidean algorithm, which iteratively replaces `x` and `y` until `y` becomes 0, at which point `x` holds the GCD. No edge cases are ignored, as the algorithm functions correctly for all valid inputs within the specified range of 1 to 10^9.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x, y <= 10^9.
def func_2(x, y):
    return x * y // func_1(x, y)
    #The program returns the result of the expression x * y divided by func_1(x, y), where x and y are positive integers between 1 and 10^9.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters, x and y (where 1 <= x, y <= 10^9), and returns the result of the expression x * y divided by the output of func_1(x, y). It is important to note that if func_1(x, y) returns zero, this would cause a division by zero error, which is not explicitly handled in the code provided. Thus, the functionality includes returning the result of the expression or encountering a division by zero error if func_1(x, y) is zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9.
def func_3(a, b):

        #The program returns 0, indicating that the values of `a` and `b`, although equal, do not affect the return value, which is a constant of 0.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^9, and `a` is not equal to `b`.

        if diff % k == 0:
            for candidate in [k, diff // k]:
                new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
                current_lcm = func_2(new_a, new_b)

                    min_k):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is equal to `abs(a - b)`, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple obtained from valid candidates or `float('inf')` if no candidates were evaluated, and `min_k` is the candidate associated with `min_lcm` or 0 if no candidates were considered.
    return min_k
    #The program returns min_k, which is the candidate associated with the minimum least common multiple, or 0 if no candidates were considered.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b` and returns 0 if they are equal; otherwise, it returns the candidate associated with the minimum least common multiple of modified `a` and `b`, or 0 if no valid candidates are considered.
