To assess the correctness of the provided Python program with respect to the problem description, I will analyze the program's logic and its implementation against the requirements.

### Problem Description Summary:
Neko needs to find a non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized. If there are multiple \( k \) values yielding the same minimum LCM, the smallest \( k \) should be chosen.

### Key Steps in the Annotated Program:
1. **Calculation of GCD**: `func_1` computes the GCD of two numbers, which is utilized to compute the LCM in `func_2`.
  
2. **LCM Calculation**: `func_2` returns the LCM of two integers using the relationship \( LCM(x, y) = \frac{x \cdot y}{GCD(x, y)} \).

3. **Main Logic in `func_3`**:
    - If \( a \) and \( b \) are equal, the function immediately returns 0 since \( LCM(a + k, b + k) \) is minimized at \( k = 0 \).
    - It calculates the absolute difference \( diff = |a - b| \).
    - It iterates through potential divisors of \( diff \) (up to the square root of \( diff \)).
    - For each candidate divisor \( k \), it computes the new values of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) that are the smallest multiples of the candidate divisor greater than or equal to \( a \) and \( b \).

4. **Finding the Minimum**: It keeps track of the minimum LCM found and updates \( min_k \) whenever a new smaller LCM is identified.

### Correctness Assessment:
- The program effectively implements the logic required to find the optimal \( k \).
- It handles the base case when \( a = b \) correctly.
- The loop covering divisors directly relates to how LCM can be manipulated via multiples, leading to candidate values of \( k \).
- The updating conditions are correctly set to ensure both the minimum LCM and the smallest \( k \) are maintained.

### Edge Cases:
1. **When \( a \) equals \( b \)**: The program returns 0, which is correct and efficient.
2. **Large Values**: The code iterates only up to \( \sqrt{diff} \), ensuring performance is manageable within the constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the problem description and correctly finds the smallest \( k \) that minimizes the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \). It handles various scenarios and edge cases appropriately.

Thus, the final result is:

Correctness: **True**
