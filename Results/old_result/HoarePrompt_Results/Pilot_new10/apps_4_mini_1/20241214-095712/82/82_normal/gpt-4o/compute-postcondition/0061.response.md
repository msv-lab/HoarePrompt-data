To analyze the state after executing the provided code snippet, we can observe that the function `func_2` is called with `new_a` and `new_b` as arguments. Here is how the variables are affected:

- `new_a` is already defined as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, which computes the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.
- `new_b` is defined as the next multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`.

The output will contain the updated state of the variable `current_lcm`, as it will hold the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, but since we do not know the implementation of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact value it computes. However, we understand that `current_lcm` will be defined based on `new_a` and `new_b`.

Since none of the other variables (`a`, `b`, `diff`, or `previous_k`) are modified directly by this line of code, we retain their values.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `previous_k` satisfies the conditions given, `new_a` is computed as `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is the next multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` is the output of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**.
