The value of `new_b` is assigned the next multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`. The value of `candidate` is `diff // k`, which is the absolute difference between `a` and `b` divided by `k`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is non-negative, thus `candidate` is non-negative as well. The specific value of `new_b` can be deduced from the formula applied as it rounds up `b` to the nearest multiple of `candidate`.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State would be: `a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions, `new_a` is computed as `(a + (abs(a - b) // k) - 1) // (abs(a - b) // k) * (abs(a - b) // k)`, `current_lcm` is the output of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `candidate` is `diff // k`, and `new_b` is computed as some multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions, `new_a` is computed as `(a + (abs(a - b) // k) - 1) // (abs(a - b) // k) * (abs(a - b) // k)`, `current_lcm` is the output of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `candidate` is `diff // k`, `new_b` is the next multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `b`.**
