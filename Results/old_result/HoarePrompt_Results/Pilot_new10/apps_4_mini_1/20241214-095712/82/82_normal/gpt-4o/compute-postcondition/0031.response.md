Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is the positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`, and `min_lcm` holds the minimum least common multiple calculated from the candidates. If `diff` is divisible by `k`, which is 1, then `new_a` and `new_b` are calculated based on either the initial `k` or `diff // k`, `min_k` is set to the candidate that resulted in the minimum `min_lcm`, and `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` based on the candidates processed in the loop.***
