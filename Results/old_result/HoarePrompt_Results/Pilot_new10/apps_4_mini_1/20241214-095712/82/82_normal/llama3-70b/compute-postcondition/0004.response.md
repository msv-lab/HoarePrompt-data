According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is `a_initial % b_initial`, which is not equal to 0. This indicates that `b` is indeed non-zero and the loop can execute one more time without any adjustments needed. 

State: **`a` is `b_initial`, `b` is `a_initial % b_initial` (not equal to 0)**
