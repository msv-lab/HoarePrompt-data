The value of `min_k` is assigned the value of `candidate`. The previous state indicates that `candidate` is equal to `diff // k`, where `diff` is `abs(a - b)`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers; `diff` is `abs(a - b)`; `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions; `candidate` is `diff // k`; `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`; `current_lcm` has been assigned the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`; `min_lcm` is equal to `current_lcm`; `min_k` is equal to `candidate`.**
