Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is `abs(a - b)`, `previous_k` satisfies the specified conditions, `min_lcm` is the least common multiple of the computed `new_a` and `new_b` for all candidates evaluated, `min_k` is the smallest candidate that produced the minimum least common multiple. If the loop does not execute, `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged from their initial values.**
