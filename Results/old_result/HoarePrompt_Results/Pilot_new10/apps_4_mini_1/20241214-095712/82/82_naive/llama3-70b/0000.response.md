To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we start by analyzing how the program determines the smallest non-negative integer \( k \) such that the least common multiple (LCM) of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \) is minimized.

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Input Reading**: The program correctly reads integers \( a \) and \( b \) from input.
  
2. **Initial Variables**: 
   - `k` is initialized to 0.
   - `min_lcm` is initialized to the LCM of \( a \) and \( b \) using the `func_2` function.

3. **Loop Logic**:
   - The program continues to loop, incrementing \( k \), and calculates the LCM of \( a + k \) and \( b + k \).
   - If the new LCM is smaller than `min_lcm`, it updates `min_lcm`.
   - If not, it breaks out of the loop.

4. **Output**: The final result is printed as `k - 1`.

### Potential Issues

1. **Incorrect k Output**: 
   - The output is calculated as `k - 1`, which is problematic. This would be incorrect when the minimal LCM occurs at \( k = 0 \). It results in an output of -1, which is invalid since \( k \) should be a non-negative integer.

2. **Termination Condition**: 
   - The program may prematurely exit when it finds a LCM that is not smaller than `min_lcm`. Thus, it might miss smaller potential \( k \) values that could yield the same minimal LCM but later in the iteration.

3. **Complexity**:
   - The algorithm can potentially loop indefinitely if there are non-increasing sequences of LCM values with constant minima due to improper boundary checks for `k`.

### Example Where Program Fails
Consider \( a = 1 \) and \( b = 2 \):
- \( k = 0 \): LCM(1, 2) = 2.
- \( k = 1 \): LCM(2, 3) = 6.
- \( k = 2 \): LCM(3, 4) = 12.
- The program will find that \( k = 0 \) yields the smallest LCM.
- The program will then output \( k - 1 = -1 \), which is invalid.

### Conclusion
Given these issues, specifically the incorrect output when \( k = 0 \) leads to a result of -1, the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
