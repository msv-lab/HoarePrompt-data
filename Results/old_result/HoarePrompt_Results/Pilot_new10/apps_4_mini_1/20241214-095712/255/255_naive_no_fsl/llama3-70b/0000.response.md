Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The program attempts to count distinct segments of the string where characters change from one to another. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the required operations to remove the entire string as outlined in the problem description. 

For example, consider the input string `s = "aaaabbbbcccc"`. 

According to the problem description, the minimum operations to delete this string would be `3`:
1. Remove the substring "aaaa" (operation 1).
2. Remove the substring "bbbb" (operation 2).
3. Remove the substring "cccc" (operation 3).

However, the provided program would calculate this as follows:
- It would see that `s[1]` is different from `s[0]`, incrementing `ans` to 2.
- Then it would increment again when it encounters a different character, ending with a value of `5`.

Thus, the output for this case would be `5`, which is incorrect. Therefore, there are cases where the program does not behave as expected, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
