The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, which converts the user's input into an integer within the defined range (1 <= n <= 500). The variable `s` remains unchanged, as it does not get affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` based on user input while retaining the constraint that it lies within the specified range, and `s` still holds its previous value.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input within the range 1 to 500; `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.**
