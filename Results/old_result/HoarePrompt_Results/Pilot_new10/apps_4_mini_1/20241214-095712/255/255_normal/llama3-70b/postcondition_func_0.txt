The function accepts an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 500) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters. It counts and prints the number of distinct consecutive character sequences in `s`. If all characters are the same, it will return 1, as there are no transitions. The function does not return any value but directly prints the result.
