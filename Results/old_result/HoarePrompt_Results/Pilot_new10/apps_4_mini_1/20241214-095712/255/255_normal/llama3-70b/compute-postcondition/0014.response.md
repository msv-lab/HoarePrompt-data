Since the code is printing the value of `ans`, we can summarize the state based on the initial state and the functionality of the `print` function. The value of `ans` itself is not changed; it is simply outputted.

However, the state of `ans` remains valid as per the initial conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input within the range 1 to 500, `s` is a string of length `n`, and `ans` remains the count of distinct character sequences in `s`. The value of `ans` has been printed.**
