Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. The task is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the string `s` entirely by removing contiguous substrings of equal characters. However, the program simply counts the number of distinct character transitions in the string.

To illustrate this, consider the input:

```
8
abcddcba
```

According to the problem, the sequence of operations could be as follows:

1. Remove `dd` (one operation)
2. Remove `abc` and `cba` in two separate operations (two operations)

So the total number of operations required is 4. 

The program's logic incorrectly counts the transitions between different characters, which does not correspond to the goal of minimizing the operations of deleting contiguous substrings.

Therefore, since there are potential inputs where the program fails to provide the correct output, it is incorrect.
