The value of `ans` is incremented by 1, meaning if its previous value is 2, now it would be 3. The value of `i` is not changed, and all other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` is 3, `i` is `i + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `s` is a string of length `n`, `ans` is 3, `i` is `i + 1**.
