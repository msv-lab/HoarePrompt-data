Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem requires calculating the minimum number of operations needed to delete an entire string by removing contiguous substrings of equal characters. However, the program incorrectly counts the number of distinct character transitions in the string rather than the necessary operations to delete it.

For example, consider the string "aaabaaa". The correct approach would identify that we can perform one operation to delete "aaa" at the beginning, leaving "baaa". In this case, we would then need a second operation to delete the "aaa" at the end, resulting in a total of 2 operations to fully delete the string. However, the provided program would output 4 because it counts the transitions from 'a' to 'b' and back, rather than focusing on the allowed deletions of contiguous substrings.

This demonstrates that the program does not account for the nature of the operations specified (deleting contiguous substrings of the same character), leading to an incorrect solution. Thus, it does not follow the problem description as required.
