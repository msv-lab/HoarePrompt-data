The `print` function outputs the value of `max_erase` without changing any variable values. The values of `i`, `j`, and `n` remain intact as well. The variable `max_erase` continues to represent the maximum length of segments satisfying the specified condition in `a`. Therefore, the Output State remains unchanged for all values, but includes the printed value of `max_erase`.

Output State: **`max_erase` is the maximum length of segments satisfying the condition found in `a`, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `n + 1`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, and `max_erase` is printed.**
