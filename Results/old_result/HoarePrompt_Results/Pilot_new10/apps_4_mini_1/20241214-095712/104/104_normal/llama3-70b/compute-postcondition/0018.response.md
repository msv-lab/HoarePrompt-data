The code snippet assigns `max_erase` the maximum value between its current value and the expression `j - i - 1`. The current state has `j` as 2 and `i` as 1. Therefore, the expression `j - i - 1` evaluates to `2 - 1 - 1`, which is equal to `0`. 

The value of `max_erase` could either remain the same or become `0` if it was lower than the current `max_erase`. However, we cannot determine the previous value of `max_erase`, but it can be greater than or equal to `0`.

Thus, since we do not have a specific initial value for `max_erase`, we will state the possible output state.

Output State: **`max_erase` is the maximum value found (either remains the same or increases to 0), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2, with the difference condition holding true.**
