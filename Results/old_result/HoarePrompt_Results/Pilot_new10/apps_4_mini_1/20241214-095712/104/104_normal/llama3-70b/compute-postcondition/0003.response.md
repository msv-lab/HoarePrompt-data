According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Given that `n` is an integer and that the specified range for `n` is between 1 and 100, this ensures that the loop will execute at least once. The loop uses a variable `i` which will take values from `0` to `n-1`. In addition, there are no inherent dependencies within the loop on the values of the list `a` or `max_erase` for its execution to begin.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, and `i` will start at 0. Since no other state needs to change for the loop execution, it's sufficient to indicate `i`'s starting value.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `i` is 0**
