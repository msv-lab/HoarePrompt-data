The `print(max_erase)` statement outputs the value of `max_erase`, which represents the maximum value of `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `n - 1`. The values of `n`, `a`, and `max_erase` remain valid, but only `max_erase` is specifically changed by being calculated before this print statement. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100; `a` is a list of integers; `max_erase` has been computed and represents the maximum value of `a[i] - a[i - 1] - 1` for all `i` in the range from 1 to `n - 1, and it is printed.**
