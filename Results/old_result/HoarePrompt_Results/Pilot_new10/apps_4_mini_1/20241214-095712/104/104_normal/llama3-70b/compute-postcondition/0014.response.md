Output State: **`max_erase` is the maximum value representing the longest consecutive segment found in the array `a` that satisfies the condition given, `i` is still 0, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, and if there were no valid segments, `max_erase` remains at its initial value.**
