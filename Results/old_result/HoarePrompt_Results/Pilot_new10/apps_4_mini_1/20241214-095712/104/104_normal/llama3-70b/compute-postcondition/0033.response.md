To analyze the impact of the code provided on the initial state variables, we will follow the guidelines specified:

1. **Evaluate** `max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)`.
2. From the initial state, we know `i` is 2 and `j` is 4. Therefore:
   - We calculate `j - i - 1`:
     - `j - i - 1 = 4 - 2 - 1 = 1`.
   
3. The `max` function compares `max_erase` (which remains unchanged for now) with the calculated value (1) and assigns the greater of the two to `max_erase`. Hence, if `max_erase` is less than or equal to 1, it will be updated to 1; otherwise, it will remain its previous value.

Since `max_erase` would be updated according to the result of the `max` function, we can describe the final state as follows:

Output State: **`max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 1; `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `n` must be at least 4**.
