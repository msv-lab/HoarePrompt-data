The function accepts an integer `n`, where `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) indicates the number of elements in an array, followed by `n` strictly increasing integers (1 ≤ a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_n ≤ 1000). It then calculates the maximum number of integers that can be erased between consecutive elements in the array and prints this value. If `n` is 1, the function will return 0 since there are no pairs of elements to compare.
