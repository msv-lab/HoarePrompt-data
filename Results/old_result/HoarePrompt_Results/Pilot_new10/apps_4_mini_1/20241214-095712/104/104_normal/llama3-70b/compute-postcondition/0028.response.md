According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and the initialization of `i`. The loop will execute if the starting value `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n + 1`, which translates to ensuring that `i + 1` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. 

In this case, since `i` is 2 and `n` must be greater than 2, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 3 (so that `i + 1` is 3 and `j` can take on values starting from 3). 

Therefore, the conditions necessary for the loop execution are:
1. `max_erase` can remain as is, given it does not affect the loop execution.
2. `i` is 2, which is needed for the starting point of the loop.
3. `j` will initialize to `n + 1`, but since `n` must be greater than 2, `j` starts at at least 4.

Thus, the proper state adjustments before the loop execution are:
State: **`max_erase` is the maximum length of segments satisfying the condition found in `a`, `i` is 2, `j` will start from 3, `n` must be at least 3**.
