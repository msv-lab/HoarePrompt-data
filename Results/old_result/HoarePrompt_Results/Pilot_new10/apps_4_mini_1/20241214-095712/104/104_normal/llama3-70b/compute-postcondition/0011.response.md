According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over `j`, starting from `i + 1` and going up to `n + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than or equal to `n + 1`. Since `n` is at least 2, `n + 1` is at least 3. 

To execute the loop one more time, `j` must be incremented by 1. Thus, `j` will become 3 if it executes again. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 3.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3**
