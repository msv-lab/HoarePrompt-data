The value of `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer in the range 1 to 100. The values of the array `a_i` are not affected by this line of code, as they depend on the input provided by the user but are not modified here. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n` based on user input.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, indicating the number of elements in the array; the array `a_i` is not modified.**
