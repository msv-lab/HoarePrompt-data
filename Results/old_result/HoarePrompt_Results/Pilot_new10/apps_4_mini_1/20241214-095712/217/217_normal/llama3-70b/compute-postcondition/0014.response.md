According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` must be less than `n` so that the loop continues. Since `i` is updated to the next integer after the current one, for the next iteration `i` will be `i + 1`. 

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than `i + 1` in order for the loop to execute one more time. 

Therefore, if `i` was odd at the end of the last iteration, we recognize that after the loop, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and must be greater than `i + 1`**.
