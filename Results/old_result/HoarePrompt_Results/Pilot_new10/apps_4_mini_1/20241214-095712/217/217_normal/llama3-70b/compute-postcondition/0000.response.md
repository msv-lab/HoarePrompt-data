The variable `n` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, which means it will now hold the value of a new integer input from the user, but it will still remain a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The list `a` is not affected by this code snippet since it does not modify or reference `a`. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `n` is an input integer.**
