`result` is assigned the value of `B - C`, where `B` is the sum of all positive integers in `a` and `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`. This means `result` represents the net sum of all integers in `a`, taking into account the positive integers and the negative integers. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100, `B` is equal to the sum of all positive integers in `a`, `C` is the sum of all negative integers in `a`, and `result` is equal to `B - C`.**
