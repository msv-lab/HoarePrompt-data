The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer with constraints of `1 ≤ n ≤ 100`. The parameter `a` is a list containing `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` satisfies the constraint `-100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100`. Based on the provided constraints, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, which each fall within the specified range. However, the information provided does not indicate what the function does with these inputs or what it returns. Therefore, based on the output constraints, we can summarize the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers where each integer is between -100 and 100.**
