The list `a` will be sorted in reverse order. The initial state specifies that `a` is a list of integers from input. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, this implies that the length of the list `a` can be between 1 and 100. The values themselves haven't been altered; only their order has changed. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order.**
