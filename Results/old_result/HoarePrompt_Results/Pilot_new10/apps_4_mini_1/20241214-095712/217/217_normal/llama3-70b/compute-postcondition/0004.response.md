According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`, which is defined as a positive integer in the range of 1 to 100. Since `n` is granted to be positive (at least 1), the loop will definitely execute for at least one iteration. 

At the beginning of the loop:
- `i` will start from 0 (the first value in `range(n)`).
- The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` will remain unchanged, as they are not directly affected at the start of the loop.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we are clear that `i` starts at 0. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) do not need to change based on the information given about the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `b` is 0, `c` is 0, `i` is 0**
