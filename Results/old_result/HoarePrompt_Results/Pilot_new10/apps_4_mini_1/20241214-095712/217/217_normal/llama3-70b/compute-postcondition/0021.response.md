Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` integers, sorts the list in descending order, and calculates the difference between the sum of integers at even indices and the sum of integers at odd indices. It then prints this difference. The function does not return any value; it only outputs the result to the console.**
