The variable `c` is incremented by the value of `a[i]`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\) and must be greater than `i + 1`, `i` is guaranteed to be less than \(n - 1\). The state of all other variables is not affected. Therefore, after executing the code, we maintain the conditions for `n` and `i`, and `c` becomes `c + a[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and must be greater than `i + 1`; `c` is increased by `a[i]`.**
