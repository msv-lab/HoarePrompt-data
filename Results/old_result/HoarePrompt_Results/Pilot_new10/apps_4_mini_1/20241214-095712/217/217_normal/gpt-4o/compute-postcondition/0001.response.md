The variable `a` is assigned the value generated by `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which converts a space-separated string input into a list of integers. The input must satisfy the condition that there are `n` integers, where each integer `a_i` meets the requirement of -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.

Therefore, while `n` remains unchanged, the list `a` is updated to contain the newly provided integer values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer input (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `a` is a list of n integers where each integer a_i satisfies -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 from the input.**
