After analyzing the provided initial state and the loop code, here is the determined output state after all iterations of the loop have finished executing.

The loop iterates `n` times, where `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100). During each iteration, the variable `i` takes on values from 0 to `n-1`. Depending on whether `i` is even or odd, the corresponding values from the list `a` are added to either `b` or `c`. After all iterations, `b` will contain the sum of all elements from `a` at even indices, and `c` will contain the sum of all elements from `a` at odd indices.

If `n` is 1, the loop will execute once and will update `b` with `a[0]`, while `c` remains 0. 

If `n` is 2, the loop will execute twice: `b` will be incremented by `a[0]` and `c` will be incremented by `a[1]`.

Thus, for any value of `n`, `b` will hold the sum of elements at even indices up to `n-1`, and `c` will hold the sum of elements at odd indices up to `n-1`.

Output State: **`b` is the sum of elements in `a` at even indices, `c` is the sum of elements in `a` at odd indices, and `a` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order.**
