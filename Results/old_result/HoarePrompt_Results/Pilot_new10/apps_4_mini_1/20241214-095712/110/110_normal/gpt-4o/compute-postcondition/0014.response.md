According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y` and `m`. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 1 and `m` must be greater than 1, indicating that it can execute at least one more time. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `y` needs to be increased by 1 (from 1 to 2). Since `m` must be greater than 1, `m` can remain the same.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` must be greater than 1, `y` is 2, a tuple `(-coverage(x, 1), x, 1)` has been pushed onto the `heap`.**
