The function `heapq.heappush` is called to add a new element to the heap. The value being pushed onto the heap is a tuple consisting of three values: the negative coverage of `(x, y)`, and the values of `x` and `y`. Since `y` is 0, the function `coverage(x, y)` will calculate its value based on `x` and `y`.

The initial state does not provide specific values for `x`, `y`, or the coverage function. However, we know:
- `n` is between 1 and 10^5
- `m` is greater than 0
- `y` is initialized to 0

After executing the push, the state of the heap will be modified, but we do not have enough detail about `coverage(x, y)` to provide further specifics.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` is greater than 0, `y` is 0, and a new item has been pushed onto the heap with the value (-coverage(x, 0), x, 0).**
