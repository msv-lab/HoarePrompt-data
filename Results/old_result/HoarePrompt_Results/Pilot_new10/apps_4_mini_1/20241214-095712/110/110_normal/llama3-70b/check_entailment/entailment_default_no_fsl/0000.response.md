Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Specifically, it returns the maximum number of fishes that can be caught in relation to the total number of scoopable positions, rather than calculating the expected number of fishes caught when the scoop is placed in a random position. 

1. The calculation of the expected value of the number of caught fishes is incorrect. The correct expected value should consider the distribution of k fishes across the pond and the total number of scoopable positions the scoop can occupy. The formula used in the code does not reflect this logic.

2. The program may encounter an issue if the size of the scoop (r) is equal to or larger than the dimensions of the pond (n or m). In such cases, the number of scoopable positions will be zero, leading to a division by zero when calculating `ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`.

3. The output hints suggest that the function will return the proportion of the maximum possible fishes that can be caught to the total scoopable positions, which does not align with what is required by the problem. 

For example, if n = 2, m = 2, r = 3, and k = 1, the program will attempt to compute using non-existent scoop positions, yielding an undefined behavior.

Therefore, due to the incorrect implementation and potential for division by zero, the program fails to meet the problem description correctly for all cases.
