You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the core logic of the program.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We have a pond of size `n × m`.
2. We have a scoop of size `r × r`.
3. We want to place `k` fishes in distinct cells of the pond.
4. We need to maximize the expected number of fishes caught by the scoop when placed randomly within the bounds of the pond.

### Expected Value Calculation:
The expected number of caught fishes can be determined by:
- The maximum possible positions the scoop can be placed is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`, which is calculated as the area where the scoop can fit within the pond.
- The maximum number of fishes that can be placed in a way that would maximize the expected value would be the minimum of `k` and the number of scoop positions.

### Code Logic:
```python
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))
```
This code:
- Calculates how many fishes can be placed within the constraints of the scoop's area, using `min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))`.
- Divides this count by the total number of scoop positions to get the expected value.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:
1. If `n` or `m` is very small compared to `r`, `(n - r + 1)` or `(m - r + 1)` would be zero or negative. Since `0` can never yield a valid position, the code will produce a division by zero error.
2. The potential case where `r > n` or `r > m` hasn't been handled. In such scenarios, the expected number of caught fishes should logically be `0.0`, but the program attempts to calculate a value which would result in an incorrect output.

### Conclusion:
The program incorrectly calculates the expected number of caught fish when the size of the scoop is larger than the dimensions of the pond. For example, consider the following input:
```
1 1 2 1
```
Here `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `r = 2`, and `k = 1`. The program will attempt to compute `(1 - 2 + 1) * (1 - 2 + 1)` which results in `0` for both dimensions leading to a division by zero.

Thus, the program does not handle all potential inputs correctly.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts four integers as input: `n` (pond length), `m` (pond width), `r` (scoop size), and `k` (number of fishes). It calculates the maximum number of fishes that can be found within a scoopable area of the pond and returns the proportion of that maximum to the total possible number of scoopable positions. If the total number of scoopable positions is zero (which happens if `n` is less than or equal to `r` or `m` is less than or equal to `r`), the function will perform the division but may yield an undefined behavior. Therefore, there is a potential edge case where division by zero can occur. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
