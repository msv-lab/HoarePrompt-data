To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the requirements of the problem and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Analysis
1. We need to position `k` fishes in a rectangular pond of size `n × m` such that the expected number of fishes caught by a scoop of size `r × r` is maximized.
2. The scoop can be placed at various positions, with the number of valid positions being `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.
3. The average number of caught fishes is calculated based on the positions of the fishes within the area that the scoop can cover.

### Program Logic
1. The function reads the dimensions of the pond (`n`, `m`), the size of the scoop (`r`), and the number of fishes (`k`).
2. The variable `ans` is computed as the minimum of `k` and the total number of positions where the fishes can be caught, which is `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`.
3. The program then outputs the expected value of the number of caught fishes by dividing `ans` by the total number of valid scoop positions.

### Evaluation of Program
- The line `ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))` correctly limits the maximum number of fishes that can be positioned in distinct cells to the number of possible scoop positions, which ensures that the placement of fishes cannot exceed the area where they can actually be caught.

- The final expected value calculation provided by `print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))` is designed to compute the average number of fishes caught when the scoop is placed randomly. This is correct since it divides the number of fishes that can be caught by the total number of valid placements.

### Conclusion
The program logic adheres to the requirements set out in the problem description correctly, as it accounts for the maximum placement of fishes, valid positions of the scoop, and computes the expected value accurately.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **True**
