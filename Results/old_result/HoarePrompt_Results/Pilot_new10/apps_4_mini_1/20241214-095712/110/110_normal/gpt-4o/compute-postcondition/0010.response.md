According to the code, the loop iterates over the range of `m`. Since it is given that `m` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `y` will equal `m-1`. 

Previously, it was stated that `y` is `m - 1`, but based on the for loop `y` would start at 0 and increment until it reaches `m-1`. To set the correct state for the loop execution, it is necessary to adjust `y` to start from 0.

Thus, for the loop to be executed correctly:
- `y` should be initialized to 0 (the starting point in the loop),
- `m` must be greater than 0 to ensure at least one iteration occurs.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` is greater than 0, `y` is 0**
