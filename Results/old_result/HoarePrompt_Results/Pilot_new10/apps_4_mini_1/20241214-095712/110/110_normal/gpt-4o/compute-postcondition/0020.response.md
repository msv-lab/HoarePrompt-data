According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. If `y` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is 0 and `m` is greater than 0. At the beginning of the next iteration, `y` will be incremented by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be at least 2 (as `y` will now be 1).

State: **`n` cannot be greater than `n`, `m` must be greater than 1, `y` is 1, heap contains `m` tuples and an additional tuple `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` has been pushed onto the heap.**
