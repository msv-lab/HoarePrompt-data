Initial State: `n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` is greater than 0, `y` is `m-1`, and the heap contains `m` items each pushed onto it with the format (-coverage(x, y), x, y) for y in range(m), x is 1.

The loop iterates over a range defined by `m`, and for each iteration `y`, it pushes a tuple of the format `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` onto the heap.

Since `y` goes from 0 to `m-1`, after the loop executes exactly `m` times:

- The value of `y` will be `m-1` (the last value in the loop).
- The heap will contain `m` tuples, each representing a coverage value and its corresponding indices.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 10^5, `m` is greater than 0, `y` is `m-1`, and the heap contains `m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(1, y), 1, y)` for each `y` in the range from 0 to `m-1`.**
