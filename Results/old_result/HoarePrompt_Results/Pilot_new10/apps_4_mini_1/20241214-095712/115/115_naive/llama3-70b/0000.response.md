To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and see if it can handle every potential case as stipulated by the requirements.

### Key Requirements:
1. The program has to manipulate matrix `B` such that it becomes equal to matrix `A` using `2x2` submatrix operations.
2. If it is impossible to make matrices equal, the program must return `-1`.
3. The operations should comply with the defined limits (0 ≤ k ≤ 2500).
4. It must correctly track and record the operations needed to achieve the transformation.

### Analysis of the Program:
The code provided:
1. Reads the dimensions of the matrix and the matrix `A`.
2. Initializes an empty list for operations `ops`.
3. Loops through each possible position in the matrix to check if operations should be localized based on the elements of matrix `A`.
4. The conditions check if four elements form a `2x2` block of ones and continues if they do; otherwise, it appends the current index as an operation.
5. Finally, it checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500, printing `-1`, otherwise it prints the number of operations and the operations themselves.

### Potential Issues:
1. The program does not correctly handle the case when there is a `1` in `A` that cannot be covered by any `2x2` operation. For example, if there's a `1` isolated at (1, 2) (where a `2x2` operation cannot cover it), the program would append an operation regardless, which will eventually fail to yield a valid `B`, resulting in an erroneous scenario.
2. The operations do not account for leftover `1`s that remain uncovered at the end of the check.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```
- In this scenario, the program would append `(1, 1)` to `ops` because it finds a 1 at `A[0][0]`, but it wouldn't be able to cover the `1`s at `A[0][0]` and `A[0][2]` because they are not part of any `2x2` block. Thus, it should return `-1` because it's impossible to achieve `A` using valid `2x2` operations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the provided example, there's a clear demonstration of a potential failure in the logic of the program to cater to the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
