Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program attempts to determine if it is possible to transform a matrix `B` (initially filled with zeros) into another matrix `A` using a sequence of operations that set `2x2` submatrices of `B` to `1`. However, it contains logic flaws that can lead to incorrect results.

Here is a counterexample that illustrates the failure of the program:

### Counterexample:
Consider the following input:

```
n = 3, m = 3
A = [
    [1, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0]
]
```

According to the problem description, to make `B` equal to `A`, we can analyze:

1. The program correctly identifies that it can set the `2x2` submatrix at `(0,0)` since all four elements are `1` in `A`.
2. After applying the operation, the resulting matrix `B` would be:

```
B = [
    [1, 1, 0],
    [1, 1, 0],
    [0, 0, 0]
]
```

3. The program would then verify that `B` indeed equals `A` and will output the operations performed.

However, the program incorrectly checks and returns `-1` in cases where the desired matrix `A` contains isolated `1`s that cannot be filled by the `2x2` operation. For instance, if `A` has a `1` at position `(0,2)`, which is not part of any `2x2` configuration, the program will say it is impossible to achieve `A` from `B`, even if the other elements match. 

Thus, this specific input reveals that the program does not consider scenarios where some `1`s in the matrix cannot be converted without neglecting the required subsequent configuration of `1`s.

Therefore, the code fails to handle this case and is incorrect according to the specifications given in the problem description. Hence, the final verdict on its correctness is `False`.
