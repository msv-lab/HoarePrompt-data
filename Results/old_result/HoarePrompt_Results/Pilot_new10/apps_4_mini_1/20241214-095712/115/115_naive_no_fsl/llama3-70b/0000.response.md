Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly transform matrix `B` into matrix `A` as required by the problem description. Specifically, it fails to account for the possibility that not all individual `1`s in matrix `A` can form `2x2` blocks that can be fully transformed into `1`s using the defined operations.

For example, consider the following test case:

Input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```

In this scenario, matrix `A` has `1`s that do not form any `2x2` block (`A[0][0]` (1), `A[1][0]` (1), `A[0][2]` (1), `A[1][2]` (1)) and the program would incorrectly attempt to add operations for positions without checking if a `2x2` block can be formed. The logic inside the loop falsely includes positions with isolated `1`s in matrix `A`.

The program will collect operation coordinates `ops` as it finds `1`s without creating a defined `2x2` pattern needed to interact with matrix `B`. This can lead to sequences of operations that do not effectively turn all required positions in `B` to `1` as `A` demands. 

This scenario leads to an incorrect output because matrix `B` would not equal matrix `A` after performing operations suggested by the program, hence confirming that the program is incorrect.
