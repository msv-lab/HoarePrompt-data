The operation `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` adds a tuple to the list `operations` with the values of `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Given the initial state where `i` is 2 and `j` is 2, the calculations result in:

- `i + 1` evaluates to `3`
- `j + 1` evaluates to `3`

Therefore, the tuple `(3, 3)` will be appended to `operations`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `B[i][j]` is 1, `B[i][j + 1]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j]` is 1, `B[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1; operations contains the tuple (3, 3)**.
