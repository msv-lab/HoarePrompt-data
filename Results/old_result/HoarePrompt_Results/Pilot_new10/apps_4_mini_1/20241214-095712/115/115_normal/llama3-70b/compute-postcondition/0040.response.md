To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the conditions set within the loop as well as the variables involved.

1. The loop iterates `j` from `0` to `m - 2` (inclusive), which means the loop will execute `m - 1` times.
2. For each iteration:
   - If all of the values `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are equal to 1, the loop continues without appending anything to `ops`.
   - If at least one of these values is equal to 1, the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` is appended to `ops`.

Based on the specified initial state and the behavior of the loop, we can generalize the output state:

- After the loop completes all iterations, `j` will be equal to `m - 1` (the loop index will increment up to `m - 1` but will be 0-indexed).
- The variable `ops` will contain tuples for every iteration where at least one of the relevant values is equal to 1. However, if all four values are equal to 1 in any iteration, that iteration will not result in an append operation to `ops`.
- Given that at least one of the conditions for appending to `ops` must hold for the loop to execute the specified number of times, `ops` will ultimately contain zero or more tuples based on the specific entries in `A`.

Now, formulating the final output state after the loop:

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `m - 1`, `ops` contains the tuples (2, j+1) for each executed iteration where at least one of `A[0][j]`, `A[1][j]`, `A[0][j + 1]`, or `A[1][j + 1]` is equal to 1.**
