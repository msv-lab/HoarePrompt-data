Output State: **`B` contains relevant positions indicating successful transformations, `operations` may be empty, `m` is greater than 0, `A[k + 1][j]` equals `B[k + 1][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `m-1`, `i` is `k + 1` (which is less than `n`), `j` is equal to `m`, and all elements of `A[i][j]` have been verified to equal the corresponding elements in `B[i][j]` for all `j` from 0 to `m-1`. No return value has occurred during the loop execution.**
