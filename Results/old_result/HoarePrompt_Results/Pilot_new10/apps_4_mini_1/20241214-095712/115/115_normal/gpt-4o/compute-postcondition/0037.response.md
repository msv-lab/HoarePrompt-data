Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is 0. If `A[2][0] = 1`, `A[2][1] = 1`, `A[3][0] = 1`, and `A[3][1] = 1`, then `B[2][0] = 1`, `B[2][1] = 1`, `B[3][0] = 1`, `B[3][1] = 1`, and `operations` has been updated to include (3, 1). Otherwise, the program executes with the initial state unchanged, as there is no else part to modify any variables.***
