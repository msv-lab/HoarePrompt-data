According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `m`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, which means the loop has executed once. For the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by 1, making it 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `m` must be greater than 2, since if `m` were 2, then `m - 1` would equal 1, meaning the loop would only execute once and not again. 

Thus, at the start of the next iteration, the state of the variables will be modified as follows: `j` becomes 1 and `m` must remain at least 2 to ensure that the loop condition can still be valid for the next round. 

State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, and `j` is 1**
