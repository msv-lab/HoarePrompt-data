The code initializes an empty list named `operations`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `m`, or the list `A`. Therefore, the output state should accurately reflect this situation.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50, and A is a list of n lists, each containing m integers where each integer is either 0 or 1; `operations` is an empty list**.
