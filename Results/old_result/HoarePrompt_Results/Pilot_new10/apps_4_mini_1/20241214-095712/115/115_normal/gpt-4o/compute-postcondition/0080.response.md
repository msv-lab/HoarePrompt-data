According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` and the total number of iterations determined by `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` are equal, which implies that `j` must be the index of the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, and it must be ensured that `m` is greater than this new value of `j`. 

So if at the end of the last iteration `j` is equal to the last valid index (which would be `m - 1` for `m` iterations), then for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be `m`, and `m` must be greater than `m`.

State: **`A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` are equal, `j` is `m`, `m` must be greater than `m`**
