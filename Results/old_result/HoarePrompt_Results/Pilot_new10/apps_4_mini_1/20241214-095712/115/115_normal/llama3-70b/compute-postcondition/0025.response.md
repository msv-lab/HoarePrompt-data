The code `continue` is used within a loop to skip the rest of the code in the current iteration and continue with the next iteration of the loop. Since the initial state does not specify any loop or any changes to the values of variables `A`, `n`, `m`, `i`, or `j` directly by executing this line of code, the values of these variables remain unchanged. The `continue` statement essentially indicates that we are bypassing further processing inside a loop but does not affect the values of any variables or their states.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and at least one of `A[0][0], A[1][0], A[0][1], or A[1][1]` is equal to 1. The value of `A[i][j]` is equal to 1, the value of `A[i + 1][j]` is equal to 1, the value of `A[i][j + 1]` is equal to 1, and the value of `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1.**
