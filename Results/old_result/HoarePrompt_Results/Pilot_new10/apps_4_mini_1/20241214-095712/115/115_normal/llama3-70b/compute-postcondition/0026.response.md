Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and at least one of `A[0][0], A[1][0], A[0][1], or A[1][1]` is equal to 1. If the condition `A[i][j] == 1`, `A[i + 1][j] == 1`, `A[i][j + 1] == 1`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` hold true, all of these elements are equal to 1.***
