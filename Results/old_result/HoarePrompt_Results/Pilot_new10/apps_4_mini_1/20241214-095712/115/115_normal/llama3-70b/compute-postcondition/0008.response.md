Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `n` is an integer from 2 to 50, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. The condition `(A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1)` is true, meaning at least one of the elements `A[0][0]`, `A[1][0]`, `A[0][1]`, or `A[1][1]` is 1. If the specific condition `A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1` is also met, then `A[0][0]` is 1, `A[1][0]` is 1, `A[0][1]` is 1, and `A[1][1]` is 1. If not, the state of `A` remains unchanged with respect to this condition.***
