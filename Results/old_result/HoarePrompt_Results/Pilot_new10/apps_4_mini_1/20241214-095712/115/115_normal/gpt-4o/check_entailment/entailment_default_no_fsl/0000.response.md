Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly determine when it is impossible to produce matrix `A` from matrix `B`. Specifically, it only checks for possible placements of `2x2` blocks of `1`s in `A` but does not account for situations where `A` contains `1`s at positions that cannot be covered by any `2x2` block.

For example, consider the following input:
```
2 3
1 1 0
0 0 0
```
In this case, there's a `1` in the first row and first two columns, but the single `0` in the last column means that it is impossible to transform matrix `B` into matrix `A` through the allowed operations. The program would incorrectly not return `-1` because it would look for `2x2` blocks and would not find them since the `0` in the bottom row does not provide an opportunity to cover the `1s` in the top row.

Thus, there are scenarios in which the program does not follow the problem requirements accurately, demonstrating that it is incorrect for at least some inputs.
