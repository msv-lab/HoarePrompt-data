The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `A`. Here, `n` and `m` are integers constrained to the range 2 to 50, and `A` is a 2D list of integers, where each element is either 0 or 1, and `A` consists of `n` rows and `m` columns. The function's output is not specified in the provided details, so I cannot describe the return value without that information. 

Assuming that the function processes the 2D list based on its contents, I would need additional information about the output to conclude the functionality definitively. However, following the provided functionality focus, I can state the parameter acceptance.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (an integer), m (an integer), and A (a 2D list of integers containing only 0s and 1s), where n and m are bounded between 2 and 50.**
