The code appends a tuple to the `operations` list containing `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Given the initial state, `i` is 1 and `j` is 0. Therefore, the tuple that will be appended is `(2, 1)`. Other variables remain unaffected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `B[1][0]` = 1, `B[1][1]` = 1, `B[2][0]` = 1, `B[2][1]` = 1, and `operations` now includes the tuple `(2, 1)`**.
