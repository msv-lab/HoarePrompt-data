The code snippet `ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))` adds a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. In this case, given that `i` is 1 and `j` is 1, the tuple that will be added is `(2, 2)`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the information about the state of `ops` will now include this new tuple.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ops` now contains the tuple (2, 2); if `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then `ops` contains the tuple (2, 1)**.
