Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1. If at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is equal to 1, then `ops` has an additional tuple (3, 2) appended. If none of these conditions are met, `ops` remains unchanged.***
