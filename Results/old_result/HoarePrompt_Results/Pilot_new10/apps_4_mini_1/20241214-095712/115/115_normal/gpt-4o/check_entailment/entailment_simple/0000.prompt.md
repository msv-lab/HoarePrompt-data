You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ â€” the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 1

Output
3
1 1
1 2
2 2

Input
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0

Output
-1

Input
3 2
0 0
0 0
0 0

Output
0



-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    A = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(m):
            row.append(int(data[index]))
            index += 1
        A.append(row)
    func_1(n, m, A)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50, and A is a list of n lists, each containing m integers where each integer is either 0 or 1.
def func_1(n, m, A):
    operations = []
    B = [([0] * m) for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i][j + 1] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][
                j + 1] == 1:
                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `B` contains `1` at positions where the corresponding `2x2` submatrices in `A` were all `1`, `operations` contains tuples for each successful transformation, if any. If no transformations occur, `B` remains a list initialized to `0`, and `operations` remains empty.
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] != B[i][j]:
                return -1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `B` contains positions indicating successful transformations, `operations` reflects any transformations applied or is empty, `A[i][j]` equals `B[i][j]` for all `i` from `0` to `n-1` and `j` from `0` to `m-1`, `n` is the number of rows, `m` is the number of columns, and neither can be zero (both must be positive integers).
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `B` contains positions indicating successful transformations, `operations` is a list of transformations with length equal to the number of transformations applied, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, the first two elements of each `op` have been printed for each transformation in `operations`. If `operations` is empty, `B` remains unchanged and `operations` is an empty list.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
