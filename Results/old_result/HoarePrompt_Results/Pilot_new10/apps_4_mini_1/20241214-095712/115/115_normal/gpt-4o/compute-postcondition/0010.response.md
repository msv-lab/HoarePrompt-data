The code appends a tuple to the `operations` list containing `(i + 1, j + 1)`. Given the initial states, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, so the expression evaluates as follows:

- `i + 1` = 0 + 1 = 1
- `j + 1` = 1 + 1 = 2

Thus, the tuple `(1, 2)` is appended to the `operations` list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `B[0][1] = 1`, `B[0][2] = 1`, `B[1][1] = 1`, `B[1][2] = 1`, operations contains (1, 2)**
