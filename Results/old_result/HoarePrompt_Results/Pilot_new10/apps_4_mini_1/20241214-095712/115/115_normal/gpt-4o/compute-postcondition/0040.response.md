The code appends a tuple (i + 1, j + 1) to the list `operations`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, the values for `i + 1` and `j + 1` are 3 and 2 respectively. Other variables remain unchanged, and we still meet the conditions for `n` and `m`. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `m` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are set to 1, and `operations` now includes the tuple (3, 2).**
