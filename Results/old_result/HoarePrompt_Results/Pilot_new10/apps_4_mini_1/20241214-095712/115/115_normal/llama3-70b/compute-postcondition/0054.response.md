According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the upper limit defined by `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is at least 2. Thus, `m - 1` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making it 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than 2.

State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2**
