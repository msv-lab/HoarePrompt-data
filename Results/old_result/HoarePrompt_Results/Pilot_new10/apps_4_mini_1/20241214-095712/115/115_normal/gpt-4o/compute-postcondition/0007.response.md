Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, and `j` is 0. If `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are all equal to 1, then `operations` now includes the tuple `(1, 1)`, and `B[0][0]`, `B[0][1]`, `B[1][0]`, and `B[1][1]` are all set to 1. Otherwise, no changes occur as there is no else part.***
