Postcondition: ***`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is 2. If at least one of the values `A[1][2]`, `A[2][2]`, `A[1][3]`, or `A[2][3]` is equal to 1, then `ops` contains the tuple (2, 2), and if all four values are equal to 1, `ops` contains the tuple (2, 1). If none of these cells contain 1, no further action is executed and `ops` remains unchanged.***
