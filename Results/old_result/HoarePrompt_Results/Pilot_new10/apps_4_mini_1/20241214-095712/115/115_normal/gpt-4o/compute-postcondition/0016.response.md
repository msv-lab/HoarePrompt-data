Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `j` is less than `m - 1`. If the values in `A` for the current `i` and `j` positions are found to meet the condition of being 1, then corresponding values in `B` are set to 1 for positions `[0][j]`, `[0][j+1]`, `[1][j]`, and `[1][j+1]` for all valid `j`. The `operations` list will contain tuples of the format `(1, j + 1)` for each completed operation, reflecting the successful transformations based on `A`. If the loop does not execute, then `B` remains unchanged, and `operations` will be empty.**
