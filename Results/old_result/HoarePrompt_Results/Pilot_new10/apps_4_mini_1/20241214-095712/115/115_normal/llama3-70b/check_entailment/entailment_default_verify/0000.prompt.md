You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two matrices $A$ and $B$. Each matrix contains exactly $n$ rows and $m$ columns. Each element of $A$ is either $0$ or $1$; each element of $B$ is initially $0$.

You may perform some operations with matrix $B$. During each operation, you choose any submatrix of $B$ having size $2 \times 2$, and replace every element in the chosen submatrix with $1$. In other words, you choose two integers $x$ and $y$ such that $1 \le x < n$ and $1 \le y < m$, and then set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$.

Your goal is to make matrix $B$ equal to matrix $A$. Two matrices $A$ and $B$ are equal if and only if every element of matrix $A$ is equal to the corresponding element of matrix $B$.

Is it possible to make these matrices equal? If it is, you have to come up with a sequence of operations that makes $B$ equal to $A$. Note that you don't have to minimize the number of operations.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $m$ ($2 \le n, m \le 50$).

Then $n$ lines follow, each containing $m$ integers. The $j$-th integer in the $i$-th line is $A_{i, j}$. Each integer is either $0$ or $1$.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible to make $B$ equal to $A$, print one integer $-1$.

Otherwise, print any sequence of operations that transforms $B$ into $A$ in the following format: the first line should contain one integer $k$ — the number of operations, and then $k$ lines should follow, each line containing two integers $x$ and $y$ for the corresponding operation (set $B_{x, y}$, $B_{x, y + 1}$, $B_{x + 1, y}$ and $B_{x + 1, y + 1}$ to $1$). The condition $0 \le k \le 2500$ should hold.

3 3
1 1 1
1 1 1

-----Note-----

The sequence of operations in the first example: $\begin{matrix} 0 & 0 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 0 & & 1 & 1 & 1 & & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 0 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 & \rightarrow & 1 & 1 & 1 \\ 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 0 & 0 & & 0 & 1 & 1 \end{matrix}$
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    A = [list(map(int, input().split())) for _ in range(n)]
    ops = []
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 and A[i + 1][j] == 1 and (A[i][j + 1] == 1) and (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                continue
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or (A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1):
                ops.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    if len(ops) > 2500:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(len(ops))
        for op in ops:
            print(op[0], op[1])


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and see if it can handle every potential case as stipulated by the requirements.

### Key Requirements:
1. The program has to manipulate matrix `B` such that it becomes equal to matrix `A` using `2x2` submatrix operations.
2. If it is impossible to make matrices equal, the program must return `-1`.
3. The operations should comply with the defined limits (0 ≤ k ≤ 2500).
4. It must correctly track and record the operations needed to achieve the transformation.

### Analysis of the Program:
The code provided:
1. Reads the dimensions of the matrix and the matrix `A`.
2. Initializes an empty list for operations `ops`.
3. Loops through each possible position in the matrix to check if operations should be localized based on the elements of matrix `A`.
4. The conditions check if four elements form a `2x2` block of ones and continues if they do; otherwise, it appends the current index as an operation.
5. Finally, it checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500, printing `-1`, otherwise it prints the number of operations and the operations themselves.

### Potential Issues:
1. The program does not correctly handle the case when there is a `1` in `A` that cannot be covered by any `2x2` operation. For example, if there's a `1` isolated at (1, 2) (where a `2x2` operation cannot cover it), the program would append an operation regardless, which will eventually fail to yield a valid `B`, resulting in an erroneous scenario.
2. The operations do not account for leftover `1`s that remain uncovered at the end of the check.

### Example Case:
Consider the following input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```
- In this scenario, the program would append `(1, 1)` to `ops` because it finds a 1 at `A[0][0]`, but it wouldn't be able to cover the `1`s at `A[0][0]` and `A[0][2]` because they are not part of any `2x2` block. Thus, it should return `-1` because it's impossible to achieve `A` using valid `2x2` operations.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis and the provided example, there's a clear demonstration of a potential failure in the logic of the program to cater to the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `n` and `m`, and a 2D list `A` of integers (0s and 1s) of size `n x m`. It checks for every 2x2 sub-square within `A` whether at least one of the four positions contains a 1. If the count of such positions (stored in `ops`) exceeds 2500, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the count of valid operations and the coordinates of each 2D pair where at least one position within the sub-square contains a 1. If there are no valid positions, it will print 0 and not print any coordinates. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
