According to the code, the ability for the loop to execute depends on the value of `j` and `m`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `m - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `m` is greater than or equal to 3, which implies that `m - 1` is at least 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, making `j` equal to 2. For this to be valid, `m` must be at least 4 so that the condition `j < m - 1` holds true. 

State: **`n` is at least 2, `m` must be at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 2**
