The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the current iteration of a loop and proceed to the next iteration. Since there is no indication of the loop context here, no variables are modified, thus the output state will reflect that we simply continue to the next iteration.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers (0 or 1), `n` is an integer from 2 to 50, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2 and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
