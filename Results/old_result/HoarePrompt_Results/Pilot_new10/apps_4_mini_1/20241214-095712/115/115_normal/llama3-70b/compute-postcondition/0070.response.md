The statement `print(op[0], op[1])` prints the first two elements of the list `ops`. Given that `len(ops)` must be at least 2, it follows that both `op[0]` and `op[1]` will return valid values from the `ops` list.

Since the output of the print statement is not affecting any other variables, and only `op[0]` and `op[1]` are involved, the output state can simply highlight the values of these operations along with the preconditions that are still valid.

Output State: **`A` must have at least one valid `(i, j)` pair where at least one of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1; `len(ops)` is at least 2; the values printed are the first two elements of `ops`, `op[0]` and `op[1]`.**
