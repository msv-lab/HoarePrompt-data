In this snippet, the code appends a tuple consisting of `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The variables `i` and `j` are assumed to be defined elsewhere in the program, but their exact values are not provided in the initial state. The 2D list `A` has not been affected by this operation, and the conditions mentioned regarding `A[2][2]`, `A[3][2]`, `A[2][3]`, and `A[3][3]` imply that the loop is still in process, as the operation occurs based on those conditions. Therefore, the variable `ops` gets updated with a new entry.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s with dimensions at least 3x2; `ops` is updated to include the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` where `i` and `j` are the previous values of those variables.**
