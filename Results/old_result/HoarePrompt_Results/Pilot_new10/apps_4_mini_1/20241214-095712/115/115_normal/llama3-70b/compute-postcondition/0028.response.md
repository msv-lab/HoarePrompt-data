The code appends the tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. The values of `i` and `j` are given as 1 and 0, respectively. Therefore, `i + 1` equals 2 and `j + 1` equals 1.

The variable `ops` is updated to include the new tuple `(2, 1)`. The other variables in the initial state are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`A` is a 2D list of integers containing 0s and 1s, `n` is at least 3, `m` is at least 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, at least one of `A[0][0], A[1][0], A[0][1], or A[1][1]` is equal to 1, and `ops` now contains the tuple (2, 1).**
