Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `m` is greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If `A[0][2]`, `A[0][3]`, `A[1][2]`, and `A[1][3]` all equal 1, then `B[0][2]` and `B[0][3]` are set to 1, `B[1][2]` and `B[1][3]` are set to 1, and `operations` now contains the tuple (1, 3). Otherwise, no changes occur.***
