The variable `count` is incremented by 1. The previous state indicates that `count` has already been increased by 1. Therefore, the new state of `count` becomes the prior value plus 2. The states of the other variables `num` and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`num` must be greater than or equal to (i + 1)Â², `i` has been incremented by 1, `count` is increased by 2.**
