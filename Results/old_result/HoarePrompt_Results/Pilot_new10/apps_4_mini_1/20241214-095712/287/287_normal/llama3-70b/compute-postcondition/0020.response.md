The `print(res)` statement outputs the value of `res`, which is equal to the number of divisors of `n`. However, no variables are changed by this action, and the output only reflects the value of `res`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`res` is equal to the number of divisors of `n`, `i` is int(n).**
