`res` is decreased by 1. The initial state indicates that `n` is equal to `i * i`, and since the current value of `i` is 1, `n` is calculated as `1 * 1`, resulting in `n` being 1. The `res` variable is modified by subtracting 1 but its previous value is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state includes the details that `n` is 1 and the new value of `res` is decremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is 1; `res` is decreased by 1.**
