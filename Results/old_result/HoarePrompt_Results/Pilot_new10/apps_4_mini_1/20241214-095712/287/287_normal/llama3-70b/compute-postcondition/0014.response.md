According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is within the range from 1 to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `i` must have reached its final value for the last execution. Since `i` increments by 1 on each iteration, it means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must increase by 1 from its last value. 

Given that the last executed value of `i` is `int(n ** 0.5)`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must equal `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. 

Thus, to determine the states:
- `n` remains the same (as we haven't changed it),
- `i` must be updated to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

For the loop to be able to execute another iteration, the value of `i` needed must fall within the specified condition: using the loop structure, we know that the allowed range states are `1 <= i <= int(n ** 0.5)`. Since `i` will be `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` for the next iteration, for it to execute, `n` must be greater than `int(n ** 0.5)^2`, implying `i` being potentially able to reach below the upper limit.

Therefore, we write:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is int(n ** 0.5) + 1, `res` remains unchanged.**
