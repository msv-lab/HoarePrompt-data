The value of `n` is reassigned by taking an input and converting it to an integer. The new value of `n` is an integer provided by the user, which is still within the range of 1 to 10^9. Other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9**
