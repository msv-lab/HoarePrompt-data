You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Let's define a split of $n$ as a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers, the sum of which is $n$. 

For example, the following sequences are splits of $8$: $[4, 4]$, $[3, 3, 2]$, $[2, 2, 1, 1, 1, 1]$, $[5, 2, 1]$.

The following sequences aren't splits of $8$: $[1, 7]$, $[5, 4]$, $[11, -3]$, $[1, 1, 4, 1, 1]$.

The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element. For example, the weight of the split $[1, 1, 1, 1, 1]$ is $5$, the weight of the split $[5, 5, 3, 3, 3]$ is $2$ and the weight of the split $[9]$ equals $1$.

For a given $n$, find out the number of different weights of its splits.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \leq n \leq 10^9$).


-----Output-----

Output one integer — the answer to the problem.

-----Note-----

In the first sample, there are following possible weights of splits of $7$:

Weight 1: [$\textbf 7$] 

Weight 2: [$\textbf 3$, $\textbf 3$, 1] 

Weight 3: [$\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, $\textbf 2$, 1] 

Weight 7: [$\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$, $\textbf 1$]
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            res += 2
        if i * i == n:
            res -= 1
    print(res)


```
Original Assessment: To assess the correctness of the given Python program based on the provided problem description, we need to evaluate whether it accurately finds the number of different weights of splits for an integer \( n \).

Problem summary:
- A split of \( n \) is a nonincreasing sequence of positive integers whose sum is \( n \).
- The weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element.
- The task is to find the number of different weights of splits of \( n \).

Program analysis:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    res = 0
    for i in range(1, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            res += 2
        if i * i == n:
            res -= 1
    print(res)
```

1. **Understanding the Program Logic**:
   - The program takes an integer \( n \) as input.
   - It calculates the number of divisors of \( n \) using a loop from \( 1 \) to \( \sqrt{n} \).
   - For every divisor \( i \):
     - It increments `res` by 2 (counting both \( i \) and \( n/i \)).
     - It decrements `res` by 1 if \( i \) is the square root of \( n \) (to avoid double-counting).

2. **Identifying Issues**:
   - The program is counting the number of divisors of \( n \), not weights of splits.
   - There is no direct correlation established between the number of divisors and the different weights of the splits.
   - The problem states that the input \( n \) can be as large as \( 10^9 \). The program does not handle this in a way that maps to the task described; merely counting the divisors does not yield the correct answer for the weights of splits.

3. **Potential Cases to Test**:
   - For \( n = 1 \), the expected output is `1` (only one split with weight 1: [1]). The program might produce `1` or `2` depending on whether it counts divisors, but this is not the requisite condition.
   - For \( n = 8 \), the expected weights are {1, 2, 3, 4, 5}. Again, the program's output would be incorrect if it simply relies on counting divisors.

Considering the analysis, the program simply counts the divisors of \( n \) and does not implement the solution for counting distinct weights of splits as required by the problem statement.

Correctness: **False**. The program does not follow the problem description, as it does not compute the number of different weights of splits for \( n \).

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer input `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9) and outputs the total number of divisors of `n`. It calculates the number of divisors by iterating from 1 to the square root of `n`, counting both the divisor and its complement, while adjusting for perfect squares. It does not return a value; instead, it prints the result directly. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
