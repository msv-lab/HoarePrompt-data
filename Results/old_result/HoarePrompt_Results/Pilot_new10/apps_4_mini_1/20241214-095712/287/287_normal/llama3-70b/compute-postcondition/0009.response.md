According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to the integer value of the square root of `n`, inclusive. Since `i` is currently 1, the next value of `i` will be 2 in the next iteration. For the loop to continue executing, `i` must remain within the bounds defined by `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will increment to 2. To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to establish that `2` is still less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`.

Since `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^9\), and since `int(n ** 0.5)` will be at least 1 and at most 31622 (the integer square root of \(10^9\)), we find that the loop does have room to execute again.

To summarize, the relevant adjustments are:
- `i` will increment to 2,
- For the loop to continue, `n` must be at least 4 (as \(2 * 2 = 4\) and provides the condition for the next iteration).

Thus, the statement adjusting `n` would simply affirm that it remains within the bounds defined by the initial range.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is 2, optionally `res` remains unchanged if `2 * 2` does not equal `n`.**
