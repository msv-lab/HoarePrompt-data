The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but its previous value was 1. Therefore, the new value of `count` becomes 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `count` is 2, `i` is 1, the current value of `num` is divisible by `i`, and `i` is not equal to `num // i.**
