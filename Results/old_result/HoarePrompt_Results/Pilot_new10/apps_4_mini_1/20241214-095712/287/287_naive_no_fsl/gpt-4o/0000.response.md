Correctness: **False**

The provided program aims to count the number of different weights of splits for a given integer \( n \). However, the logic implemented in the function does not correspond to the requirements in the problem description.

The function `func_1` counts the number of divisors of \( n \) instead of determining the different weights of non-increasing splits. Here is why the program is incorrect:

1. The weights of splits are determined by how many elements in a valid split are equal to the first element. For instance, a valid split of 8 like \([5, 2, 1]\) has a weight of 2, specifically the count of '5'.
  
2. The function `func_1` uses a loop to find the divisors of \( n \), which does not relate to counting weights of splits. For any integer \( n \), the weights associated with the splits of \( n \) are not the same as the number of its divisors.

3. The expected results for ranges of \( n \) as tested with the provided examples do not match what the function produces. For instance, for \( n = 7 \), there are valid splits that yield weights {1, 2, 3, 7}, and the code does not account for this logically.

In conclusion, the program does not implement the correct logic to determine the weights of splits according to the problem description, leading to its incorrectness.
