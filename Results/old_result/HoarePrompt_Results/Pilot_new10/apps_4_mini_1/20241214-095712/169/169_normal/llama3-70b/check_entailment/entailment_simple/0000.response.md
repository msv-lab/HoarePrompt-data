To determine the correctness of the annotated program against the problem description, let's analyze the problem requirements and compare them with what the program does.

### Problem Requirements

1. Vasya performs `n` operations on a pile of stones, where:
   - `"-"` indicates taking a stone from the pile.
   - `"+"` indicates adding a stone to the pile.
2. The pile cannot be empty before a `"-"` operation.
3. We need to calculate the minimal possible number of stones left in the pile after all operations.

### Analysis of the Program

Given the key points from the problem:

- The program counts the occurrences of `"-"` (minus_count) and `"+"` (plus_count).
- It checks if the number of `"-"` operations is greater than the number of `"+"` operations:
  - If `minus_count > plus_count`, it prints `0`. This implies that if there were more stones taken than added, Vasya can have at least `0` stones left because he cannot have a negative number of stones.
  - If this condition is not met (`minus_count <= plus_count`), it prints the difference `plus_count - minus_count`.

### Evaluation of Output

1. **Case when minus_count > plus_count**:
   - This case is valid according to the problem: if Vasya took more stones than he added back, the minimum possible number of stones remaining should be `0`. The program reflects this correctly.

2. **Case when minus_count <= plus_count**:
   - In this scenario, the number of stones added is equal to or greater than the number taken. The output `plus_count - minus_count` represents the number of additional stones that Vasya has at the end of the operations. This aligns with the requirement that the minimum possible number of stones should be at least the number of excess additions compared to the subtractions.

### Conclusion

The program correctly calculates the minimal possible number of stones after performing all operations, consistently following the provided problem requirements.

Thus, the program is correct and meets the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
