Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of "-" and "+"; if the count of '-' in `s` is greater than the count of '+' in `s`, then the function proceeds with that condition. Otherwise, the printed value is the non-negative difference between the count of '+' and the count of '-' in `s` (i.e., `plus_count - minus_count`).***
