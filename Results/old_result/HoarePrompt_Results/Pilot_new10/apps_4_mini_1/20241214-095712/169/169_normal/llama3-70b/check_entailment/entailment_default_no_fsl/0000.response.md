Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not accurately calculate the minimal number of stones that can be left after the operations for all scenarios as described in the problem statement. 

For instance, the program checks if the number of '-' operations (stone removals) exceeds the number of '+' operations (stone additions). If it does, it outputs `0`, which is correct for that specific condition. However, the program fails to account for the scenario where the number of '-' is equal to or less than the number of '+', especially when the initial number of stones is less than what would be required to make all removals possible.

A specific counterexample is as follows:
- Input: 
  ```
  3
  ---
  ```
  Expected Output: `0` (which the program correctly returns)
  
- Input: 
  ```
  5
  ++-++
  ```
  Expected Output: `3` (which the program correctly returns)

However, consider this edge input:
- Input:
  ```
  4
  ---+
  ```
  The correct minimal number of stones that can be there would require the program to consider that he must start with at least `3` stones in order to take `3` stones and then add `1`, leading to an output of `1`. The current program would incorrectly return `0` because it interprets the operations in a limited sense without accounting for initial conditions.

Thus, the program does not consistently and correctly apply all the conditions of the problem statement across all potential input cases. This leads to incorrect conclusions in certain scenarios.
