According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`. Since `n` is a positive integer and `s` is defined to have a length of `n`, it ensures that `s` will contain at least one character and hence the loop can execute. 

At the start of the loop:
- `operation` will take on each character in `s`, starting from the first character.
- `stones` is initially 0, which is the state before any operations are performed.

Thus, for the loop to execute and process the characters in `s`, it should be recognized that `operation` will begin with the first character of the string. There are no additional adjustments needed for `n` or `s` since they are already defined correctly for the loop to run.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length n consisting of symbols '+' and '-' only, `stones` is 0, `operation` is the first character in s**
