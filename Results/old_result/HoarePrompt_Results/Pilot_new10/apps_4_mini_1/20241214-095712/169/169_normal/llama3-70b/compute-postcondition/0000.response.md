The code assigns a new value to `n` based on the input, converting it into an integer. The previous state specified that `n` was a positive integer within the range 1 to 100, but after executing the code, `n` will now hold the value of `int(input())`, which can also be any positive integer, potentially still within the range but not guaranteed. The variable `s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length n consisting of only the characters "-" and "+"; `n` is an input integer.**
