The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `s`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that satisfies the constraint (1 <= n <= 100). The parameter `s` is a string of length `n` that consists solely of the symbols '+' and '-'. The function processes these inputs, although specific output cases are not provided, we can summarize the functionality based on the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 <= n <= 100) and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of symbols '+' and '-'.**
