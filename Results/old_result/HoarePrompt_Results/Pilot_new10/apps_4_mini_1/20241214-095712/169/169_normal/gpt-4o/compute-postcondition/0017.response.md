The value of `stones` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not specify the previous value of `stones`, so we will acknowledge that it's now `stones + 1`. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `s` is a string of length at least 2, operation is the second character of the string `s`, `stones` is now incremented by 1.**
