Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases as per the problem description. 

For example, consider the case when `n = 2` and the input operations are `--`. 

According to the problem description:
- Vasya can only take stones if the pile is non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from it. 
- If he performs two "-" operations, it implies he needs to have at least 2 stones before starting to avoid an invalid operation.

The program checks if the number of "-" operations exceeds "+" operations and returns 0 in that case. However, it should actually calculate the minimum number of stones that Vasya could have had to start with in order to perform all operations without breaking the rule. 

The correct logic should look at the requirement that for every "-" operation, there must be a corresponding "+" operation beforehand or an initial stockpile of stones sufficient to cover the excess "-" operations.

In the test case `--`, it incorrectly produces an output of `0`, but the accurate output should indicate that for two "-" operations, at least 2 stones need to be there initially, making the final count required to be at least `2`.

Hence, the program fails to compute the minimal possible number of stones accurately, proving it incorrect.
