To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet, we start from the initial state. The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` hold floating point values based on input, and `a1` is assigned the value of `x`.

The code snippet assigns `a3` to the result of the expression `(x ** y) ** z`. Following mathematical rules, we can simplify this to `x ** (y * z)`.

No variables except for `a3` are modified in this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `a3` in terms of `x`, `y`, and `z`. The previous values remain valid and intact.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the first input floating point value, `y` is equal to the second input floating point value, `z` is equal to the third input floating point value, `a1` is equal to `x`, `a3` is equal to `x ** (y * z)`**.
