Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three space-separated real numbers (x, y, z) from user input, which are ensured to be positive and within the range [0.1, 200.0] with exactly one digit after the decimal point. This matches the problem requirements.

2. **Expression Calculation**: The program computes the twelve specific expressions that are defined in the problem (a_i) using the given numbers. The calculations are correctly implemented using Python's exponentiation operator (`**`), ensuring that the expressions follow the prescribed mathematical forms.

3. **Finding Maximum**: The program utilizes the built-in `max()` function to determine the maximum value from the list of computed expressions. It correctly identifies which expression from the list corresponds to the maximum value.

4. **Output Formatting**: The corresponding expression to the maximum value is printed in the required format as specified in the problem description. The expressions are appropriately formatted according to the requirements (e.g., using parentheses where needed).

5. **Index Handling**: In case of ties (i.e., multiple expressions evaluate to the same maximum value), the program uses the `index()` method on the list to determine the first occurrence of the maximum value, which aligns with the problem's requirement to return the expression that appears first in the specified order.

Because all aspects of the described functionality have been fully addressed by the program, it is correct and behaves as required in all potential cases defined by the problem description.
