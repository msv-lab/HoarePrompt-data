To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the initial state:

- `x` is equal to the first input floating point value.
- `y` is equal to the second input floating point value.
- `z` is equal to the third input floating point value.
- `a1` is equal to `x`.
- `a3` is equal to `x`.
- `a4` is equal to `x`.
- `a5` is equal to `y`.
- `a6` is equal to `y`.
- `a7` is equal to `y`.
- `a8` is equal to `y`.
- `a9` is equal to `z`.
- `a10` is equal to `z`.

Now, examining the code:

```
a11 = (z ** x) ** y
```

This line affects only the variable `a11`, which will be computed as follows:
- `a11` is assigned the value of `(z ** x) ** y`.
- Since we are dealing with the exponential operation, `a11` effectively becomes `z` raised to the power of `x`, and then that result raised to the power of `y`.

Other variables remain unchanged, so we need to represent that in the output state.

The output state thus reflects the unchanged state of the variables along with the newly computed `a11`.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the first input floating point value, `y` is equal to the second input floating point value, `z` is equal to the third input floating point value, `a1` is equal to `x`, `a3` is equal to `x`, `a4` is equal to `x`, `a5` is equal to `y`, `a6` is equal to `y`, `a7` is equal to `y`, `a8` is equal to `y`, `a9` is equal to `z`, `a10` is equal to `z`, and `a11` is equal to `(z ** x) ** y`.**
