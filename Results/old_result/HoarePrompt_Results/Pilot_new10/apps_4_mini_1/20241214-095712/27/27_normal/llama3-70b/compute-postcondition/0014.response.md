The list `b` is assigned various power expression strings based on the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. Importantly, the list does not change or compute any actual values; it simply stores the expressions as strings. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged since the computation has not been performed.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the first input floating point value; `y` is equal to the second input floating point value; `z` is equal to the third input floating point value; `a1` is equal to `x`; `a2` is undefined; `a3` is equal to `x`; `a4` is equal to `x`; `a5` is equal to `y`; `a6` is equal to `y`; `a7` is equal to `y`; `a8` is equal to `y`; `a9` is equal to `z`; `a10` is equal to `z`; `a11` is equal to `z`; `a12` is equal to `z`; `a` is a list containing the values `[x, a2, x, x, y, y, y, y, z, z, z, z]`; `b` is equal to the list of strings `['x^y^z', 'x^z^y', '(x^y)^z', '(x^z)^y', 'y^x^z', 'y^z^x', '(y^x)^z', '(y^z)^x', 'z^x^y', 'z^y^x', '(z^x)^y', '(z^y)^x']`.**
