The variable `a10` is assigned the value of `z` raised to the power of `y`, which is then raised to the power of `x`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are unaffected by this operation, but `a10` becomes the result of this exponential operation based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.

Thus, if we let `x`, `y`, and `z` be their respective input floating-point values, the output state will reflect that `a10` has been calculated as `z ** y ** x`.

Output State: **`x` is equal to the first input floating point value, `y` is equal to the second input floating point value, `z` is equal to the third input floating point value, `a1` is equal to `x`, `a3` is equal to `x`, `a4` is equal to `x`, `a5` is equal to `y`, `a6` is equal to `y`, `a7` is equal to `y`, `a8` is equal to `y`, `a9` is equal to `z`, `a10` is equal to `z ** y ** x`.**
