Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases correctly, specifically regarding the output format. The problem description requires the output to be formatted in a specific way, but the program has a hardcoded representation of the expressions and their associated strings. For instance, the expression `x^{y}^{z}` should be outputted as `x^y^z`, but if `max_value` and `max_expr` result from max computations based on floating-point comparisons without ensuring correct formatting of the expressions in cases where operations might result in non-intuitive precedence, it could misrepresent certain combinations.

Additionally, while the logic for calculating the maximum value from the list of expressions is acceptable, there might be nuances in how Python handles floating-point arithmetic which could lead to unexpected results when handling edge cases near the boundaries of the input constraints (like very large numbers or numbers close to 1). 

Since both formatting and possible incorrect evaluations are potential issues based on the requirements outlined, the correctness of the program cannot be guaranteed in all cases.
