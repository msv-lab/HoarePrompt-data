Correctness: **False**

The program attempts to determine if it is possible for Mishka to choose moments to switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit at any given second after the maximum of the chosen switch-on times. It calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` and checks whether this LCM is divisible by each of the intervals.

However, this approach is flawed because checking divisibility of the LCM by `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` does not directly guarantee that every second will have at least one garland lit. 

A potential counter-example is the input where `k1 = 4`, `k2 = 2`, and `k3 = 3`. 

- Here, the LCM of (4, 2, 3) is 12. 
- The program would output "YES" since 12 is divisible by 4, 2, and 3.

However, if we analyze the seconds:
- The first garland (every 4 seconds starting from x1) lights up at 0, 4, 8, 12...
- The second garland (every 2 seconds starting from x2) lights up at 0, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12...
- The third garland (every 3 seconds starting from x3) lights up at 0, 3, 6, 9, 12...

If the moments chosen are x1 = 0 (for k1), x2 = 0 (for k2), and x3 = 0 (for k3), the seconds are as follows:
- At second 1: None lit.
- At second 5: None lit.
- At second 7: None lit.
- At second 11: None lit.

Hence, there are multiple seconds after the maximum switching time where there is no garland lit, which violates the condition from the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the requirements stated in the problem, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
