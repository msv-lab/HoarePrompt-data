Correctness: **False**

The program is meant to check if there is a way to switch on three garlands so that at least one is lit during every second after the latest garland is turned on. The logic employed in the program to compute the least common multiple (LCM) using the greatest common divisor (GCD) does not correctly determine if there is a moment in time where all garlands can be lit as prescribed.

The core issue is that the program only checks if the calculated LCM is divisible by each garland's period (k1, k2, k3). This is not sufficient to guarantee that every second will be covered by at least one lit garland. 

For example, consider the input `4 2 3`:
1. LCM of (4, 2, 3) is 12. 
2. The program checks: 
   - 12 % 4 == 0 (True)
   - 12 % 2 == 0 (True)
   - 12 % 3 == 0 (True)
3. It returns "YES", which is incorrect because there are seconds (like second 1) when no garland will be lit.

Thus, the program fails to comprehensively solve the problem and correctly produce the expected output for certain inputs, leading to incorrect results.
