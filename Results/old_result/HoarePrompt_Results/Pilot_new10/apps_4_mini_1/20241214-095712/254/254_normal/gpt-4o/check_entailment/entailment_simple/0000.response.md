The given problem requires determining if it is possible for Mishka to choose switching times for three garlands such that every second after the maximum switch time at least one garland will be lit. The solution hinges on ensuring that the intervals at which these garlands light up will cover every second after the maximum switch time.

The program provided checks the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals \( k_1, k_2, \) and \( k_3 \). The output is `'YES'` if the GCD of these intervals is 1 and `'NO'` otherwise. 

However, this approach is flawed. The correct condition for ensuring that at least one garland is lit during every second after the chosen maximum switch time is not merely that the GCD is 1. 

For example, in the case of the garlands having intervals of \( k_1 = 4, k_2 = 2, k_3 = 3 \), the GCD is 1, yet there are moments (specifically when \( x = 0, 1, 2, \) and \( 3 \)) during which none of the garlands will be lit, demonstrating that the garlands do not effectively cover every second. Conversely, for \( k_1 = 2, k_2 = 2, k_3 = 3 \) having GCD 1, there are indeed times when the garlands will light appropriately across all seconds.

In summary, the algorithm checks the GCD, which does not guarantee that all seconds will be covered after the maximum switch time. Therefore, the conclusion of the function is incorrect for certain inputs that otherwise should have produced a "YES".

Correctness: **False**
