The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are integers representing time intervals of garlands, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 1500. After executing the function body, since `b` is 0, the function returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of `a` and `b`, which remains unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `a` and `b` and return the greatest common divisor of these values when `b` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters a and b, and returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a and b when b is 0.**
