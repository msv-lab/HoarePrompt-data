#State of the program right berfore the function call: a, b, and c are integers representing the time intervals of the garlands, where 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1500.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of `a` and `b`, `b` is 0. If the original value of `b` was greater than 0, the loop executed and `a` is the last non-zero value of `b` before it became zero. If the original value of `b` was 0, the loop did not execute, and `a` remains unchanged.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the original values of `a` and `b`, which remains unchanged since `b` is 0 and the loop did not execute.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and it returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the two numbers. If `b` is 0 at the start, the function returns `a` directly without entering the loop, otherwise it computes the gcd using the Euclidean algorithm. This means that it correctly identifies cases where `b` is 0 and returns `a` as the gcd without any changes.
