`gcd_k1_k2` is assigned the value of the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `k1` and `k2`. The values of `k1` and `k2` remain unchanged, but `gcd_k1_k2` now holds the result of the GCD calculation based on these inputs. Therefore, the output state is: `k1`, `k2`, `k3` are integers with values as input from the user, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`.

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, `k3` are integers with values as input from the user; `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`.**
