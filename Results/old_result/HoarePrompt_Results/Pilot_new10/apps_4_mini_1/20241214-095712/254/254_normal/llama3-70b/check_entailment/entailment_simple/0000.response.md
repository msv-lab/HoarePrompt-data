Correctness: **False**

The annotated program does not correctly follow the problem description. Here are the reasons:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem states that Mishka wants to choose times to turn on the three garlands such that from the maximum of those times onward, at least one garland is lit at every second. The program attempts to check if there exists a common time interval `lcm` that is a multiple of all three `k_i` values, but this doesn't directly solve the problem.

2. **Faulty Logic**: The condition `if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0)` checks if there exists a common multiple of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` (specifically, the least common multiple). However, this condition alone does not guarantee that garlands will cover every second after the largest starting time. The approach does not ensure that there's a sufficient overlap for consecutive seconds.

3. **Counterexample**: 
   - Consider `k1 = 4`, `k2 = 2`, and `k3 = 3`. According to the program, it calculates the lcm, which is 12 (as `lcm` is 4 * 2 * 3 divided by their gcds). However, the allowed starting times based on these intervals will leave uncovered seconds. For example, if one garland starts at 4, the second at 0, and the third at 0, from second 1 up to second 3, none of these garlands would be lit. Therefore, the choice of `x` values cannot ensure at least one garland is lit at every second.

4. **Incorrect Function Logic**: The function `func_1` is correctly implemented to compute the gcd, but it is not needed in the context of ensuring at least one garland is lit at every second.

In summary, the program misinterprets the problem's requirement by attempting to check for a common time interval without verifying actual coverage of all seconds post maximum starting time. Hence, it may result in scenarios where there is a gap (no garland lit) for some seconds, contradicting the problem's conditions.
