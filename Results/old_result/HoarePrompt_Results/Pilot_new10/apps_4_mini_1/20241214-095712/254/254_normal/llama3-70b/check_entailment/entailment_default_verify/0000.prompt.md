You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.
Program:
```
(k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))
if lcm % k1 == 0 and lcm % k2 == 0 and (lcm % k3 == 0):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze both the problem description and the implementation logic.

**Problem Description:**
The task is to switch on three garlands such that after switching them on, at least one garland is lit during every second. The garlands are lit based on their time intervals (`k1`, `k2`, and `k3`), meaning they light up at multiples of their respective intervals.

**Implementation Analysis:**
1. The program reads three integers representing the intervals of the garlands.
2. It computes the least common multiple (LCM) of the three intervals using the product of intervals divided by the greatest common divisor (GCD) for pairs.
3. The program then checks if the LCM is divisible by each interval (`k1`, `k2`, and `k3`). If it is, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

**Potential Issue:**
The current logic relies on the condition that the LCM of the three intervals must be divisible by each interval, implying there are no seconds in between that can be dark. However, **this does not guarantee light coverage from the maximum `x1`, `x2`, or `x3`**, because the LCM could simply be aligning the on/off patterns without actually covering every second continuously.

For example, consider the case:
- Input: `3 4 5`
- Calculate LCM: The LCM of 3, 4, and 5 is 60. 
- However, if you switch on:
  - `x1 = 1` for `k1`, lights at: 1, 4, 7, 10, 13, ...
  - `x2 = 1` for `k2`, lights at: 1, 5, 9, 13, ...
  - `x3 = 1` for `k3`, lights at: 1, 6, 11, 16, ...
  
From second 3 to second 5, there's no light, exposing a gap.

Since the logic about checking LCM doesn't enforce that every second is covered after the max start time is flawed in this case, it reveals a logical error.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not guarantee that there is at least one lit garland at every second after the maximum start time of the garlands as per the problem description, and thus it fails for certain inputs.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program correctly finds the LCM, but its conditional checks do not adequately ensure that after the maximum start time, every subsequent second will have at least one garland lit, leading to gaps in coverage.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and it returns the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the two numbers. If `b` is 0 at the start, the function returns `a` directly without entering the loop, otherwise it computes the gcd using the Euclidean algorithm. This means that it correctly identifies cases where `b` is 0 and returns `a` as the gcd without any changes. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
