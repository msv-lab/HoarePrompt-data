The values of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are assigned based on the input received and converted to integers. The preconditions state that `k_1`, `k_2`, and `k_3` are integers within the range of 1 to 1500. Therefore, the values of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` will take on specific integer values as determined by user input, but will remain within the constraints given.

Output State: **`k1`, `k2`, `k3` are integers with values as input from the user, satisfying 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500**.
