The function accepts three integers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` through user input. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of these integers and checks if they are pairwise coprime. If the GCD of all three integers is 1, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. There are no parameters passed to the function, and the only output is the result of the GCD check.
