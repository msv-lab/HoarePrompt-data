Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic needed to determine if Mishka can switch on the garlands such that at least one garland is lit during every second after a certain moment. The problem requires finding a combination of three integers `x1`, `x2`, and `x3` which represent the seconds at which the garlands are turned on, ensuring that for every second after `max(x1, x2, x3)`, at least one garland is lit.

The program checks only if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three time intervals `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1 to conclude whether to print "YES" or "NO". This is not sufficient for the problem statement, as two garlands with time intervals that share a common factor greater than 1 can still allow for the possibility of at least one garland being lit for every second after a certain time, depending on the choice of `x1`, `x2`, and `x3`.

For example, if `k1 = 4`, `k2 = 2`, and `k3 = 3`, the GCD is 1, yet it is impossible to light all seconds continuously after the maximum start time using those intervals alone as shown in the second example of the description. Hence, the program fails on this input, as it would erroneously provide a "YES" output due to the GCD check, while the correct answer should be "NO". 

Therefore, it does not correctly address all potential cases as required by the problem statement.
