Correctness: **False**.

The program incorrectly calculates the number of ways to split the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square. Specifically, the logic used in `func_1` is flawed. Here's why:

1. The loop iterates over possible lengths `a`, and `b` is always set to `a`. This means the two parts that are equal are always the same, which is not a direct issue but limits the combinations it will check.

2. The calculation of `rem` assumes that there will always be a way to split the remaining length evenly into two parts, but doesn't adequately cover the various possible combinations that could satisfy the conditions required to form a rectangle without forming a square.

3. The condition `if a != rem // 2` is insufficient. It's possible to miss out on combinations where `a` equals `rem // 2`, which could still lead to valid configurations of the stick.

The program fails to account for valid cutting combinations outside of the constraints defined in the provided logic, hence not covering all possible cases accurately. For example, if `n = 8`, it should recognize the configuration `{2, 2, 2, 2}` which forms a square but is excluded by the current logic, thus not yielding the expected count. 

Overall, there are edge cases where the program does not behave as expected, confirming that the correctness is indeed false.
