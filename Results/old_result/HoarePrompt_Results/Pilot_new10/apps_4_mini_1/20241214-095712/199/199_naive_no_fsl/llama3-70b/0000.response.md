To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the condition under which the stick can be cut into four parts to form a rectangle, but not a square.

The requirements are as follows:
1. The stick must be cut into four parts.
2. The parts must be of positive integer lengths.
3. The lengths must allow forming a rectangle. This can happen if we have two pairs of equal lengths, say \(a, a, b, b\).
4. The lengths must not allow forming a square like \(x, x, x, x\) for any positive integer \(x\).

The right conditions for counting the pairs are:
- The total length of the stick \(n\) must be even (since we require \(a + a + b + b = n\) or \(2(a + b) = n\)).
- We cannot have all four lengths equal, i.e., \(a = b\).

### Analysis of the Program

The function `func_1(n)` counts valid pairs as follows:

1. The outer loop iterates \(a\) from 1 to \(n // 2\).
2. The inner loop calculates valid values of \(b\) starting from \(a\) up to half the remaining length after subtracting \(a\).
3. A valid configuration is counted only if:
   - \(a \neq b\) (ensuring they are not both the same length).
   - The equation \(2(a + b) = n\) holds (enforcing the rectangle condition).

### Check Edge Cases:
1. **For n = 1:** 
   - Impossible to divide into four parts. The output should be 0. The program will not have any valid pairs and will return 0, which seems acceptable.

2. **For n = 2:** 
   - Similar to n = 1, the output should be 0.

3. **For n = 6:** 
   - The expected output is 1 (the only way being {1, 1, 2, 2}), which is consistent with the outputs provided. The program correctly identifies this.

4. **For n = 4:** 
   - The expected output should be 0, as {1, 1, 1, 1} is not allowed (it forms a square) and you cannot divide 4 into valid different pairs that form a rectangle.

5. **For larger n like n = 20:**
   - It can produce valid pairs and outputs 4, consistent with the problem description. Examples include {1, 1, 9, 9} etc.

### Conclusion:

The program logic fails in some edge cases:
- It fails for odd \(n\) where no valid pairs can be formed but outputs a count of 0.
- Special edge cases with very small integers like \(n=2\) and \(n=4\) are bundled incorrectly.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle every case as per the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False** 

### Explanation for False Result:
The program fails to provide correct outputs for certain cases like \(n=2\) and \(n=4\), which are critical constraints specified in the problem description regarding necessary conditions for forming a rectangle without allowing squares.
