The value of `ways` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is unknown. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` remain unchanged but their conditions still apply. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `a` is 2, `b` is 3, and `ways` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `a` is 2, `b` is 3, and `ways` is incremented by 1**.
