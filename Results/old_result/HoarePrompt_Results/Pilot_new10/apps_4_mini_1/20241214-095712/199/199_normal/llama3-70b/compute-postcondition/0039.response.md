The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 2·10^9. The function returns the number of distinct pairs `(a, b)` such that `2 * (a + b) = n` with the conditions that `1 ≤ a < b` and `b` being within the specified range. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the count of distinct pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given equation and constraints. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and returns the number of distinct pairs (a, b) such that 2 * (a + b) = n, with conditions 1 ≤ a < b.**
