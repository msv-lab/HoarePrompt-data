To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, we analyze the provided information:

1. The variable `n` must be at least 6, which is already specified and indicates that `n` is valid for the loop to execute.
2. The loop iterates over `b`, starting from `a` (which is 3) and ending at `(n - a) // 2 + 1`. For the loop to execute:
   - The starting value for `b` is 3 (equal to `a`).
   - The ending value for `b` is determined by `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.

Let's explore the implications of these values:
- The loop will execute if `a` (which is 3) is less than or equal to the maximum value of `b`, which is `(n - a) // 2 + 1`.
- Therefore, we need `(n - 3) // 2 + 1` to be at least 3 to ensure that `b` has a range to iterate over.

For `n = 6`:
- The maximum value of `b` would be `(6 - 3) // 2 + 1` = `1 + 1 = 2`, which is less than `a`, meaning the loop cannot execute.
  
For `n = 7`:
- The maximum for `b` = `(7 - 3) // 2 + 1` = `2 + 1 = 3`, giving a valid range from 3 to 3 (inclusive).

For `n = 8`:
- The maximum for `b` = `(8 - 3) // 2 + 1` = `2 + 1 = 3`, giving a valid range from 3 to 3 (same as above).

For `n = 9`:
- The maximum for `b` = `(9 - 3) // 2 + 1` = `3 + 1 = 4`, allowing values for `b` = 3 and 4.

For `n = 10`:
- The maximum for `b` = `(10 - 3) // 2 + 1` = `3 + 1 = 4`, similar to above.

For `n = 11`:
- The maximum for `b` = `(11 - 3) // 2 + 1` = `4 + 1 = 5`, allowing values 3, 4, 5.

As we can see, we need `n` to be greater than or equal to 9 for valid pair iteration starting with `b` at 3.

Thus, to ensure the loop will execute properly, we can summarize the state adjustments as follows:

State: **`n` must be at least 9, `a` is 3, `ways` is the number of valid pairs (3, b) such that 3 * (3 + b) == n, for `b` in range from 3 to `(n - 3) // 2 + 1`**
