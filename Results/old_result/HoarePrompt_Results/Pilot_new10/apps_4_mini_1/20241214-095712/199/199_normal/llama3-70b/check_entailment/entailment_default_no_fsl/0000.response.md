Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as specified in the problem description. The main issue lies in the fact that it does not account for quantities of parts correctly. Specifically, it only looks for pairs `(a, b)` under the condition of `2 * (a + b) = n`. 

Moreover, the program fails to consider certain cases such as when `n` is odd, which will repeatedly yield a result of zero since there cannot be two distinct integers that satisfy the condition. Even if the pairs `(a, b)` are correctly calculated for even values of `n`, the program does not account for the need to split the stick into four non-square parts, as required by the problem.

For example, for `n = 10`, a valid decomposition `2, 2, 3, 3` to form a rectangle is missed because the program only accounts for configurations where `2 * (a + b) = n`, which is insufficient to meet the rectangle formation criteria while avoiding squares. Thus, the program does not work correctly for every potential case.
