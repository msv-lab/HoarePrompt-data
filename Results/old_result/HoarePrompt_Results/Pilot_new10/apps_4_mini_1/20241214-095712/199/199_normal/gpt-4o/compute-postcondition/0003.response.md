The variable `count` is assigned the value `0`. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, and `n` is greater than or equal to 6; `count` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, and `n` is greater than or equal to 6; `count` is 0**.
