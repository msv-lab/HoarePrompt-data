Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 6; `count` is set to 1, `a` remains 1, `b` remains 1, `rem` is equal to `n - 4` and is greater than 0 and even. If the current value of `a` is not equal to `rem // 2, then `count` is updated to 1.***
