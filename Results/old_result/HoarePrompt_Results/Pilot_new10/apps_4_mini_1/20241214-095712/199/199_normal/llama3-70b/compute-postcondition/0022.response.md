The value of `ways` is incremented by 1. The previous values of the variables are not fully known, but we do know the values of `n`, `a`, and `b`, which are still valid. The updated state reflects this increment.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `a` is 2, `b` is 4, `ways` is incremented by 1.**
