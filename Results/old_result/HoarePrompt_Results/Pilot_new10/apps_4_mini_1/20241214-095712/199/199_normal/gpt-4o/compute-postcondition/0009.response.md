The value of `count` is increased by 1, since `count` was initially 0. No other variables are affected by the line of code given. Therefore, the updated variable states reflect the change in `count` only.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9, `n` is greater than or equal to 6; `count` is 1; `a` is 1; `b` is 1; `rem` is equal to `n - 4`, where `rem` is greater than 0 and `rem` is an even number; the current value of `a` is not equal to `rem // 2.**
