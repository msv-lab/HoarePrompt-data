The variable `b` is assigned the value of `a`. Since `a` has an initial value of 2, `b` will also be 2 after the assignment. Other variables such as `n`, `count`, and `rem` remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2·10^9 and `n` is greater than or equal to 8; `count` is set to 1, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `rem` is equal to `n - 4` and is greater than 0 and even.**
