The variable `max_asked` is assigned the value of `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` remain unchanged as they are not modified by this line of code. The calculation for `max_asked` depends on the values of `k` and `n`, but without specific values for these variables, we can only express `max_asked` in terms of `k` and `n`.

Therefore, the Output State depicts `max_asked` in relation to the inputs `k` and `n`, while retaining the previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the integer values from user input; `max_asked` is equal to `(k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)`**.
