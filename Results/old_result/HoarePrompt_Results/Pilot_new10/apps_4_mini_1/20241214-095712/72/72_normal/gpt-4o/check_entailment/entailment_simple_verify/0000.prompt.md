You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided annotated version to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the annotations and the problem description, determine the correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the annotations support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;

Original Assessment: To analyze the provided program, let's break down the problem requirements and verify the correctness of the implementation.

### Problem Understanding
The program aims to determine three values based on the structure of a classroom represented by rows and columns, where a specific sequence of questions is asked to the pupils:
1. The maximum number of questions any pupil is asked.
2. The minimum number of questions any pupil is asked.
3. How many times Sergei, seated at a specific position, is asked questions.

The pattern of questioning is round-robin across rows, alternating direction after reaching the topmost or bottommost row, which complicates the computations for maximum and minimum questions.

### Key Constraints
- The number of rows (n) and pupils per row (m) can be at most 100.
- The total number of questions (k) can be up to 10^18.
- We’re tasked to ensure the results match the described behavior based on the sequence of questioning.

### Code Examination
The program:
1. Computes the length of a full cycle of questions.
2. Calculates how many full cycles can fit within the total number of questions (k).
3. Determines how many questions remain after those full cycles are counted.
4. Computes the minimum and maximum questions that any pupil could have based on their seating position.
5. Iterates through the remaining questions to count how many times Sergei is asked, adjusting counts based on which row direction is being processed.

### Potential Issues
Upon reviewing the program logic:
- The handling of Sergei’s questions during both the full cycle and the remaining questions appears inconsistent, especially concerning how the full cycle is divided into row positions. 
- The inner loop does not consider that `max_questions` should be derived rightly throughout the direction switch—resulting in potentially incorrect maximum calculations.
- There might also be boundary issues, particularly edge cases where there's only one row (`n == 1`). The method might fail to handle specific edge states where not many questions are asked.

### Example Edge Case
Let’s consider an edge case:
- Input: `1 10 5 1 1`
In this case, with only one row and the number of pupils is greater than k:
- Sergei (1,1) should ideally be asked all 5 times since he’s the only pupil. 
- However, the program’s handling of cycles and segment systems may not correctly account for Sergei’s ask count and might incorrectly calculate minimum and maximum as other pupils are non-existent in this scenario.

With these considerations, the program does not account effectively for the single-row scenarios and keeps track of maximum and minimum incorrectly during question distribution, especially when cycles cannot fully complete.

### Conclusion
Considering the aforementioned analysis, I conclude that the program can give incorrect results for specific inputs, notably when there's only one row and questions requested exceed the number of pupils.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers representing the number of rows and the number of pupils in each row respectively, k is a positive integer representing the total number of questions asked, x is a positive integer indicating Sergei's row (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and y is a positive integer indicating Sergei's position in the row (1 ≤ y ≤ m).

    else :

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer.

Otherwise, `x` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` is decreased by 1, and `sergei_questions` is updated to `(full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`. In both cases, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is computed as `k % full_cycle_length`, and `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, while `max_questions` is updated to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`.
