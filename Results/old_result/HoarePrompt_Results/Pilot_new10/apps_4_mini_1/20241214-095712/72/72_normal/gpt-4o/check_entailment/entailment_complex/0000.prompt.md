You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are integers representing the number of rows and the number of pupils in each row respectively, k is a positive integer representing the total number of questions asked, x is a positive integer indicating Sergei's row (1 ≤ x ≤ n), and y is a positive integer indicating Sergei's position in the row (1 ≤ y ≤ m).
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    x -= 1
    y -= 1
    full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m if n > 1 else m
    full_cycles = k // full_cycle_length
    remaining_questions = k % full_cycle_length
    min_questions = full_cycles
    max_questions = full_cycles
    if (n > 1) :
        min_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)
        max_questions = (full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer equal to either the previous value if it was greater than 1 or 0, `y` is a positive integer equal to `y - 1`, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is an integer value equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, and `max_questions` is updated to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`.
    sergei_questions = min_questions
    if (x == 0 or x == n - 1) :
        sergei_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1
    )
    else :
        sergei_questions = (full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 *
    n - 2) >= x)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer. If `x` is 0 or `n - 1`, then `y` is decreased by 1, and `sergei_questions` is updated to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1)`. Otherwise, `x` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` is decreased by 1, and `sergei_questions` is updated to `(full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`. In both cases, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is computed as `k % full_cycle_length`, and `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, while `max_questions` is updated to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`.
    row = 0
    direction = 1
    for _ in range(remaining_questions):
        for col in range(m):
            if row == x and col == y:
                sergei_questions += 1
            if direction == 1:
                max_questions += 1
                row += direction
                if row == n:
                    direction = -1
                    row -= 2
            else:
                max_questions -= 1
                row += direction
                if row == -1:
                    direction = 1
                    row += 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is 0 or a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` is equal to its initial value minus `remaining_questions * m`, `sergei_questions` is equal to the total sum of occurrences where `(row == x and col == y)` across `remaining_questions * m` iterations, `full_cycle_length` remains equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is `0`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` reflects the total effective increments and decrements throughout all iterations, `row` could likely be `0` or `n` depending on the cumulative oscillation through the loop up and down, and `col` is equal to `m`.
    print(max_questions, min_questions, sergei_questions)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts five integer parameters: `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of pupils in each row), `k` (total number of questions asked), `x` (Sergei's row), and `y` (Sergei's position in the row). It calculates the total number of questions Sergei must answer based on his position and the cycling of rows, considering special cases for the edge rows and whether the number of questions exceeds one full cycle of rows. The function outputs the maximum and minimum questions Sergei can answer as well as the exact number of questions he must answer based on the remaining questions, without checking for invalid input scenarios (such as ensuring `x` and `y` are within the valid range).
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
