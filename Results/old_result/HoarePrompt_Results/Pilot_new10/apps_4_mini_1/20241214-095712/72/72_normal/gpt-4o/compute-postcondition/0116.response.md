Postcondition: ***If `direction` is equal to -1 and `row` is equal to `n`, then `sergei_questions` is updated if `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`, `y` is decreased by `m`, `full_cycle_length` remains equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 0, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, and `max_questions` is increased by 1 while `row` is updated to `row - 2`. If `direction` is equal to 1 or not, and `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `y` is decreased by `m`, `full_cycle_length` remains equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 0, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and `row` is updated to `row + 2` if `row` is equal to -1; otherwise, there are no modifications to the variables.***
