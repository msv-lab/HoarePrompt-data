Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is 0 or a positive integer less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` has been decreased by `m`, `sergei_questions` has been increased by 1, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` is increased by 1, if `row` is equal to `n`, then `direction` is set to -1, `row` is updated to `n - 3`, and the previous value of `row` was `n - 1`.***
