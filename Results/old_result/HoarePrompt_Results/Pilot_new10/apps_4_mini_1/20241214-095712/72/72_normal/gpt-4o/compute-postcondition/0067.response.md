Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1; `m` is greater than 1; `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`; `x` is 0 or a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`; `y` has been decreased by 1; `sergei_questions` has increased by 3; `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`; `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`; `remaining_questions` is greater than 0; `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`; `col` is 1. If `direction` equals 1, then `max_questions` has been increased by 1; if `row` equals `n`, then `row` has been decreased by 2 and `direction` is set to -1. Otherwise, if `row` equals -1, then `row` is increased by 3, while if `row` is not equal to -1, the state remains unchanged.***
