The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are assigned the values from `input`, which is processed by the `map(int, input().split())` function. The prior values of these variables are unknown, as they are being assigned new integer values from the input. Therefore, the output state reflects the change without knowing the specific values before.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `y` is a positive integer, where each of these values is now assigned from the input.**
