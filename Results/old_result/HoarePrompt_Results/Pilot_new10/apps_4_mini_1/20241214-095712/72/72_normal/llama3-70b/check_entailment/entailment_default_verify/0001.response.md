Final: **False** 

The original assessment identified key issues with the code's ability to correctly account for edge cases and how it calculates the maximum and minimum questions asked by the pupils. The use of mathematical operations in the implementation, while generally structured, does not robustly handle special scenarios, particularly when `k` is small or when there's only one row and one pupil. Thus, despite the hints provided, the program does not necessarily guarantee the correct outputs for all valid inputs as described in the problem, confirming that its correctness is indeed questionable.
