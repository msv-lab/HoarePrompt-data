You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
    min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
    sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the provided program for correctness based on the problem description, let's break down how the teacher's questioning pattern works and how the code is implemented.

**Understanding the Problem:**
- The teacher asks questions in a zigzag manner across rows. 
- For `n` rows of `m` pupils:
  1. She first asks from the 1st row, then the 2nd, ..., up to the nth row.
  2. After reaching the nth row, she reverses the order and begins from the (n-1)th row back to the 1st row, repeating this indefinitely until `k` questions are asked.

**Important Considerations:**
1. **Counting the Questions:**
   - Each full cycle consists of asking `n * m` pupils.
   - The maximum number of times any pupil can be asked would occur in a complete cycle scenario, where the remaining questions after complete cycles are also considered.

2. **Calculating Sergei's Ask Count:**
   - The position of Sergei is given in terms of row `x` and seat `y`. The implementation needs to determine how many times Sergei was asked among the `k` questions.

3. **Minimum and Maximum Counts:**
   - The maximum count is straightforward as it is dependent on the full cycles.
   - The minimum for other pupils needs to account for potential underflows when not all pupils would be asked if `k` is lower than the complete cycle.

**Evaluating the Code:**
Let's step through the calculations made in the code:

```python
max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)
min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)
```

1. **max_asked:** This is calculated as the total questions divided by the full cycle length. However, the logic of determining how many pupils would be evenly asked might miss cases especially for `n=1` or if `k` is small relative to the number of pupils.
   
2. **min_asked:** This is derived based on the maximum count, which could potentially be flawed since if `k` is small then `max_asked - (n - 1)` can lead to incorrect behavior particularly when the total students are less than `k`.

3. **sergei_asked:** This part counts how frequently Sergei is asked based on his positioning, but it appears to rely on assumptions that may not fully account for the lower indices when questions do not extend fully through the rounds.

**Potential Edge Case:**
1. Consider the case when `n = 1`, `m = 1`, and `k = 1` (only one student and one question). The expected result would be that Sergei gets asked once (2 ,1,1), but the logic of full cycles does not give a concrete guarantee for correctness.

After analyzing the approach and examples, it is reasonable that the provided program does not handle edge cases correctly and may return incorrect results due to the ceiling and math around cycles.

Therefore, the correctness of the code is in question as it does not cover all potential scenarios robustly enough.

Correctness: **False**. 

The implementation lacks coverage for special cases especially for minimal inputs that lead to unexpected results.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts five integer parameters: n (number of rows), m (number of seats), k (total questions asked), x (Sergei's row position), and y (Sergei's seat position). It computes and prints three values: the maximum number of questions asked by any student, the minimum number of questions that could have been asked by a student, and the number of questions Sergei is estimated to have asked based on his position. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
