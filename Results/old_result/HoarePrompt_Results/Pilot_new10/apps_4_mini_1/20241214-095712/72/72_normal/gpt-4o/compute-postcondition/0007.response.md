The variable `max_questions` is assigned the value of `full_cycles`, which is already determined to be an integer value equal to `k // full_cycle_length`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, and `min_questions` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `m` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer if x was greater than 1 otherwise 0, `y` is a positive integer equal to `y - 1`, `full_cycle_length` is `(2 * n - 2) * m if n > 1 else m`, `full_cycles` is integer value equal to `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is `k % full_cycle_length`, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`, `max_questions` is equal to `full_cycles`.**
