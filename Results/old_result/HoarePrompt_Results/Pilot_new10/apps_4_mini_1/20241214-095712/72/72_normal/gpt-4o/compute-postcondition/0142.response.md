Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is 0 or a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` is the previous value decreased by `m`, `col` is 0, `direction` is adjusted accordingly, `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 if `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`, `full_cycle_length`, `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, and `min_questions` retain their previous values and constraints; `max_questions` is increased by 1; `row` is increased by `direction`.**
