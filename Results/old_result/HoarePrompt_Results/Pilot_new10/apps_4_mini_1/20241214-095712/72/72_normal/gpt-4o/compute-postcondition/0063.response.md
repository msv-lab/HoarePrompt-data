Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is 0 or a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` has been decreased by 1, `sergei_questions` has increased by 3, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `col` is 1, if `row` is equal to `x` and `col` is equal to `y`, and `max_questions` is reduced by 1; `row` is increased by `direction`.**
