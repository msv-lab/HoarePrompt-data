The variable `direction` is assigned the value `-1`. This does not affect any other variables, and the values of the remaining variables remain unchanged from the initial state. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is either 0 or a positive integer less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` is the previous value decreased by `m`, `col` is 1, `max_questions` is increased by 1, `row` is increased by `-1`, `direction` is -1.**
