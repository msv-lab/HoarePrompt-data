Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is 0 or a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` has been decreased by `m`, `sergei_questions` has been increased by 1, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than or equal to 0, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` has been decreased by 1, `col` is 0, `row` is equal to `x + direction`, and `col` is equal to `y`; the value of `direction` is now 1. The current value of `row` is now equal to `x + 1`.**
