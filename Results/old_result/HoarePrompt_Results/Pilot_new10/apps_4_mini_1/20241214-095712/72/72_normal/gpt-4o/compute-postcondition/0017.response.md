Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is an integer, `k` is a positive integer. If `x` is 0 or `n - 1`, then `y` is decreased by 1, and `sergei_questions` is updated to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1)`. Otherwise, `x` is a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` is decreased by 1, and `sergei_questions` is updated to `(full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)`. In both cases, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is computed as `k % full_cycle_length`, and `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, while `max_questions` is updated to `(full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`.***
