You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to analyze the problem description, the program, and the original assessment. Use the provided output hints to systematically evaluate the program's behavior and reasoning. Based on the program, the output hints the problem description and the original assessment, determine the final correctness of the program.

Provide a final assessment of the program's correctness as follows:

If the program meets the problem description and the output hints support the correctness, output: Final: **True**
If the program does not meet the problem description, output: Final: **False**
Focus on evidence from the annotations and the original assesment to justify your conclusion. Avoid assumptions or unnecessary changes unless clearly supported by the facts.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    x -= 1
    y -= 1
    full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m if n > 1 else m
    full_cycles = k // full_cycle_length
    remaining_questions = k % full_cycle_length
    min_questions = full_cycles
    max_questions = full_cycles
    if n > 1:
        min_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)
        max_questions = (full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)
    sergei_questions = min_questions
    if x == 0 or x == n - 1:
        sergei_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1)
    else:
        sergei_questions = (full_cycles + x - 1) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= x)
    row = 0
    direction = 1
    for _ in range(remaining_questions):
        for col in range(m):
            if row == x and col == y:
                sergei_questions += 1
            if direction == 1:
                max_questions += 1
                row += direction
                if row == n:
                    direction = -1
                    row -= 2
            else:
                max_questions -= 1
                row += direction
                if row == -1:
                    direction = 1
                    row += 2
    print(max_questions, min_questions, sergei_questions)


```
Original Assessment: To determine whether the given Python program correctly fulfills the requirements set by the problem description, we need to analyze its logic, the calculations being performed, and assess whether there are any scenarios where the behavior can deviate from what is expected.

### Key Points from the Problem:
1. The teacher asks questions in a specific order based on a classroom setup (n rows, m pupils per row).
2. The counting of questions follows a zigzag pattern:
   - The first row is asked first, then the second, and so on, until the last row is reached. Direction then reverses.
3. The teacher asks a total of k questions, which complicates the understanding of how many times each pupil gets asked.
4. The program must output the maximum, minimum, and how many times Sergei is asked based on inputs x, y.

### Code Examination:
1. The function begins by adjusting indices (decreasing x and y by 1).
2. It calculates `full_cycle_length`, which represents the total number of questions asked in one complete cycle of asking all students.
3. It determines how many complete cycles occur in k questions and how many questions are remaining.
4. It initializes `min_questions` and `max_questions` to the number of full cycles.
5. The next part involves adjusting these counts based on the cycle's length and the specific row Sergei is in.
6. It then iterates through the remaining questions based on directional asking which could lead to potential flaws.

### Analyzing Edge Cases:
1. **Single Row Case**: 
   If n=1, the program sets `full_cycle_length` to m, which is expected. The program handles single row cases correctly by calculating Sergei's questions without switching directions.

2. **High k Values**: 
   Given k can be as high as 10^18, calculating everything based on loops (as done in `remaining_questions`) without optimization might be problematic. However, since any complete cycles dominate, this aspect seems correct as it correctly uses modulo calculations on cycles.

3. **Incorrect Assignment to `max_questions` and `min_questions`**:
   The program can miscalculate questions for pupils not in the edge rows when calculating questions based solely on `full_cycles`. The indexing logic for counting in the loop could potentially miss the last few questions for intermediate pupils in certain conditions.

4. **Example Input**: 
   For the input `4 2 9 4 2`, expected output is `2 1 1`. But analyzing through the complete zigzag pattern shows that questions may not be counted correctly especially with respect to pupils sitting in middle or upper rows due to how cycles are counted.

### Verdict:
The function presents logic that appears prone to error mainly in calculating minimum and maximum interactions of pupils by not thoroughly considering all edge cases. The looping mechanism to count remaining questions seems straightforward but could lead to incorrect results without more specific indexing control (especially when reversing directions).

Based on the above assessments, I have concluded:

Correctness: **False**

### Specific Case of Failure:
For input `2 2 5 1 1`, the expected count for max/min questions fails when handling row dynamics; the maximum should account cyclic requests dynamically altering per row if the full count is not accurately established navely through a single cyclic approach conflicting with reverse direction. Thus, incorrect results across various random checks indicate that the logic is flawed in cyclic calculations for maximal expectations and complex row structures undermining count stability.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts five integer parameters: `n` (number of rows), `m` (number of pupils in each row), `k` (total number of questions asked), `x` (Sergei's row), and `y` (Sergei's position in the row). It calculates the total number of questions Sergei must answer based on his position and the cycling of rows, considering special cases for the edge rows and whether the number of questions exceeds one full cycle of rows. The function outputs the maximum and minimum questions Sergei can answer as well as the exact number of questions he must answer based on the remaining questions, without checking for invalid input scenarios (such as ensuring `x` and `y` are within the valid range). 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. 
Based on the output hints, the program  and your reasoning, provide a refined assessment of the program's correctness, either mintaining the original assessment or changing it if the output hints provide a different perspective.
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
