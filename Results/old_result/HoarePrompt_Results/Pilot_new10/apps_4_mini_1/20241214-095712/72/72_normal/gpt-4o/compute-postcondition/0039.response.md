Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than 1, `m` is greater than 0, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is 0 or a positive integer greater than 0 and less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` has been decreased by 1, `sergei_questions` has been increased by 1, `full_cycle_length` is equal to `(2 * n - 2) * m`, `full_cycles` is calculated as `k // full_cycle_length`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is equal to `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)`, and `row` is updated to either `n - 2` with `direction` set to -1 if `row` equals `n`, or updated to 1 with `direction` set to 1 when `row` does not equal `n`. The `max_questions` is adjusted accordingly, either incremented by 1 or decreased by 1 based on the value of `row`.***
