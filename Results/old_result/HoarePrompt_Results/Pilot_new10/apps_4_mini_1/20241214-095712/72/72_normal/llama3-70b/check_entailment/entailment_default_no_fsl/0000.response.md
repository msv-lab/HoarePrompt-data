Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the distribution of questions among pupils based on the given problem description, particularly in scenarios where the total number of questions `k` is large. 

1. The computation for `max_asked` calculates the maximum number of questions asked by any student, but it does not account for the distribution when `k` is not a multiple of the total number of students that can potentially be asked in the complete round trip (which consists of asking every student in `n` rows in both directions).

2. The computation for `min_asked` might misrepresent the minimum number of questions posed to a student, especially in cases when `k` does not allow for every student to be asked.

3. The computation for `sergei_asked` also seems to be based on an incorrect assumption about how the questions are assigned, particularly in transitions between rounds.

For instance, when `n = 5`, `m = 5`, `k = 25`, `x = 4`, `y = 3`, the expected distribution is not captured correctly, as evidenced by the provided expected output of `1 1 1` for Sergei. The implementation does not consider the patterns that could arise when k is less than or more than the full cycles possible within the defined classroom bounds.

One can come up with large values of k, such as `k = 10^18`, which will show that the logic for distributing questions among students will lead to inconsistencies, as not every student can be asked similarly due to unequal distributions when the cycle exceeds the number of question rounds possible.

Therefore, since the program's logic fails to accurately compute the distribution in line with the provided problem description and could fail for several edge cases, it is deemed incorrect.
