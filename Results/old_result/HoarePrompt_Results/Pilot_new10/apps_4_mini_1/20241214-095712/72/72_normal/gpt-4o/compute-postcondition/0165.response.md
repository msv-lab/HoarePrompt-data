Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `k` is a positive integer greater than `full_cycle_length`, `x` is either 0 or a positive integer less than or equal to `n - 2`, `y` is the previous value decreased by `m`, `col` is 1. If `direction` is 1, then `max_questions` is increased by 1, and if `row` equals `n`, then `row` is decreased by 3 and `direction` is set to -1. Otherwise, `max_questions` is decreased by 1, and if `row` is -1, then `row` is increased by 3 and `direction` is set to 1.***
