The code assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. Since `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` is equal to `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`), this assignment does not change the values of `new_a`, `a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, `min_k`, or `candidate`. The only updated variable is `min_lcm`, which now holds the value of `current_lcm`.

Output State: **`new_a` is \((a + c - 1) // c * c\), `a` is an integer, `b` is an integer, `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b`, `k` is a positive integer, and `diff // k` is an integer; `new_b` is \((b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate\); `current_lcm` is a value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` is `current_lcm`, `min_k` is `min_k`, and `candidate` is `candidate`.**
