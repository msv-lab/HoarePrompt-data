The code updates the `current_lcm` variable by calling `func_2(new_a, new_b)`. Given the initial state, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

- `new_a` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- `new_b` remains unchanged from its initial state.
- `current_lcm` is updated to the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Since the exact implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot specify the exact value of `current_lcm`. However, we know that `current_lcm` is now the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` to its original value; `b` is an integer such that \(1 \le b \le 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\); `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`; `diff` is the absolute value of `a - b` and is at least 1; `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` (which is the value returned by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`); `min_lcm` is the least common multiple based on the first candidate `k`; `min_k` is the candidate based on the first candidate `k`; `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`; `new_b` is calculated as `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate.`, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
