Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the initial state at the end of the previous iteration:**
   - \( a \) is \( a + candidate - 1 \)
   - \( b \) is \( b + candidate - 1 \)
   - \( diff \) remains unchanged
   - \( k \) is a positive integer greater than 1
   - \( candidate \) is a factor of \( diff \)
   - \( new_b \) is \( b + candidate - 1 \)
   - \( current_lcm \) is the least common multiple of \( new_a \) and \( new_b \)
   - \( min_lcm \) is the minimum least common multiple found so far
   - \( min_k \) is the minimum \( k \) value found so far such that \( current_lcm < min_lcm \) or \( (current_lcm == min_lcm \) and \( candidate < min_k) \)

2. **Understand the loop condition:**
   - The loop iterates over the list `[k, diff // k]`.

3. **Determine the state adjustments needed for the next iteration:**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, the candidate being considered is either \( k \) or \( diff // k \).
   - For the loop to continue, the candidate must be one of these values.

4. **Adjust the states:**
   - Since the loop will continue if the candidate is either \( k \) or \( diff // k \), we need to consider both possibilities.
   - The candidate for the next iteration will be the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]`.

5. **Update the states:**
   - \( a \) and \( b \) will be updated based on the new candidate.
   - \( new_b \) will be updated as \( b + new_candidate - 1 \).
   - \( current_lcm \) will be recomputed based on the new \( new_a \) and \( new_b \).
   - If \( current_lcm < min_lcm \) or \( (current_lcm == min_lcm \) and \( new_candidate < min_k) \), then \( min_lcm \) and \( min_k \) will be updated.

6. **Final state for the next iteration:**
   - \( a \) will be \( a + new_candidate - 1 \)
   - \( b \) will be \( b + new_candidate - 1 \)
   - \( new_b \) will be \( b + new_candidate - 1 \)
   - \( current_lcm \) will be the least common multiple of \( a \) and \( new_b \)
   - \( min_lcm \) and \( min_k \) will be updated if necessary.

Given this reasoning, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop would be:

State: **`a` is `a + new_candidate - 1`, `b` is `b + new_candidate - 1`, `new_b` is `b + new_candidate - 1`, `current_lcm` is the least common multiple of `a` and `new_b`, `min_lcm` is the minimum least common multiple found so far, and `min_k` is the minimum \( k \) value found so far such that `current_lcm < min_lcm` or (`current_lcm == min_lcm` and `new_candidate < min_k`).** 

Here, `new_candidate` is the other value in the list `[k, diff // k]` that was not used in the previous iteration.
