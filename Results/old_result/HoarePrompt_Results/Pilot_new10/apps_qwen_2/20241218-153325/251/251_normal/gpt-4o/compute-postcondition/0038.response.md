The code snippet updates `dp[i]` to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]` for all `j` in the range 0 to `i-1` with `j` being 1. This means that for `j` equal to 1, `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[1] + volumes[i]`.

Since `i` is greater than 1, let's consider the general case where `i` is 2 (as `i` being 1 would not make sense in this context since `j` cannot be 1 and also within the range 0 to `i-1` which is 1 in this case).

- For `i = 2` and `j = 1`, `dp[2]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[1] + volumes[2]`.

Therefore, `dp[2]` will be updated to `max(dp[2], dp[1] + volumes[2])`.

The states of the other variables (`total` and `j`) are not affected.

Output State: **`total` is 0, `i` is greater than 1, `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`, `dp[2]` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `dp[1] + volumes[2]`.**
