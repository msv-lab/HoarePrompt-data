Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the dynamic programming approach to solve the problem. It calculates the maximum possible total volume of the special cake by considering each cake and checking if it can be placed on top of previously chosen cakes with a larger volume. The program handles all the given constraints and examples correctly. For instance, in the first example, the optimal choice is the first cake, and in the second example, the optimal choices are the first, second, and fourth cakes. The program also reads the input and outputs the result in the required format. Since no potential counterexample was found, the program is correct.
