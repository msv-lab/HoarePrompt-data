The code assigns the value of `max_speed * t` to `max_length`. Since `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, and `t` remains unchanged, the value of `max_length` will be `max(v1, v2) * t`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, and `min_speed` remain unchanged from their initial conditions.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100; `v2` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`; `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`; `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t`.**
