The code `print(total_distance)` does not change any variable's value; it simply prints the current value of `total_distance`. Therefore, the value of `total_distance` remains unchanged after executing this line of code.

Output State: **`total_distance` is the sum of all elements in `speeds`; `speeds[0]` is `v1`, `speeds[-1]` is `v2`, and for \(1 \leq i \leq a-2\), `speeds[i]` is the minimum of `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`.**
