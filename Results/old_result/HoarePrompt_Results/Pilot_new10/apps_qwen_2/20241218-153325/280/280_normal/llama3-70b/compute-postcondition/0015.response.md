`min_length` is increased by `min_speed`. The value of `min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, so `min_length` becomes `max_length + min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`min_speed` is `min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`, `max_length` is the original value of `max_length` plus `max_speed`, `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `max_length`, `min_length`, and `i` retain their initial values, `min_length` is `max_length + min(min_speed + d, max_speed)`**
