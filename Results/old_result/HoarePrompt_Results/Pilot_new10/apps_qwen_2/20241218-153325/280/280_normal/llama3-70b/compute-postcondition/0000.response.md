`v1` and `v2` are assigned the values from the input split and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The input will be two space-separated integers, which will replace the current values of `v1` and `v2`. The values of `t` and `d` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are integers such that 1 ≤ v1, v2 ≤ 100 and their new values are the integers entered by the user; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10.**
