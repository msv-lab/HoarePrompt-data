The code sets `max_speed` to the maximum value between `v1` and `v2`. The values of `v1` and `v2` are taken from user input, and `t` and `d` remain unchanged as they are not used in this line of code. After executing the line `max_speed = max(v1, v2)`, the value of `max_speed` will be the higher of the two input values `v1` and `v2`.

Output State: **`v1` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v1 ≤ 100; `v2` is an integer such that 1 ≤ v2 ≤ 100; `t` is an integer such that 2 ≤ t ≤ 100; `d` is an integer such that 0 ≤ d ≤ 10; `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`.**
