Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle the case where the speed changes are not sufficient to reach `v2` from `v1` within the given constraints. Specifically, the program calculates the speeds for each second based on the maximum allowed change `d`, but it does not ensure that the final speed is exactly `v2`. This can lead to an incorrect total distance calculation.

For example, consider the following input:
```
5 10
4 5
```

According to the problem description, the speed can change by up to 5 m/s between adjacent seconds. However, the program will calculate the speeds as follows:
- Second 1: 5 m/s (initial speed)
- Second 2: min(5 + 5, 10 + 3*5) = min(10, 25) = 10 m/s
- Second 3: min(10 + 5, 10 + 2*5) = min(15, 20) = 15 m/s
- Second 4: min(15 + 5, 10 + 1*5) = min(20, 15) = 15 m/s

The total distance calculated would be \(5 + 10 + 15 + 15 = 45\) meters, which is incorrect because the final speed should be exactly 10 m/s, not 15 m/s.

To fix this, the program needs to ensure that the final speed is exactly `v2` by adjusting the speeds appropriately.
