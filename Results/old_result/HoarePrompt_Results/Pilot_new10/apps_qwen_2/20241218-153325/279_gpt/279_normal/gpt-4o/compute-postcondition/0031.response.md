The code appends the value of `x` to the list `cycle`. Before the code runs, `x` is 1, so `cycle` is an empty list, and `x` is 1. After running the code, `cycle` will contain the value 1.

Output State: **`i` is 1, `n` is an integer within the range \(1 \leq n \leq 2 \cdot 10^5\), `cycle` is [1], `x` is 1, and `visited[1]` is True**
