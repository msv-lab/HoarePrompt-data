Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not correctly implement the given algorithm. Specifically, the logic for calculating the number of nodes visited does not account for the rules stated in the problem description, particularly the part where Amr skips commands if a destination node is already visited and returns to the parent node if he reaches a leaf node that is not the exit.

For instance, consider the input `(3, 6)`. According to the problem description, the traversal sequence should be something like `LRLLRLLR...`, and the correct number of nodes visited should be `10`. However, the provided program will not produce the correct result because it does not handle the skipping of commands and returning to the parent node properly. This can be verified by manually simulating the traversal or comparing with a correct implementation.
