`ans` is incremented by `n // 2`, which means `ans` is increased by the integer division of `n` by 2. The value of `n` must be greater than 2 before being halved, so the value of `n` is divided by 2 and the result is an integer. The variable `h` remains unchanged as it was not affected by the code. The output state is therefore: `h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` must be greater than 2 before being halved; `ans` is updated accordingly.

Output State: **`h` is an integer such that 1 ≤ h ≤ 50; `n` must be greater than 2 before being halved; `ans` is updated accordingly; `ans` = `ans` + (`n` // 2)**
