Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly handle the case where the array already contains all integers from 1 to \( n \). Specifically, the code sorts the array and iterates through it to find the smallest positive integer that is not present. However, if the array already contains all integers from 1 to \( n \), the loop will break prematurely, and the mex value will be 1 instead of \( n + 1 \).

For example, consider the input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```

The code will sort the array to [1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and then iterate through it. Since all integers from 1 to 5 are present, the loop will break without incrementing `mex`, resulting in `mex` being 1, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 6.

To fix this, the code should check if the array contains all integers from 1 to \( n \) before breaking the loop and setting `mex` to \( n + 1 \). Hereâ€™s an updated version of the code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.sort()
    mex = 1
    has_all_elements = True
    
    for num in arr:
        if num == mex:
            mex += 1
        elif num > mex:
            break
        else:
            has_all_elements = False
    
    if has_all_elements:
        mex = n + 1
    
    print(mex)

func()
```

With this modification, the code will correctly identify the mex value even if the array contains all integers from 1 to \( n \).
