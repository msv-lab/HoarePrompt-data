`mex` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The values of `n`, `arr`, and `num` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `arr` is a non-empty list containing at least one element, `mex` is 2, and the current value of `num` is equal to `mex`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `arr` is a non-empty list containing at least one element, `mex` is 2, and the current value of `num` is equal to `mex`.**
