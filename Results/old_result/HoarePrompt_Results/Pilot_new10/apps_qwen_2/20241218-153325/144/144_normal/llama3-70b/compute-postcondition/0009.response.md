The code `break` does not change any variable values; it only breaks out of the nearest loop or switch statement. Since there is no loop or switch statement in the given code snippet, it means that the `break` statement will simply cause the program to exit the context it was used in (which could be a loop or a switch, depending on the surrounding code). However, since the exact context is not provided, we assume it's a loop, and the loop is exited.

Given the initial state and the fact that no variables are modified by the `break` statement, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `arr` must contain at least one element, `mex` is 1, `num` is not equal to `mex`, and the current value of `num` is greater than 1**
