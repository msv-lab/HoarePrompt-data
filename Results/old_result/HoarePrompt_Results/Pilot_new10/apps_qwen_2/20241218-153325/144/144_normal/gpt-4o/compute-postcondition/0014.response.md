Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), `mex` is the smallest integer greater than any element in the list `a`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initial State:**
   - `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\).
   - `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\).
   - `mex` is initially 1.

2. **Loop Operation:**
   - The loop iterates over each element `num` in the list `a`.
   - If `num` is greater than or equal to `mex`, `mex` is incremented by 1.

3. **Analysis of Loop Execution:**
   - As the loop runs, `mex` will keep incrementing until it reaches the smallest integer that is not present in the list `a`.
   - This means `mex` will eventually be the smallest integer greater than any element in the list `a`.

4. **Final State:**
   - After the loop finishes executing, `mex` will be the smallest integer greater than any element in the list `a`.
   - The length of the list `a` and its contents do not change within the loop, so `a` remains a sorted list of `n` integers.

5. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `a` contains all integers from 1 to `n`, `mex` will be `n+1` after the loop completes.
   - If `a` is empty, `mex` will start at 1 and remain 1 since there are no elements to compare.

Thus, the final state of the variables after the loop executes all iterations is that `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers where each integer \(a_i\) satisfies \(1 \leq a_i \leq 10^9\), `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100,000\), and `mex` is the smallest integer greater than any element in the list `a`.
