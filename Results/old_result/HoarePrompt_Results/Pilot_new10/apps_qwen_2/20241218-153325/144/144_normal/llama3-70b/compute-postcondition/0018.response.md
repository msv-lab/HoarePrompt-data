`mex` is incremented by 1. Given that `mex` is either 1 or 2, if `mex` was 1, it will become 2, and if `mex` was 2, it would go out of the valid range of 1 or 2, which means it will remain as 2 since it cannot exceed 2. The values of `n` and `arr` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1; `arr` is a non-empty list containing at least two elements; `mex` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1; `arr` is a non-empty list containing at least two elements; `mex` is 2**
