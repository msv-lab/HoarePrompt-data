Correctness: **True**

The code provided is a simple Python function `func_1(n)` that checks the parity of a given number `n`. It uses the modulo operator `%` to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0, it means the number is odd, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`. 

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1(12) == False`, `assert func_1(7) == True`, and `assert func_1(10) == False`, demonstrate the function's correctness for both even and odd numbers. 

Additionally, the output hints describe the function's behavior accurately, stating that it returns `True` for odd inputs and `False` for even inputs, which aligns with the code's implementation. 

Given the code and the problem description, there are no obvious edge cases that the code does not handle. The function should work correctly for all integer inputs, whether positive, negative, or zero, because the modulo operation in Python can handle these cases as expected (e.g., `(-5) % 2 == -1`, which is not equal to 0, correctly identifying -5 as an odd number). 

Therefore, based on the information provided, the code correctly implements the function as described in the problem, and there's no reason to believe it would fail for any potential integer case.
