Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` checks whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd by using the modulus operator `%`. The expression `n % 2!= 0` evaluates to `True` if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not zero, indicating an odd number, and `False` otherwise, indicating an even number.

This function correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. It correctly returns `True` for odd numbers and `False` for even numbers, as demonstrated by the provided unit tests. The function does not have any apparent edge cases or missing logic that would cause it to produce incorrect results.

In particular, the function works correctly for:

* Positive integers: `func_1(7)` returns `True` and `func_1(12)` returns `False`.
* Negative integers: The function also works correctly for negative integers, e.g., `func_1(-7)` returns `True` and `func_1(-12)` returns `False`.
* Zero: The function correctly returns `False` for zero, since zero is an even number.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and meets the problem description for all potential cases.
