The original assessment is None, indicating that there is no initial assessment to evaluate. However, we can assess the program's correctness based on the problem description and the provided output hints.

The problem description asks to write a Python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers.

The program uses the modulo operator (`%`) to check if the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0. This is a correct and efficient way to determine if a number is odd.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, it appears that the program is correct and meets the requirements.

Final: **True**
