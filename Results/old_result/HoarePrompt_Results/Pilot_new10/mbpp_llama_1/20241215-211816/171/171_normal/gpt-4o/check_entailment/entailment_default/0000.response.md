Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given code defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns a boolean value indicating whether `n` is odd. The function uses the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the remainder is not equal to 0 (`n % 2!= 0`), the function returns `True`, indicating that `n` is odd. Otherwise, it returns `False`, indicating that `n` is even.

The provided output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even, for any integer input. The given unit tests also support this, demonstrating that the function behaves correctly for both odd and even inputs.

The function's logic is sound, as the modulo operator correctly identifies whether a number is odd or even. There are no apparent edge cases that would cause the function to behave incorrectly. Therefore, based on the provided information, it appears that the code correctly implements the problem description and should work as expected for all potential cases.
