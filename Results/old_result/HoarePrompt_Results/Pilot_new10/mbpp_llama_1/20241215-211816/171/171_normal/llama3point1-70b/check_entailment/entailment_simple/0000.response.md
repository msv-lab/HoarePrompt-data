Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly determines whether the parity of a given number `n` is odd. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function takes an integer `n` as input.
2. Inside the function, the expression `n % 2!= 0` checks whether the remainder of `n` divided by 2 is not equal to 0. In mathematics, this is equivalent to checking whether a number is odd.
3. If `n` is odd, `n % 2` will be 1, and the expression `n % 2!= 0` will evaluate to `True`. If `n` is even, `n % 2` will be 0, and the expression will evaluate to `False`.
4. The function returns the result of this expression, which is `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even.

This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks to write a function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
