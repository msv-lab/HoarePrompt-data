To determine the output state, we first need to understand what the given Python code snippet does. The code `return n % 2!= 0` checks if the remainder of the division of `n` by 2 is not equal to 0. In simpler terms, it checks if `n` is an odd number. If `n` is odd, the expression `n % 2!= 0` evaluates to `True`; if `n` is even, it evaluates to `False`.

Given that `n` is an integer, we can have two scenarios:
1. `n` is even (e.g., 0, 2, 4,...), which means `n % 2 == 0`, so `n % 2!= 0` is `False`.
2. `n` is odd (e.g., 1, 3, 5,...), which means `n % 2!= 0`, so the expression is `True`.

Therefore, the program returns a boolean value indicating whether the integer `n` is odd or not.

Output State: **The program returns True if n is odd and False if n is even**
