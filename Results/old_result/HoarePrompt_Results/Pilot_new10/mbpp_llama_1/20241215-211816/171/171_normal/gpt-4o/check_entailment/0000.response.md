Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it correctly checks whether the parity of a given number is odd. The function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if the number `n` is odd and `False` if it's even. The expression `n % 2!= 0` evaluates to `True` for odd numbers (since the remainder of an odd number divided by 2 is 1, which is not equal to 0) and `False` for even numbers (since the remainder of an even number divided by 2 is 0).

This logic applies to all integers, both positive and negative, since the modulus operator `%` in Python returns the remainder of the division, which is always non-negative for positive numbers and negative for negative numbers. However, the `!= 0` condition correctly handles negative numbers as well.

For example, `func_1(7)` returns `True` because 7 is an odd number, and `func_1(10)` returns `False` because 10 is an even number. The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function works as expected.

No potential cases can be found where the program does not work as described, so the program is considered correct.
