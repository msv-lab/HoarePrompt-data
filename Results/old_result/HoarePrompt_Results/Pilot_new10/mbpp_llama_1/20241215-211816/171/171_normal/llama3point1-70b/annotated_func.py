#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 != 0
    #The program returns True if n is an odd integer, False if n is an even integer
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer, `False` if `n` is an even integer, working correctly for all integer values including positive, negative, and zero.
