The original assessment is None, meaning there is no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. To determine the final correctness of the program based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, let's analyze the information available:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd.
2. **Program**: The provided Python function `func_1(n)` uses the modulo operator (`%`) to find the remainder of the division of `n` by 2. If the remainder is not 0, it returns `True`, indicating the number is odd.
3. **Original Assessment**: None, providing no prior judgment on the program's accuracy.
4. **Annotated Version**: The annotations explain that the function takes an integer `n`, and returns `True` if `n` is odd (i.e., `n % 2!= 0`) and `False` if `n` is even. The state of the program before the function call is that `n` is an integer, and it's assumed the input will always be valid.

Given this analysis, the annotated version of the code accurately describes the functionality of the provided Python function. The function correctly determines whether a given integer is odd, fulfilling the problem description's requirements. The assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty integer) does not affect the function's correctness for the specified domain of input values.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the final assessment of the program's correctness is that it accurately solves the problem as stated.

Final: **True**
