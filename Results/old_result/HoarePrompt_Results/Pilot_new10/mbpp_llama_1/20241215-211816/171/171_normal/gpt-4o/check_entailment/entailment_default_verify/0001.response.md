The original assessment is None, which means there was no initial assessment provided. 

However, based on the problem description, the given code, and the output hints, we can evaluate the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks for a function to determine whether the parity of a given number is odd. The code defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` for odd inputs and `False` for even inputs.

Therefore, based on the provided information, the program appears to be correct.

Final: **True**
