To determine the final correctness of the program, let's analyze the information provided step by step:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd.
2. **Original Program**:
    ```python
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2!= 0
    ```
3. **Original Assessment**: None. This implies there was no initial judgment on the program's correctness.
4. **Annotated Version of the Program**:
    ```python
# State of the program right before the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2!= 0
    # The program returns True if n is an odd integer, False if n is an even integer
# Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer, `False` if `n` is an even integer, working correctly for all integer values including positive, negative, and zero.
    ```
    
From the annotated version, it's clear that the program correctly identifies whether an integer `n` is odd or even by using the modulus operator (`%`). If `n % 2` equals 0, then `n` is even; otherwise, `n` is odd. This logic applies to all integers, including negative numbers and zero.

Given the problem description and the annotated program, the original lack of assessment does not affect the program's inherent correctness regarding the task at hand. The provided Python function correctly determines the parity of an integer.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the problem description, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:
Final: **True**
