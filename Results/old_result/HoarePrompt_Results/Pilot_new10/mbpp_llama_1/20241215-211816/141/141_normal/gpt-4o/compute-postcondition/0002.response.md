According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digit_str`. If `digit_str` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`, for the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer with at least one digit, meaning `digit_str` must have at least one character. At the start of the loop, `frequency` is an empty dictionary and `digit` is the first character in `digit_str`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer with at least one digit, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n` that must have at least one character, `frequency` is an empty dictionary, `digit` is the first character in `digit_str`**
