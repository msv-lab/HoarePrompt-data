Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself. The function works by converting the integer to a string, then iterating over each digit in the string. For each digit, it counts the occurrences of the digit in the string using the `count` method and compares it to the digit itself, converted back to an integer.

This approach correctly implements the problem description. The function returns `False` as soon as it finds a digit whose frequency exceeds the digit itself and returns `True` if it checks all digits without finding such a case.

To verify the correctness, consider the following cases:
- If the input integer `n` has no repeating digits (e.g., 123), the function will return `True` because the count of each digit is 1, which is less than or equal to the digit itself.
- If the input integer `n` has repeating digits but the count of each digit does not exceed the digit itself (e.g., 111), the function will also return `True` because the count (3) is less than or equal to the digit (1 in this case) is not true, however the return value should be False for this example.
- For `n = 111`, str_n.count('1') is 3 which is greater than int('1') which is 1, so the function returns False as expected.

However, this example 111 (or any other similar examples) is handled correctly by the code as the function checks every potential case that the description says.

Therefore, the function is correct according to the given problem description, and it handles all potential cases as expected.
