Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input processing**: The program takes an integer `n` as input and converts it to a string `digit_str` to process each digit individually.

2. **Frequency calculation**: The program uses a dictionary `frequency` to count the occurrence of each digit in the input integer. This is done by iterating over each character `digit` in `digit_str`. If the digit is already in the `frequency` dictionary, its count is incremented; otherwise, it is added with a count of 1.

3. **Validation**: After calculating the frequency of each digit, the program checks if the count of any digit exceeds its integer value. This is done by iterating over the key-value pairs in the `frequency` dictionary and comparing the count (value) with the integer value of the digit (key).

4. **Return condition**: If any digit's frequency exceeds its integer value, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such condition, the function returns `True`, indicating that the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to its integer value.

The program's logic aligns with the problem description, covering all potential cases:

- It correctly handles non-negative integers by processing each digit's frequency relative to its numeric value.
- The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's behavior with different inputs, showcasing its ability to validate the frequency condition correctly.

Since the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles the specified input cases as expected, it is deemed correct.
