The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the function returns either `True` or `False` based on certain conditions. 

Since there are four cases and all but one return `False`, it can be inferred that the function has a specific condition that must be met to return `True`. However, the exact conditions for each case are not specified. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return a boolean value (`True` or `False`) based on the value of `n`, with `True` being returned for one specific case and `False` for all other cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `True` for one specific case; otherwise, it returns `False`.**
