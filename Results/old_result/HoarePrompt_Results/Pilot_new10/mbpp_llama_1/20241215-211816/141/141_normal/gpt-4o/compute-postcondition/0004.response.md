The value of `frequency[digit]` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `n` is a non-negative integer with at least one digit, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary, and `digit` is the first character in `digit_str` which is a key in `frequency`. 

The states of `n`, `digit_str`, and `digit` are not affected. The only change is in the value of `frequency[digit]`, which is increased by 1. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer with at least one digit, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n` that must have at least one character, `frequency` is a dictionary where `digit` is a key and its value is one more than before, `digit` is the first character in `digit_str`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer with at least one digit, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n` that must have at least one character, `frequency` is a dictionary where the value of `frequency[digit]` is `frequency[digit] + 1`, `digit` is the first character in `digit_str`.**
