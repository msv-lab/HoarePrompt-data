The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and converts it into a string `str_n`. It then iterates over each digit in `str_n`, checking if the count of that digit in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of the digit. If such a condition is found, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any such condition, the function returns `True`, indicating that for every digit in the string representation of `n`, its count in the string is less than or equal to its integer value.

Upon examining the code, it does exactly what the annotations describe. There are no obvious edge cases or missing logic that the annotations do not cover, given the specific task the function is designed to perform. The function handles non-negative integers as specified, and the condition for returning `False` is clearly defined and implemented. The function does not handle negative integers, as they are outside its specified input domain, but this is consistent with the provided annotations.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, checks if the count of each digit in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to its integer value, and returns `True` if this condition holds for all digits; otherwise, it returns `False`. **
