Correctness: **True**

The given code correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

- The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n`, converts it into a string `str_n`, and then iterates over each character (digit) in the string.
- For each digit, it counts the occurrences of that digit in the string representation of the integer using `str_n.count(digit)`.
- It then checks if the count of occurrences of the digit is greater than the integer value of the digit itself (`int(digit)`).
- If for any digit, the count of occurrences exceeds the digit's value, the function immediately returns `False`.
- If the function iterates through all digits without finding any that exceed their value when counted, it returns `True`, indicating that the condition is met for all digits.

This logic accurately reflects the problem description, which requires that for each digit in the integer, the frequency of that digit should be less than or equal to the digit itself.

The output hints provided align with how the function operates. They correctly describe the function's behavior without indicating any discrepancies or edge cases that the function fails to handle. 

Therefore, the code is correct and handles every potential case as specified in the problem description.
