The variable `digit_str` is assigned the value of `n` converted to a string using the `str()` function. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n`**
