Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case when the input is a negative integer or a non-integer. According to the problem description, the function should take an integer as input, but it does not specify what to do with negative integers or non-integers. However, the output hints mention that there might be undefined behavior for these cases, and indeed, the code does not check for the type or sign of the input.

For example, if we call `func_1(-1234)`, the function will throw an error because the negative sign '-' is not a digit and cannot be converted to an integer. Similarly, if we call `func_1(123.4)`, the function will treat the decimal point '.' as a character and return incorrect results.

To fix this issue, the code should add input validation to check if the input is a non-negative integer and raise an error or return a specific value if it's not. 

Here is a simple modification to handle non-negative integer inputs:
```python
def func_1(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer")
    digit_str = str(n)
    frequency = {}
    for digit in digit_str:
        if digit in frequency:
            frequency[digit] += 1
        else:
            frequency[digit] = 1
    for (digit, count) in frequency.items():
        if count > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```
