Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer with at least one digit, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n` that must have at least one character, `digit` is the first character in `digit_str`. The dictionary `frequency` is updated based on the presence of `digit` as a key: if `digit` was already a key in `frequency`, its value is incremented by 1; otherwise, `digit` is added as a new key with a value of 1.***
