The code updates the `frequency` dictionary by adding the `digit` as a key with a value of 1. The previous values of `n`, `digit_str`, and `digit` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer with at least one digit, `digit_str` is a string representation of `n` that must have at least one character, `frequency` is a dictionary with the first digit of `digit_str` as a key and 1 as its value, `digit` is the first character in `digit_str`**
