To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze its behavior based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

The problem description asks for a function that removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. The provided function, `func_1`, attempts to achieve this by finding the indices of the first and last occurrences of the character `ch` in the string `s`.

Here's a breakdown of how `func_1` works:
1. It first finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s` using the `find` and `rfind` methods, respectively.
2. If `ch` appears less than twice in `s` (i.e., `first_index == last_index`), or if `ch` is not found in `s` (i.e., `first_index == -1` or `last_index == -1`), the function simply returns the original string `s`. This is because there are not enough occurrences to remove both the first and the last `ch`.
3. If `ch` appears more than once in `s` and both the first and last occurrences have valid indices (i.e., `first_index!= -1`, `last_index!= -1`, and `first_index!= last_index`), the function returns a modified string derived from `s`. However, the critical part here is how it constructs this modified string: `s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]`. This line of code not only removes the first and last occurrences of `ch` but also removes all characters between these occurrences, excluding the first and last `ch` themselves.

Based on this analysis, the given Python program **does not** meet the requirements of the problem description. The issue lies in the way it handles the removal of characters between the first and last occurrences of `ch`. According to the problem description, the function should only remove the first and last occurrences of `ch`, not the characters between them.

Therefore, the program fails to follow the problem description for every potential case where `ch` appears more than once in `s` and there are characters between the first and last occurrences of `ch`.

Correctness: **False**
