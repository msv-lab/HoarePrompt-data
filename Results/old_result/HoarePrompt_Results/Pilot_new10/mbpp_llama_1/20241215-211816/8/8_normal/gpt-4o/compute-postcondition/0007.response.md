The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. According to the annotated code, if `ch` appears more than once in `s`, it returns a string derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed, along with any characters between these occurrences (excluding the first and last `ch` themselves). However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the function actually returns the original string `s` if `ch` does not appear at least twice in `s`, or if `ch` is not found in `s` at all. 

The code checks for the condition where `first_index` or `last_index` equals -1 (indicating that `ch` is not found in `s`) or where `first_index` equals `last_index` (indicating that `ch` appears only once in `s`). In these cases, it returns the original string `s`. 

However, there's an assumption in the annotations that `ch` exists at least once in `s`, but the code actually handles cases where `ch` may not exist in `s` at all. The code also handles cases where `ch` appears only once in `s`. 

Therefore, considering all potential edge cases and the actual logic implemented in the code, the functionality of the function can be accurately summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and returns either the original string `s` if `ch` appears less than twice in `s`, or a modified string derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` and the substring between them removed (excluding the first and last `ch` themselves) if `ch` appears more than once in `s`. **
