Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string. After analyzing the function, it appears to correctly handle various edge cases and follows the problem description for every potential case.

Here are the key points that support the correctness of the function:

1. **Handling missing characters**: If the given character is not found in the string, the function returns the original string, which is the correct behavior. This is achieved by checking if `first_index` or `last_index` is -1.

2. **Handling single occurrence**: If the given character appears only once in the string, the function returns the string with that single character removed. This is handled implicitly by the conditions in the function.

3. **Handling multiple occurrences**: If the given character appears multiple times in the string, the function correctly removes the first and last occurrences.

4. **Preserving the order**: The function preserves the order of characters in the string by using slicing operations to exclude the first and last occurrences of the given character.

5. **Handling edge cases**: The function seems to correctly handle edge cases, such as an empty string or a string with only one character.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the function, as they cover various scenarios and do not raise any `AssertionError`.

Since the function appears to work correctly for all potential cases, and no counterexample could be found, the conclusion is that the code is correct.
