The given code simply returns the string `s`. According to the initial state, `s` is a string, and `ch` is a single character string that exists at least once in `s`, but based on the conditions provided, there are two possible scenarios for `ch` in `s`: either `ch` does not exist in `s` or `ch` exists only once in `s`. However, these conditions about `ch` do not affect the value of `s` itself.

Output State: **The program returns string `s`.**
