#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and ch is a single character string that exists at least once in s.
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns string `s`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string that exists at least once in `s`, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`. Additionally, `first_index` is not equal to -1, `last_index` is not equal to -1, and `first_index` is not equal to `last_index`, meaning that `ch` appears more than once in `s` and both the first and last occurrences of `ch` have valid indices.
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns a string that is derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed, along with any characters between these occurrences (excluding the first and last `ch` themselves).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and returns either the original string `s` if `ch` appears less than twice in `s`, or a modified string derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` and the substring between them removed (excluding the first and last `ch` themselves) if `ch` appears more than once in `s`.
