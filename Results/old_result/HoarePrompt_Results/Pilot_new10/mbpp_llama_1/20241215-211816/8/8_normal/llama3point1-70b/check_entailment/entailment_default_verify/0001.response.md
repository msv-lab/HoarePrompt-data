To assess the correctness of the provided Python program, let's break down the information given:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string.
2. **Program**: The provided function `func_1` attempts to achieve this by finding the first and last occurrences of the character in the string and then reconstructing the string without these occurrences.
3. **Original Assessment**: None, meaning there's no initial evaluation to build upon or contradict.
4. **Output Hints**: These hints describe the expected behavior of the function, which aligns with the problem description. The function should remove the first and last occurrences of a character if it appears more than once in the string; otherwise, it should return the original string.

Given the problem description, the program, and the output hints, the key aspects to evaluate are:

- **Correctness in Handling Multiple Occurrences**: The program checks if the first and last occurrences of the character are not equal, indicating multiple occurrences. It then correctly removes these occurrences by slicing the string.
- **Correctness in Handling Single Occurrence**: If the character appears only once, the `find` and `rfind` methods will return the same index. The program handles this by replacing the character only once using `s.replace(char, '', 1)`, effectively removing the single occurrence.
- **Correctness in Handling No Occurrences**: If the character does not appear in the string, both `find` and `rfind` return `-1`. The program correctly handles this by returning the original string.

Considering these points, the provided program correctly implements the required functionality as described in the problem statement and the output hints. The original assessment being "None" implies there's no pre-existing judgment to agree or disagree with. However, based on the analysis, it's clear that the program is correctly designed to solve the problem as stated.

**Final: True**
