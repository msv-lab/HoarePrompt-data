To determine the output state, let's break down the given return statement and the initial state.

The return statement is: `return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]`

Given:
- `s` is a string.
- `ch` is a single character string that exists at least once in `s`.
- `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`.
- `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`.
- `first_index` is not equal to -1, indicating that `ch` is found in `s`.
- `last_index` is not equal to -1, for the same reason.
- `first_index` is not equal to `last_index`, meaning `ch` appears more than once in `s`.

The return statement concatenates three parts of the string `s`:
1. `s[:first_index]`: This part of the string includes everything before the first occurrence of `ch`.
2. `s[first_index + 1:last_index]`: This part includes everything after the first occurrence of `ch` up to but not including the last occurrence of `ch`. Note that the character at `first_index` (the first `ch`) and the character at `last_index` (the last `ch`) are excluded.
3. `s[last_index + 1:]`: This part includes everything after the last occurrence of `ch` to the end of the string.

Given that `ch` appears more than once and both the first and last occurrences have valid indices, the returned string effectively removes the first and last occurrences of `ch` from `s`, along with any characters between these occurrences (excluding the first and last `ch` themselves).

Output State: **The program returns a string that is derived from `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed, along with any characters between these occurrences (excluding the first and last `ch` themselves).**
