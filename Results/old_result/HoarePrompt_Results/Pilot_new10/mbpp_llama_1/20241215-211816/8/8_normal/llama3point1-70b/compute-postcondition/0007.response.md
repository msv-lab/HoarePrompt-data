Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, and `last_occurrence` is the index of the last occurrence of `char` in `s`, which is equal to `s.rfind(char)`. Either `first_occurrence` is -1 or `last_occurrence` is -1, or both are -1, meaning `char` is not present in `s` at least twice, or not present at all, resulting in `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` not being valid indices of `char` in `s`**
