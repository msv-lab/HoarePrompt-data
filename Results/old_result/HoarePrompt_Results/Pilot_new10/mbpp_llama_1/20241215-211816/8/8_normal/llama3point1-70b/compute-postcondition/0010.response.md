The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a character `char`. The function searches for the first and last occurrences of `char` in `s` using the `find` and `rfind` methods.

If `char` is not found in `s` or found only once, the function returns the original string `s`.

If `char` appears more than once in `s`, the function checks if the first and last occurrences are the same. However, this condition is not possible since `char` appears more than once, so this condition will always be false when `char` appears more than once.

If `char` appears more than once in `s`, the function returns a new string where the first and last occurrences of `char` are removed.

However, there is a potential issue with the code. The line `return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]` assumes that `first_occurrence` is less than `last_occurrence`. If `char` appears more than twice in `s` and the first occurrence is not the smallest index, this line may not produce the expected result.

Additionally, the annotations mention that `char` is a character that is present at least twice in `s`, but the code does not check for this condition explicitly. If `char` appears only once in `s`, the function will still return the original string `s`.

Considering all potential cases, the functionality of the function is to remove the first and last occurrences of `char` from `s` if `char` appears more than once, and return the original string `s` otherwise.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a character `char`, and returns a new string where the first and last occurrences of `char` are removed if `char` appears more than once in `s`, or the original string `s` if `char` appears once or not at all in `s`. **
