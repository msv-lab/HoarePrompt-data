Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function seems to be correct as it handles the removal of the first and last occurrence of a given character from a string properly. 

Here are some key points that indicate the correctness of the function:

1. The function uses `find()` to get the index of the first occurrence of the character and `rfind()` to get the index of the last occurrence.

2. It checks if the character is not found in the string (in which case both `find()` and `rfind()` return -1) and handles this case correctly by returning the original string.

3. It also handles the case when the first and last occurrences are the same (i.e., when the character appears only once in the string), again by returning the original string.

4. When the character appears multiple times, it correctly removes the first and last occurrences.

No potential cases were found where the program does not work as expected according to the given problem description. Therefore, the function seems to be correct for all possible inputs.
