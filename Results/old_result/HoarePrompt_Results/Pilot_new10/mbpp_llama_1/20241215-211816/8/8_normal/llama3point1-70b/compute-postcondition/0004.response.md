Given the initial state, we know that `s` is a string, `char` is a single character present at least twice in `s` (but due to the conditions provided, it's actually present only once), `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`, and both are not -1. The code `return s.replace(char, '', 1)` will replace the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with an empty string, effectively removing it.

Since `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence` and is not -1, it means `char` appears only once in `s`. Thus, replacing the first occurrence of `char` (which is also the last occurrence due to it being the only one) with an empty string will result in a new string where `char` is completely removed from `s`.

Output State: **The program returns a string where the single occurrence of `char` has been removed from `s`.**
