Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The problem description asks for a function to find the area of a rectangle, which is calculated by multiplying the length and width of the rectangle. 

The provided function `func_1` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, and returns their product, which is the correct formula for calculating the area of a rectangle. 

Additionally, the problem description states that the input numbers `length` and `width` are non-negative, which is a valid assumption for the dimensions of a rectangle. In this case, the function will always return a non-negative number, which is consistent with the expected result for the area of a rectangle.

There are no potential cases where the function would not follow the problem description because the area of a rectangle is always calculated by multiplying its length and width, and the function does exactly that. Therefore, the function is correct and always meets the requirements in the problem description.
