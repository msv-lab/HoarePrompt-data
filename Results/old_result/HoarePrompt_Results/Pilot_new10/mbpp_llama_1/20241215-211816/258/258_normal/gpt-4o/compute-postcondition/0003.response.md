To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the return statement.

Given:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is a string representation of `n`.
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`.
- `armstrong_sum` equals the sum of each digit in `n` raised to the power of `num_len`.

The return statement is `return armstrong_sum == n`. This statement checks if `armstrong_sum` is equal to `n`.

Since `armstrong_sum` is the sum of each digit in `n` raised to the power of `num_len` (the number of digits in `n`), the comparison `armstrong_sum == n` essentially checks if `n` is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits.

Output State: **The program returns True if `n` is an Armstrong number (i.e., `n` equals the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`), and False otherwise.**
