The code snippet introduces a new variable `sum` and initializes it to 0. The initial state's variables `num`, `num_str`, and `num_len` are not directly affected by this operation.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is equal to the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is 0**
