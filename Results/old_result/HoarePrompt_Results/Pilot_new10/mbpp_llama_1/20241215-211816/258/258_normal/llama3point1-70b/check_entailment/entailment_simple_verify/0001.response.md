The problem description asks to write a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits, which means each digit is raised to the power of 3.

The original assessment claims that the provided function is correct. However, the function raises each digit to the power of the total number of digits in the number (`num_len`), not just to the power of 3.

The annotated version of the code supports this observation, explaining in detail how the loop calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the total number of digits in `num`. This is not in line with the definition of an Armstrong number, which requires each digit to be raised to the power of 3, not the number of digits.

Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate because the provided function does not correctly implement the definition of an Armstrong number. It incorrectly raises each digit to the power of the number of digits in the number instead of raising it to the power of 3.

Final: **False**
