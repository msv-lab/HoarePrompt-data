To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides:
- `num` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is the string representation of `num` with at least three digits.
- `num_len` is at least 3.
- `sum` is the sum of the integer values of the first two digits of `num`.

The code given is:
```
sum += int(digit) ** num_len
```

However, there seems to be a missing part in the code provided, as `digit` is not defined anywhere in the initial state or the code snippet. For the sake of providing a meaningful analysis, let's assume `digit` represents the last digit of `num` (or any specific digit, but for simplicity, we'll consider it as the last digit).

Given this assumption:
- The value of `sum` is updated by adding the result of `int(digit)` raised to the power of `num_len`.
- The integer value of `digit` (assuming it's the last digit of `num`) raised to the power of `num_len` (which is at least 3) will result in a value that is then added to `sum`.
- The states of `num`, `num_str`, and `num_len` are not affected by this operation.

Considering the specific values and conditions provided:
- `num` remains a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` remains the string representation of `num` with at least three digits.
- `num_len` remains at least 3.
- `sum` becomes the original sum of the first two digits of `num` plus the result of the last digit (or the specific digit considered) raised to the power of `num_len`.

Therefore, the output state, considering the adjustments and assumptions made, is:
Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` with at least three digits, `num_len` is at least 3, `sum` is the sum of the integer values of the first two digits of `num` plus `int(digit)` raised to the power of `num_len`.**
