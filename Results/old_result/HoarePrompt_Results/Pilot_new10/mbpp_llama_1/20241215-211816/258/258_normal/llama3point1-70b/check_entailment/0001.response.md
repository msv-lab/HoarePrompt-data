Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` checks whether a number is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes of its digits. For example, 371 is an Armstrong number since 3*3*3 + 7*7*7 + 1*1*1 = 371.

The function works by first converting the input number to a string, then calculating the length of the string (i.e., the number of digits in the number). It then iterates over each digit in the string, raises it to the power of the number of digits, and adds it to a running sum. Finally, it checks if the sum is equal to the original number, and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise.

This function appears to be correct for all potential cases. It handles numbers with different numbers of digits correctly, and it correctly identifies Armstrong numbers and non-Armstrong numbers. 

For example, `func_1(371)` returns `True`, because 371 is an Armstrong number (3*3*3 + 7*7*7 + 1*1*1 = 371). On the other hand, `func_1(123)` returns `False`, because 123 is not an Armstrong number (1*1*1 + 2*2*2 + 3*3*3 = 32, not 123).

Overall, the function seems to be working correctly for all potential cases, so the correctness is **True**.
