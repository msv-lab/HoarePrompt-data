To determine the adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `num` is a non-negative integer.
- `num_str` is the string representation of `num`.
- `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`.
- `sum` is the sum of the integer values of the digits in `num` (calculated as `int(digit)` for each digit in `num_str`).

For loop statement:
```python
for digit in num_str:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute one more time, it needs to have another character (digit) in `num_str` to iterate over. 

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `num` remains the same because the loop doesn't modify `num` directly; it iterates over the string representation of `num`.
- `num_str` would logically be the same string as at the start of the previous iteration because the loop iterates over this string, not modifying it.
- `num_len` must be greater than the number of digits that have been processed so far for the loop to continue. Since we are considering the state at the end of one iteration, it implies at least one digit has been processed. Thus, for the loop to execute again, `num_len` must be at least 2 or more because we've already processed the first digit (assuming the first digit was processed in the previous iteration).
- `sum` would be the sum of the integer value of the digits processed so far. Since we are looking at the state after one iteration, `sum` would be the integer value of the first digit (if we consider the loop starts from the first digit of `num_str`).

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `num` remains a non-negative integer, as it's not directly modified by the loop.
- `num_str` still represents `num` but must have more than one digit for the loop to continue.
- `num_len` must be at least 2 for the loop to have another iteration (since one digit has been processed).
- `sum` will be the sum of the integer values of all digits up to but not including the next digit to be processed.

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is the string representation of `num` with at least two digits, `num_len` is at least 2, `sum` is the sum of the integer values of the first digit(s) of `num`.**
