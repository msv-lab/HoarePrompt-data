You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1(n)` checks whether the given number `n` is an Armstrong number or not. An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of cubes (or any other power) of its digits. In this case, the function checks if the number is equal to the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in the number.

The function works by first converting the number to a string, then calculating the length of the string (which represents the number of digits in the number). It then uses a generator expression to calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits. Finally, it checks if this sum is equal to the original number.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the function. 

This function handles all potential cases correctly. It works for both positive and negative numbers (although Armstrong numbers are typically defined for positive integers, if the input is negative, the function will still work correctly and return `False`, because the negative number will not be equal to the sum of its digits raised to any power). If the input is a non-integer, the function will throw an error, but this is a reasonable behavior because Armstrong numbers are defined only for integers.

The function also handles the edge cases of single-digit numbers and zero correctly. A single-digit number is always an Armstrong number, because it is equal to its only digit raised to the power of 1. Zero is also an Armstrong number, because 0 is equal to 0^1. The function correctly identifies these numbers as Armstrong numbers. 

Therefore, the function is correct, and it works as expected for all potential cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)
    return armstrong_sum == n
    #The program returns True if `n` is an Armstrong number (i.e., `n` equals the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`), and False otherwise.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
