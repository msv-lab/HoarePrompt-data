The original assessment is accurate because the provided code implements the definition of an Armstrong number correctly. It checks if a given number is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits, which is the definition of an Armstrong number. The code uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of each digit raised to the power of `num_len`, which is the correct approach.

The output hints provided also confirm the correctness of the code, as they match the problem description and the code's functionality. The hints state that the function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns True if `n` is an Armstrong number, and False otherwise, which is exactly what the code does.

The original assessment correctly concludes that the code is correct based on the provided unit tests and the logic of the code. The code handles numbers of any length and correctly identifies Armstrong numbers.

Therefore, after reviewing the problem description, the provided code, the original assessment, and the output hints, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
