#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [(2 * i) for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum(x ** 3 for x in even_numbers)
    return cube_sum
    #The program returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to 2n, where n is a positive integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to `2n`, handling positive integers as expected, returning 0 for `n` equal to 0, and potentially handling negative integers and non-integer values by returning 0 or truncating `n` to the nearest integer, respectively.
