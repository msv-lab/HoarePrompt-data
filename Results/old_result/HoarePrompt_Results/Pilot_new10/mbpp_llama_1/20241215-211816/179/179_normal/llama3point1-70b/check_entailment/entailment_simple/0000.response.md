To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to check if it accurately calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers as per the problem description.

The problem description asks for the sum of the cubes of the first n even natural numbers. Even natural numbers start from 2, so the first n even natural numbers would be 2, 4, 6,..., 2n.

The provided function `func_1(n)` uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to calculate the sum of the cubes of even numbers from 2 to 2n (inclusive) for a given positive integer n. The `range` function generates numbers from 2 to 2n (inclusive) with a step of 2, ensuring only even numbers are considered.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Start from the first even natural number (2):** The `range` function starts from 2, which is the first even natural number, meeting the requirement.
2. **Consider all even numbers up to 2n:** The `range` function goes up to `n * 2 + 1`, ensuring that 2n is included in the calculation because the upper limit in `range` is exclusive. Therefore, by adding 1, we ensure 2n is included when n is an integer.
3. **Calculate the cube of each number:** The expression `i ** 3` calculates the cube of each even number `i`.
4. **Sum the cubes:** The `sum` function adds up all these cubes to give the total cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

Given that the function correctly implements the calculation for the sum of the cubes of the first n even natural numbers, we can conclude that it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
