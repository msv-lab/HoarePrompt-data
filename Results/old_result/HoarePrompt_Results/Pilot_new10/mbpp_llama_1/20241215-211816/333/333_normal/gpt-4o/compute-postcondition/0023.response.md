Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and has at least one more character after the first character has been removed, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets. If the current character `char` is a value in `matching_pairs`, then `char` is added to the `stack`. If `char` is a key in `matching_pairs`, then if the `stack` is empty or the top of the `stack` does not match `char` according to `matching_pairs`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program continues execution without returning False, and the `stack` remains unchanged for this case. If `char` is neither a key nor a value in `matching_pairs`, the program continues execution without returning False or modifying the `stack`.***
