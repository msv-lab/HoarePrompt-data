Postcondition: **`expression` is a non-empty string containing characters, `char` is the first character in `expression`, `stack` is a list, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'} and `char` is not a key in the `brackets` dictionary. The current value of `char` is one of the values in the `brackets` dictionary, meaning it is either ')' or '}' or ']'. The stack is not empty and the last opening bracket in the stack matches the current closing bracket `char`, i.e., `brackets[stack[-1]] == char` or after popping the last element from the stack, the popped opening bracket matches the current closing bracket `char`, i.e., `brackets[stack.pop()] == char`**
