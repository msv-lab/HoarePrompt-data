The original assessment is None, which doesn't provide any information about the correctness of the program. However, we can make our own assessment based on the problem description and the provided code.

The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `expression` as input and checks if all brackets are properly matched and balanced. It uses a stack to keep track of the opening brackets and checks if the corresponding closing brackets match.

The output hints suggest that the function should return True if all brackets are properly matched and balanced, and False otherwise. This aligns with the problem description.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears to correctly implement the logic for checking balanced brackets. It correctly handles cases where closing brackets do not match their corresponding opening brackets, or where there are unmatched opening brackets at the end of the string.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, I believe the program is correct.

Final: **True**
