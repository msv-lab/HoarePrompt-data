The code `stack.append(char)` adds the value of `char` to the end of the `stack` list. 

The initial state has the following conditions:
- `expression` is a string containing at least one more character.
- `char` is the second character in `expression`.
- `stack` is a list.
- `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}. 
- If `char` is a key in the `brackets` dictionary, `stack` contains the value of `char`.
- If `char` is a value in the `brackets` dictionary, either the stack is empty, or it is not empty and the last opening bracket in the stack matches the current closing bracket `char`, or after popping the last element from the stack, the popped opening bracket matches the current closing bracket `char`.
- If `char` is neither a key nor a value in the `brackets` dictionary, the state of the program remains unchanged.

The code `stack.append(char)` adds `char` to the stack. This operation does not change the values of `expression`, `char`, or `brackets`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`expression` is a string containing at least one more character, 
`char` is the second character in `expression`, 
`brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}. 
`stack` is the original list with `char` added to the end. 

If `char` is a key in the `brackets` dictionary, the new `stack` contains the value of `char` at the end. 
If `char` is a value in the `brackets` dictionary, the new `stack` either ends with the corresponding opening bracket of `char` or does not, depending on the original state of the stack. 
If `char` is neither a key nor a value in the `brackets` dictionary, the new `stack` simply contains `char` at the end, which does not match any opening bracket.

Output State: **`expression` is a string containing at least one more character, `char` is the second character in `expression`, `stack` is the original list with `char` appended to it, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}.**
