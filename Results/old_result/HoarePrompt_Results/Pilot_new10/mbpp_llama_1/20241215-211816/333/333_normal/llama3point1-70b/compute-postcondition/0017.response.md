Postcondition: ***`expression` is a string containing at least one more character, `char` is the second character in `expression`, `stack` is a list, and `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}. If `char` is a key in the `brackets` dictionary, `stack` contains the value of `char` appended to it. If `char` is a value in the `brackets` dictionary, either the stack is empty, or it is not empty and the last opening bracket in the stack does not match the current closing bracket `char`, the program returns False. If the stack is not empty and the last opening bracket in the stack matches the current closing bracket `char`, or after popping the last element from the stack, the popped opening bracket matches the current closing bracket `char`, the state of the program remains unchanged. If `char` is neither a key nor a value in the `brackets` dictionary, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
