Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly checks if a given expression is balanced or not, as described in the problem description. 

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. It correctly handles the cases where a closing bracket does not match its corresponding opening bracket. This is achieved by checking if the closing bracket `char` matches the expected closing bracket for the last opening bracket in the stack (`brackets[stack.pop()]!= char`).

2. It correctly handles the cases where there are unmatched opening brackets at the end of the string. This is achieved by returning `False` if the stack is not empty after iterating over the entire string (`return not stack`).

3. The program correctly uses a stack data structure to keep track of the opening brackets encountered so far. This allows it to efficiently match each closing bracket with its corresponding opening bracket.

4. The program iterates over the entire string `expression`, ensuring that all brackets are considered.

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem description:

- It returns `True` if all brackets are properly matched and balanced.
- It returns `False` if there are any unmatched opening brackets at the end of the string.
- It returns `False` if a closing bracket does not match its corresponding opening bracket.

Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
