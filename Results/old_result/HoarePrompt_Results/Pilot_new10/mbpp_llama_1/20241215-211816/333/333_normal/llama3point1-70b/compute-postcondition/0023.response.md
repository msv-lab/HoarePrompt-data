Postcondition: **`expression` is a string containing at least one more character, `char` is the third character in `expression`, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}}. If `char` is an opening bracket, `stack` is a list containing its original elements and `char` at the end. If `char` is a closing bracket, either the function returns False if the stack is empty or the top of the stack does not match the character, or the stack is updated by popping the top element if it matches. If `char` is neither an opening nor a closing bracket, the state of `stack` remains unchanged.**
