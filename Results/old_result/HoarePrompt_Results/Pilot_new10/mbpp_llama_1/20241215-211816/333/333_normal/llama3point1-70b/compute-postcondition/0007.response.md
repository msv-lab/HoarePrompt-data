Postcondition: **`expression` is a non-empty string containing characters, `char` is the first character in `expression`, `stack` is a list, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'} and `char` is not a key in the `brackets` dictionary. The current value of `char` is one of the values in the `brackets` dictionary, meaning it is either ')' or '}' or ']'. The stack is either empty or if it is not empty, the last opening bracket that was pushed onto the stack does not match the current closing bracket `char`.**
