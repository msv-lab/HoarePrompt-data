According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `expression`. If `expression` has at least one more character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `expression` has at least one more character, `char` is the second character in `expression`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `expression` must have at least one more character after the second character and `char` is the third character in `expression`. The state of `stack` remains unchanged as its state is determined by the bracket matching logic inside the loop, and the state of `brackets` also remains unchanged as it is a constant dictionary.

State: **`expression` is a string containing at least one more character, `char` is the third character in `expression`, `stack` is a list, and `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}}**
