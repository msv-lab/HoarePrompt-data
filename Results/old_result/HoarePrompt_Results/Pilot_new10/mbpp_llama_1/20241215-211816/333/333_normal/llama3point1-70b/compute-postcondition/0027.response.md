The function func_1 accepts a string parameter `expression` containing characters used in expressions, such as parentheses, brackets, and braces. It iterates through each character in the string, using a stack to keep track of the opening brackets encountered. If it encounters a closing bracket that does not match the last opening bracket in the stack, or if the stack is empty when it encounters a closing bracket, it immediately returns False. After iterating through the entire string, it checks if there are any unmatched opening brackets left in the stack and returns False if there are, indicating that the brackets in the expression string are not balanced. Otherwise, it returns True, indicating that the brackets are balanced.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `expression` and returns True if all brackets are properly matched and balanced, and False otherwise, considering cases where closing brackets do not match their corresponding opening brackets, or where there are unmatched opening brackets at the end of the string **
