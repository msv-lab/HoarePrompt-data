Postcondition: **`expression` is a non-empty string containing characters, `char` is the first character in `expression`, `stack` is an empty list, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'} and `char` is not a key in the `brackets` dictionary. The current value of `char` is one of the values in the `brackets` dictionary, meaning it is either ')' or '}' or ']'**
