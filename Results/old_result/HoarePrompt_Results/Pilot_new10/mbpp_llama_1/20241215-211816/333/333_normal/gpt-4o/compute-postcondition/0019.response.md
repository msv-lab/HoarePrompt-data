To understand the impact of the code on the program, let's analyze it step by step. The code `stack.append(char)` adds a character to the end of the stack. However, the initial state does not specify what `char` is or what the initial state of `stack` is. 

Given the initial state, `expr` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and has at least one more character after the first character has been removed. `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets where ')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'. 

The code provided does not directly modify `expr` or `matching_pairs`. It implies the use of a `stack` and a `char` variable, which are not defined in the initial state. However, based on the context, we can infer that `char` might be a character from `expr`, and `stack` is likely being used to keep track of opening brackets or braces from `expr`.

Assuming `char` is a character from `expr` and `stack` is initially empty or not specified, after executing `stack.append(char)`, the `stack` will contain the character `char`. The state of `expr` and `matching_pairs` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `expr` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and has at least one more character after the first character has been removed, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets where ')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', and `stack` contains the character `char`.

Output State: **`expr` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces and has at least one more character after the first character has been removed, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets where ')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', and `stack` contains the character `char`.**
