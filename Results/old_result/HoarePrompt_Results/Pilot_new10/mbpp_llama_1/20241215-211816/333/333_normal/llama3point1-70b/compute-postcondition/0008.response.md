Given the initial state, we know that `expression` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character in `expression` and is one of the closing brackets (')', '}', or ']'), `stack` is a list that is either empty or its last element does not match `char`, and `brackets` is a dictionary defining the matching brackets.

The code simply returns `False`, indicating that the brackets in the `expression` are not balanced, given the conditions on `char` and `stack`.

Output State: **The program returns False, indicating that the brackets in the expression string are not balanced, because the current character is a closing bracket that does not match the last opening bracket in the stack, or the stack is empty.**
