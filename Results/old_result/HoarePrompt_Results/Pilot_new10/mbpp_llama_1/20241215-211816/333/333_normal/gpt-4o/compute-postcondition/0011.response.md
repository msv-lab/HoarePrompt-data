Postcondition: ***`expr` is a non-empty string containing parentheses, brackets, or braces, `stack` is a list, `matching_pairs` is a dictionary containing the matching pairs of brackets where ')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{', and `char` is the first character in `expr`. If `char` is one of the opening brackets '(', '[', or '{', `stack` contains one element which is the opening bracket `char`. If `char` is one of the closing brackets ')', ']', or '}', the stack is not empty and the top element of the stack matches the corresponding opening bracket of the current character, or the state remains unchanged if `char` is not a bracket.***
