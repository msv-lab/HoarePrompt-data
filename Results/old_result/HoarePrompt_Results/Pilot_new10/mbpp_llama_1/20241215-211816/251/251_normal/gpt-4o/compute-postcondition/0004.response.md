The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, both real numbers. It calculates the non-negative distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` in the Cartesian plane using the formula `r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`, and the angle `theta` in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)` using the `math.atan2` function.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the function does not handle the case where `x` or `y` is `NaN` (Not a Number) or infinity, which could lead to incorrect results. Additionally, the function assumes that the input values are real numbers, but it does not perform any error checking to ensure this.

Considering the actual code, we can see that it correctly calculates the distance `r` and angle `theta` for all valid input values, including edge cases such as `(0, 0)`, `(0, y)`, and `(x, 0)`. The `math.atan2` function also correctly handles the case where `x` is zero.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, calculates the non-negative distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` and the angle `theta` in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)`, and returns these values; however, it may produce incorrect results for invalid input values such as `NaN` or infinity, and it assumes that the input values are real numbers without performing any error checking. **
