Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It calculates the polar coordinates from the given rectangular coordinates and returns the distance `r` and the angle `theta` in radians.

The program uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` using the formula `r = sqrt(x^2 + y^2)`. It then uses the `math.atan2` function to calculate the angle `theta` in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)`.

The program handles the conversion correctly for all real number inputs, including those where `x` or `y` is zero, and returns the correct values of `r` and `theta`. The `math.atan2` function is used instead of `math.atan` to handle the case where `x` is zero, which would cause a division by zero error.

However, as mentioned in the annotations, the program does not perform any error checking for invalid input values such as `NaN` or infinity, which could cause incorrect results. Nevertheless, the problem description does not explicitly require handling such cases, so the program is correct according to the given description.

One potential improvement could be to add error checking to handle such invalid inputs, but based on the provided problem description, the program meets the requirements and is therefore correct.
