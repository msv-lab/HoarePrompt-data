You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
import math

assert func_1(3, 4) == (5.0, 0.9272952180016122)
assert func_1(4, 7) == (8.06225774829855, 1.0516502125483738)
assert func_1(15, 17) == (22.67156809750927, 0.8478169733934057)

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are real numbers.
def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)
    theta = math.atan2(y, x)
    return r, theta
    #The program returns `r`, the non-negative distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)` in the Cartesian plane, and `theta`, the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)`, where `r = math.sqrt(x
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, calculates the non-negative distance `r` from the origin to the point `(x, y)` and the angle `theta` in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)`, and returns these values; however, it may produce incorrect results for invalid input values such as `NaN` or infinity, and it assumes that the input values are real numbers without performing any error checking.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
