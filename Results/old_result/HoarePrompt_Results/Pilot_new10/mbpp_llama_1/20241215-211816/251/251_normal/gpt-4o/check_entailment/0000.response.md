Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, appears to be correct in converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It uses the `math.sqrt` function to calculate the radial distance `r` and the `math.atan2` function to calculate the angle `theta`.

The `math.atan2` function is used instead of `math.atan` to handle the case where `x` is 0, which would cause a division by zero error. The `math.atan2` function also returns the correct angle in the range of `-pi` to `pi`, which is more accurate for polar coordinates.

The function returns a tuple containing the radial distance `r` and the angle `theta`, which is in line with the problem description.

All the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) pass, which suggests that the function works correctly for the given inputs.

After reviewing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the function would not work as expected. The function handles positive and negative values of `x` and `y` correctly, as well as the case where `x` or `y` is 0. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
