Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. It uses the `math.hypot` function to calculate the radial distance `r` and the `math.atan2` function to calculate the angle `phi`. 

The `math.hypot` function calculates the Euclidean norm, which is the square root of the sum of the squares of the input values, and is equivalent to the formula `math.sqrt(x**2 + y**2)`. This is the correct formula for calculating the radial distance in polar coordinates.

The `math.atan2` function calculates the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point `(x, y)`. It handles the case where `x` is zero correctly, which is important because the `math.atan` function does not.

The function handles all possible input cases, including:

- The origin (0, 0), where `r` is 0 and `phi` is arbitrary, though `math.atan2(0, 0)` returns 0.
- The positive x-axis, where `y` is 0 and `phi` is 0.
- The negative x-axis, where `y` is 0 and `phi` is `pi`.
- The positive y-axis, where `x` is 0 and `phi` is `pi/2`.
- The negative y-axis, where `x` is 0 and `phi` is `-pi/2`.
- All other points in the plane, where `x` and `y` are non-zero.

In all these cases, the function should return the correct polar coordinates. Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct.
