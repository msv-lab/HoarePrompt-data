To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code step by step:

1. The initial state is: `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `a` is 1, `b` is 3.
2. The code `a, b = b, a + b` simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`.
3. Before the update, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3.
4. The new value of `a` will be the old value of `b`, which is 3.
5. The new value of `b` will be the sum of the old values of `a` and `b`, which is 1 + 3 = 4.
6. The value of `n` is not affected by this code, so it remains a non-negative integer larger than 2.

Therefore, after executing the code, the output state is:
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
