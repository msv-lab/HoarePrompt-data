The original assessment states that the program is correct for calculating the n'th Lucas number. However, upon examining the annotated version of the code, it becomes apparent that the program is actually calculating the n'th Fibonacci number, not the Lucas number. 

The annotated code states that after the for loop has been executed, `a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci number and `b` is the nth Fibonacci number. This is inconsistent with the problem description, which asks for the n'th Lucas number. 

The Lucas sequence and the Fibonacci sequence have similar recursive formulas, but they have different initial values. The Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, while the Lucas sequence starts with 2 and 1. The provided code correctly implements the initial values of the Lucas sequence (2 and 1), but the annotated code reveals that it is actually calculating the Fibonacci sequence.

Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate. The program is not correct for calculating the n'th Lucas number as it is actually calculating the n'th Fibonacci number.

Final: **False**
