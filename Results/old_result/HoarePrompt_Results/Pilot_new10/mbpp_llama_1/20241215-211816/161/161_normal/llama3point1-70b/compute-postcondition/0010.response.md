To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 1, `b` is 3.

The code is: `a, b = b, a + b`.

Now, let's break down what this code does:

1. `a` is assigned the value of `b`, which is 3.
2. `b` is assigned the value of `a + b`. Since `a` is 1 and `b` is 3 before this operation, `a + b` equals 1 + 3 = 4.

After the execution of the code:

- The value of `a` changes to 3 (the initial value of `b`).
- The value of `b` changes to 4 (which is the sum of the initial values of `a` and `b`).
- The value of `n` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, `a` is 3, `b` is 4**
