To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop code and the provided output states.

The loop code is:
```python
for _ in range(2, n + 1):
    a, b = b, a + b
```
This is a Fibonacci sequence generator, where `a` and `b` are the last two numbers in the sequence.

From the output states, we can see that:

* After 1 iteration, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3, which means the sequence has started with 2 and 1 (initial values of `a` and `b`).
* After 2 iterations, `a` is 3 and `b` is 4, which means the sequence has continued with 3 and 4.
* After 3 iterations, `a` is 4 and `b` is 7, which means the sequence has continued with 4 and 7.

We can see that the loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 1. If `n` is 1, the loop will not execute, and `a` and `b` will remain 2 and 1, respectively.

After all iterations, `a` and `b` will hold the last two numbers in the Fibonacci sequence up to the `n`-th number. Specifically, `b` will hold the `n`-th Fibonacci number, and `a` will hold the `(n-1)`-th Fibonacci number.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci number, `b` is the nth Fibonacci number**
