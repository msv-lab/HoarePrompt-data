The given code swaps the values of `a` and `b` and then adds the original value of `a` to the new value of `b`. Initially, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1. 

So, `a` becomes `b` which is 1, and `b` becomes `a + b` which is 2 + 1 = 3.

The state of `n` is not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is 1, `b` is 3**
