Correctness: **True**

The code provided implements a function to find the n'th Lucas number, which is a modified Fibonacci-like sequence where the 0th term is 2 and the 1st term is 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding ones. 

The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` as input and returns the n'th term in this sequence. It correctly handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively. For `n > 1`, it initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the first two terms (2 and 1) and then iteratively calculates the next term as the sum of the previous two, updating `a` and `b` in each iteration.

The loop runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive), ensuring that after the loop completes, `b` holds the n'th term of the sequence, which is then returned. This approach correctly follows the definition of the Lucas sequence for all non-negative integers `n`.

Given that the output hints align with this explanation, providing examples that match the expected behavior (e.g., returning 2 for `n = 0`, 1 for `n = 1`, and correctly calculating subsequent terms), there are no identified cases where the program fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
