You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the n'th lucas number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        (a, b) = (2, 1)
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            (a, b) = (b, a + b)
        return b


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1(n)` to calculate the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, with the first two numbers being 2 and 1, and each subsequent number being the sum of the previous two.

The function uses a simple iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number. The base cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1` are correctly handled, returning 2 and 1 respectively.

For `n > 1`, the function uses a loop to iteratively calculate the Lucas numbers up to the n'th number. The loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n + 1` (since the range function in Python is exclusive of the end value). In each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to `b` and `a + b` respectively, effectively calculating the next Lucas number.

The function finally returns the value of `b`, which is the n'th Lucas number.

After analyzing the code, it appears to be correct for all potential cases. It correctly handles the base cases, and the iterative approach ensures that the n'th Lucas number is calculated correctly for any positive integer `n`. 

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0) :
        return 2
        #The program returns 2
    else :
        if (n == 1) :
            return 1
            #The program returns 1
        else :
            a, b = 2, 1
            for _ in range(2, n + 1):
                a, b = b, a + b
                
            #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci number, `b` is the nth Fibonacci number
            return b
            #The program returns the nth Fibonacci number


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
