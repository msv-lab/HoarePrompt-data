The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. 

Let's analyze the code step by step: 

- If `n` equals 0, the function returns 2. 
- If `n` equals 1, the function returns 1. 
- If `n` is larger than 1, the function calculates the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1.

The code seems to be correctly implementing the Fibonacci-like sequence for `n` larger than 1, and the base cases for `n` equals 0 and 1 are also correctly handled.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to return the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1 for a given non-negative integer `n`, where the first two numbers in the sequence are 2 and 1, and each subsequent number is the sum of the previous two.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, where `n` equals 0 returns 2, `n` equals 1 returns 1, and for `n` larger than 1, it returns the nth number in the sequence **
