Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1(n)` to calculate the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, with the first two numbers being 2 and 1, and each subsequent number being the sum of the previous two.

The function uses a simple iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number. The base cases for `n == 0` and `n == 1` are correctly handled, returning 2 and 1 respectively.

For `n > 1`, the function uses a loop to iteratively calculate the Lucas numbers up to the n'th number. The loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n + 1` (since the range function in Python is exclusive of the end value). In each iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are updated to `b` and `a + b` respectively, effectively calculating the next Lucas number.

The function finally returns the value of `b`, which is the n'th Lucas number.

After analyzing the code, it appears to be correct for all potential cases. It correctly handles the base cases, and the iterative approach ensures that the n'th Lucas number is calculated correctly for any positive integer `n`. 

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
