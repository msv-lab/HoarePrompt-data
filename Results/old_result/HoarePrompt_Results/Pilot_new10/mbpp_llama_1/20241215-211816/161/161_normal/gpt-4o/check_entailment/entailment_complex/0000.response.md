Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function to find the nth Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1.

The provided program implements this correctly by returning the following values:

- For `n == 0`, it returns 2, which is the first Lucas number.
- For `n == 1`, it returns 1, which is the second Lucas number.
- For `n > 1`, it calculates the nth Lucas number using a recursive formula (`a, b = b, a + b`), which is similar to the Fibonacci sequence but with the initial values of 2 and 1.

The program's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all non-negative integer inputs. The provided assertions (`assert func_1(9) == 76`, `assert func_1(4) == 7`, `assert func_1(3) == 4`) also validate its correctness for specific inputs.

In summary, the program meets the problem description's requirements, and its logic is correct for all potential cases, making it a correct implementation of a function to find the nth Lucas number.
