The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns a value based on a modified Fibonacci-like sequence where the 0th term is 2, the 1st term is 1, and each subsequent term is the sum of the two preceding ones, thus returning 2 for `n = 0`, 1 for `n = 1`, and the `n`th term of this sequence for `n > 1`.
