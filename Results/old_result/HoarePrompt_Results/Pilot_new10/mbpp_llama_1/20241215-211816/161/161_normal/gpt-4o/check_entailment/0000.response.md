Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(n)` calculates the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas sequence is similar to the Fibonacci sequence, but it starts with 2 and 1 instead of 0 and 1. The function uses an iterative approach to calculate the n'th Lucas number.

Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. It handles the base cases where `n` is 0 or 1, returning 2 and 1 respectively.
2. For `n > 1`, it initializes two variables `a` and `b` with the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1).
3. It then enters a loop that runs from 2 to `n` (inclusive), updating `a` and `b` in each iteration to hold the last two Lucas numbers calculated so far.
4. After the loop finishes, `b` holds the n'th Lucas number, which is then returned.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also confirm that the function works correctly for certain inputs. The function's logic is sound and correctly implements the Lucas sequence calculation. 

Therefore, based on the given code and problem description, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases, and no example can be found where the program does not work as expected.
