To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the output states after the loop executes a few times.

The loop code is:
```python
for _ in range(2, n + 1):
    a, b = b, a + b
```
From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can see that:
- After 1 iteration, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3, which suggests that `a` and `b` are updated based on their previous values.
- After 2 iterations, `a` is 3 and `b` is 4.
- After 3 iterations, `a` is 4 and `b` is 7.

The pattern in `a` and `b` seems to follow the Fibonacci sequence, where each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.

Given the initial state where `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 1, `a` is 2, and `b` is 1, we can analyze the loop's behavior:

- The loop starts from 2 and goes up to `n` (inclusive).
- In each iteration, `a` and `b` are updated to `b` and `a + b`, respectively.

If `n` is 2, the loop will execute once, and `a` will become 1 and `b` will become 3, as seen in the output state after 1 iteration.

If `n` is greater than 2, the loop will continue to update `a` and `b` based on the Fibonacci sequence.

So, after all iterations of the loop have finished, `a` and `b` will hold the `(n-1)`th and `n`th Fibonacci numbers, respectively, with the initial values of `a` being 2 (which corresponds to the 3rd Fibonacci number) and `b` being 1 (which corresponds to the 2nd Fibonacci number).

However, considering the standard Fibonacci sequence starts with 0 and 1, and given `a` starts as 2 and `b` as 1, we adjust our understanding to fit the sequence generated by the loop.

The loop effectively generates a sequence where `a` and `b` are consecutive numbers in a sequence that starts with the initial values of `a` and `b`, and for each iteration, the next number in the sequence is the sum of the previous two.

Given this, we can conclude that after all iterations, `a` will be the `(n-1)`th number in this sequence (if we consider the initial `a` and `b` as the first two numbers), and `b` will be the `n`th number in the sequence.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 1, `a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1, `b` is the nth Fibonacci-like number in a sequence starting with 2 and 1.**
