To ensure the loop can execute at least one time, we need to examine the condition of the `while` loop, which is `n > 0`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, meaning it has to be a positive integer.

State: **`n` must be a positive integer, `total` is 0**
