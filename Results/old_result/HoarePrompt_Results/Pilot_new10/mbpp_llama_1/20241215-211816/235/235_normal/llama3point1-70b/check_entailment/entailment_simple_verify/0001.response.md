The original assessment is "None", which means there is no prior judgment about the program's correctness. Based on the problem description, the program is supposed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.

The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes an integer `n`, converts it to a string, and then uses a generator expression to iterate over each character (digit) in the string. It converts each character back to an integer and sums them up using the built-in `sum` function.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the state of the program right before the function call is that `n` is a non-negative integer, and the function returns the sum of the digits of `n`.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.

The reason the original assessment was "None" is that there was no prior evaluation of the program. However, after analyzing the code and the annotated version, it is evident that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
