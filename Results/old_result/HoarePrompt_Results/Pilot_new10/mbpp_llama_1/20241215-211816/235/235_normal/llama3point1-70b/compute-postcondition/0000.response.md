To calculate the output state, let's break down the given code. The code converts the integer `n` into a string, then iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts it back into an integer, and sums up all these digits.

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, the possible values of `n` range from 0 to infinity.

The code `return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))` essentially calculates the sum of the digits of `n`. For example, if `n` is 123, the code will return `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.

Since `n` can be any non-negative integer, the sum of its digits can also vary widely. However, we can describe the nature of the return value: it will be a non-negative integer because the sum of digits of any non-negative integer is always non-negative.

Output State: **The program returns the sum of the digits of `n`, which is a non-negative integer.**
