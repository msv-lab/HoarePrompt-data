The code `n //= 10` removes the last digit of `n`. Given that `n` is the original `n` without the last digit and is greater than 0, after executing the code, `n` will be the original `n` without the last two digits.

The value of `total` is equal to 2 times the last digit of the original `n` plus the last digit of `n` (which is the second-to-last digit of the original `n`). This value does not change as the code only updates the value of `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the original `n` without the last two digits and is greater than 0, `total` is equal to 2 times the last digit of the original `n` plus the last digit of `n` (which is the second-to-last digit of the original `n`).
Output State: **`n` is the original `n` without the last two digits and is greater than 0, `total` is equal to 2 times the last digit of the original `n` plus the last digit of the original `n` without the last digit**
