To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

The loop condition is `while n > 0:`. This means for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 0 after the previous iteration.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration: 
- `n` is the integer part of `n` divided by 10.
- `total` is the last digit of the original `n` (an integer between 0 and 9).

From the given state, `n` being the integer part of `n` divided by 10 implies that `n` has been reduced to a smaller value, specifically by removing the last digit (since dividing by 10 shifts all digits one place to the right). For `n` to be greater than 0 after this operation, the original `n` (before the division) must have had at least two digits, because if `n` was a single digit, dividing it by 10 would result in 0 (since the integer part of any single digit number divided by 10 is 0).

`total` being the last digit of the original `n` does not directly affect the loop condition but indicates what happened to the original `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` (which is now the integer part of the original `n` divided by 10) must be greater than 0. This implies that the original `n` must have been at least 10 or more, so when divided by 10 and taking the integer part, `n` is still greater than 0.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `n` must be greater than 0, and since `total` is a result of the previous iteration and does not affect the loop condition directly, it remains as is.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `total` is the last digit of the original `n` (an integer between 0 and 9)**
