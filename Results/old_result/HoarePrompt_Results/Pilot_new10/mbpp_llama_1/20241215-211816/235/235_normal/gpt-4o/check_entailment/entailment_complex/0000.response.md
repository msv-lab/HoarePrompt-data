To verify the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it step by step in relation to the problem description.

The problem description asks for a function that calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function `func_1(n)` is provided for this purpose.

Here's the breakdown of how `func_1(n)` works:
1. It initializes a variable `total` to 0. This variable will be used to accumulate the sum of the digits of `n`.
2. It enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
3. Inside the loop, it calculates `n % 10`, which gives the remainder when `n` is divided by 10, effectively extracting the last digit of `n`. This digit is then added to `total`.
4. The line `n //= 10` then removes the last digit from `n` by performing integer division by 10.
5. Steps 3 and 4 repeat until `n` becomes 0, at which point all digits have been processed and their sum accumulated in `total`.
6. Finally, the function returns `total`, which is the sum of all the digits of the original `n`.

Considering the problem description and the provided annotations, here are a few key points to verify the correctness of `func_1(n)`:
- The function correctly handles non-negative integers by using a while loop that continues until `n` is 0, ensuring all digits are processed.
- It correctly calculates the sum of the digits by using the modulo operator (`%`) to extract each digit and adding it to `total`.
- The function returns 0 when `n` is 0, which is the expected behavior since the sum of no digits (or the digits of 0) is 0.

Given these points, the program as described meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly calculates the sum of the digits of any non-negative integer `n`, including the case where `n` is 0.

Therefore, the program is correct as it aligns with the problem description for all possible non-negative integer inputs.

Correctness: **True**
