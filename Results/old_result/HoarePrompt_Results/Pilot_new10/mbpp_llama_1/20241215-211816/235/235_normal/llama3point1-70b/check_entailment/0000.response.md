Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` is designed to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. It achieves this by first converting the integer into a string, then iterating over each character (digit) in the string, converting it back into an integer, and summing these up.

Here's why this function works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Non-negativity**: The function does not explicitly check for non-negativity, but in Python, attempting to convert a negative number to a string and then iterating over its digits would still technically work, though it would include the negative sign as a character, not a digit. However, the problem description and common mathematical interpretation assume non-negative integers for such operations, meaning inputs should not include the negative sign. For any non-negative integer, the function should work as expected.

2. **Conversion to String**: Converting an integer to a string allows for easy iteration over each digit, which is then converted back to an integer for summation. This approach correctly handles integers of any length.

3. **Summation**: The `sum` function with a generator expression is an efficient way to add up all the digits.

Potential edge cases to consider:

- **Zero**: The function should handle the input `0` correctly. Since `str(0)` is `'0'`, and `int('0')` is `0`, the sum is correctly `0`.

- **Single-digit numbers**: For any single-digit number `n`, `str(n)` will be a string of length 1, and `int(str(n))` returns `n` itself. Thus, the function works for single-digit inputs.

- **Multi-digit numbers**: The function also correctly handles multi-digit numbers by iterating over each character in the string representation of the number and summing them up.

- **Large numbers**: Python can handle arbitrarily large integers, so the function should work for large inputs as well, limited only by available memory.

Given the provided code and the problem description, it seems the function correctly calculates the sum of the digits of any non-negative integer. Thus, without being able to find a case where the function does not work as expected, it is reasonable to conclude that the function is correct.
