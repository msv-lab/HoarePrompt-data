Correctness: **False**

Explanation: Although the provided code seems to correctly calculate the sum of digits for non-negative integers, it does not handle cases where the input is not a non-negative integer. The output hints agree with this assessment by stating that the function does not include error checking for negative integers, non-integers, or non-numeric inputs. If the input is a negative integer, a non-integer, or a non-numeric value, the function may either produce incorrect results or throw an error. 

For example, if the input is a negative integer like -123, the function will still calculate the sum of its digits (1+2+3 = 6) without considering the sign. However, the problem description specifies that the function should work for non-negative integers. 

Another case where the function does not work correctly is when the input is a non-numeric string. For instance, if the input is "hello", the function will throw an error because it cannot convert the string "hello" into an integer.

To make the function correct, it should include error checking to ensure that the input is a non-negative integer. If the input is not valid, the function should either return an error message or handle the input according to the problem's requirements. 

Here's an example of how you could modify the function to add error checking:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n < 0:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a non-negative integer")
    return sum((int(digit) for digit in str(n)))
```
