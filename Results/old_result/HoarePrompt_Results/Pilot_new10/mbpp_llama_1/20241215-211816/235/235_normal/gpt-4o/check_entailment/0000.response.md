Correctness: **True**.

I believe the code is correct because it handles the problem description accurately. The code calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer by using a while loop to continuously add the remainder of the number when divided by 10 (i.e., the last digit) to the total sum and then removing the last digit by performing integer division by 10. This process continues until the number becomes 0. 

Here are some example cases that demonstrate the correctness of the code:
- `func_1(345)` returns 12, which is the sum of the digits 3, 4, and 5.
- `func_1(12)` returns 3, which is the sum of the digits 1 and 2.
- `func_1(97)` returns 16, which is the sum of the digits 9 and 7.
- `func_1(0)` returns 0, which is the sum of the digits of 0 (i.e., there are no digits to sum).
- `func_1(1000)` returns 1, which is the sum of the digits of 1000.

I couldn't find a single case where the program does not work correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct and should return the expected results for all non-negative integers.
