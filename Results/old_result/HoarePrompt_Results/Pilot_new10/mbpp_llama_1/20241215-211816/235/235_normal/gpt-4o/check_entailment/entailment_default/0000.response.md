Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple and efficient implementation of a function to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:
- The function initializes a variable `total` to 0, which will store the sum of the digits.
- It then enters a while loop that continues as long as `n` is greater than 0.
- Inside the loop, it calculates the last digit of `n` using the modulus operator (`n % 10`), adds it to `total`, and then removes the last digit from `n` using integer division (`n //= 10`).
- This process repeats until all digits have been processed (i.e., `n` becomes 0).
- Finally, the function returns the total sum of the digits.

The output hints agree with this explanation, and the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for several examples. Additionally, the function handles the edge case where `n` is 0 correctly, returning 0 as expected.

The function's logic is sound and correctly implements the problem description for all non-negative integers. It correctly calculates the sum of the digits for every potential case, including single-digit numbers, multi-digit numbers, and the special case of 0. Therefore, the code is correct and should work as expected for all valid inputs.
