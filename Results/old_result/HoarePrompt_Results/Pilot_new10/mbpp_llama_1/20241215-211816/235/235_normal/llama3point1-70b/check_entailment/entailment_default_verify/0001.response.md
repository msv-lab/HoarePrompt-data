The original assessment is none, so there's no explicit claim of correctness or incorrectness to evaluate. However, based on the problem description and the provided code, we can assess the correctness of the program directly.

The problem description asks for a function to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes an input `n`, converts it into a string, iterates over each character (digit) in the string, converts the character back into an integer, and sums these digits up.

Given the constraint that we assume the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-negative integer), the code does indeed calculate the sum of the digits correctly. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each digit of the input number `n`, converting it to a string to easily iterate over the digits, and then converting each character back to an integer before summing.

The output hints mention that the function does not include error checking for negative integers, non-integers, or non-numeric inputs. However, since we are working under the assumption that the input will always be a valid non-negative integer, the lack of error checking for invalid inputs does not affect the correctness of the function within the specified constraints.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code provided, and the assumption of valid inputs, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
