The code `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `n`. 

Since `n` is greater than 0 and `total` is equal to 2 times the last digit of `n`, let's denote the last digit of the original `n` as `d`. Then, `total = 2 * d`. 

After the division, `n` will be the original `n` without the last digit, which means it will be `n` divided by 10 (integer division), or more specifically, `n` without the last digit `d`, so `n` becomes `n // 10` or `n` without `d`. 

The value of `total` remains unchanged as it was initially set to 2 times the last digit of the original `n`, not the updated `n`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0 and is now the original `n` without the last digit, `total` is equal to 2 times the last digit of the original `n`.
Output State: **`n` is the original `n` without the last digit, `total` is equal to 2 times the last digit of the original `n`.**
