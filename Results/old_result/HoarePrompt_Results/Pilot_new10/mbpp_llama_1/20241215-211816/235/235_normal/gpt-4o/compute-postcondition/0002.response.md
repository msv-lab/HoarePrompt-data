The code `total += n % 10` updates the value of `total` by adding the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Since `n` is a positive integer, `n % 10` will be the last digit of `n`, which is an integer between 0 and 9. 

The initial value of `total` is 0. After the code is executed, `total` will be equal to the last digit of `n`. The value of `n` is still a positive integer.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `total` is equal to the last digit of `n` (an integer between 0 and 9)**
