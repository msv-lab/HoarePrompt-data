Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` is designed to extract the first element of each sublist in the input list `lst`. The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's ability to handle sublists of varying lengths, and the function itself does not contain any logic that could potentially lead to incorrect results.

The output hints provide additional information about the function's behavior, but they do not contradict the original assessment. The hints state that the function returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist, which aligns with the function's implementation.

One potential point of discrepancy between the original assessment and the output hints is the behavior of the function when `lst` contains empty sublists. The output hints suggest that the function throws an error in this case, but the provided code does not include any error checking or handling for empty sublists. However, since the problem statement assumes that the input will be valid, we can assume that the input will not contain empty sublists, and therefore this discrepancy does not affect the overall correctness of the function.

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the function is correct based on the problem description and the provided code.

Final: **True**
