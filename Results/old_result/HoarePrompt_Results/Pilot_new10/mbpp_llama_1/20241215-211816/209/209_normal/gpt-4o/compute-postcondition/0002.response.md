The function `func_1` accepts a list of lists `lst` as its parameter. According to the code, it uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing the first element of each sublist in `lst`. 

However, potential edge cases to consider include:
- If `lst` is not a list of lists, but a list containing non-list elements, the function will throw an error when it tries to access the first element of a non-list item.
- If any sublist in `lst` is empty, the function will throw an error when it tries to access the first element of an empty list.
- If `lst` itself is empty, the function will return an empty list.

Considering these edge cases, the functionality of `func_1` is to return a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist in `lst`, assuming `lst` is a list of lists. If `lst` contains non-list items or empty sublists, the function may throw an error. If `lst` is empty, it returns an empty list.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists `lst` and returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist in `lst`, or throws an error if `lst` contains non-list items or empty sublists, and returns an empty list if `lst` is empty **
