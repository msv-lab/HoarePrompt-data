The original assessment states that the provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. After reviewing the problem description, the original code, and the annotated code, I agree with the original assessment.

The problem description asks for a function to get the first element of each sublist, and the provided function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to achieve this. The function iterates over each sublist in the input list `lst` and extracts the first element of each sublist using `sublist[0]`.

The annotated version of the code also supports the original assessment. The annotation states that the program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in `lst`, which aligns with the expected behavior.

Since we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors, the function's lack of error handling for edge cases such as an empty list or a list containing only one sublist does not affect its correctness.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
