Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where a sublist is empty. If a sublist is empty, the expression `sublist[0]` will raise an `IndexError` because there is no first element to access. 

For example, if the input to the function is `[[1, 2, 3], [], [4, 5, 6]]`, the function will raise an `IndexError` when it tries to access the first element of the empty sublist `[]`.

To fix this issue, the function could add a check to handle empty sublists, for example:

```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] if sublist else None for sublist in sublists]
```

This modified function will return `None` for empty sublists instead of raising an error.
