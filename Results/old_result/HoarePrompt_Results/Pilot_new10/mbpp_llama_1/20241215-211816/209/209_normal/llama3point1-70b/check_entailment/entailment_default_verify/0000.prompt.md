You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
Program:
```
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to extract the first element of each sublist. This approach is correct and will work for all potential cases. Here's why:

* The function takes a list of sublists `sublists` as input.
* The list comprehension `[sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]` iterates over each sublist and extracts the first element using `sublist[0]`.
* The resulting list of first elements is then returned by the function.

This implementation is correct for several reasons:

* It handles empty sublists by raising an `IndexError`, which is the expected behavior when trying to access an element at index 0 of an empty list.
* It handles nested sublists of varying lengths correctly, as it only extracts the first element of each sublist.
* It handles the case where the input list is empty, returning an empty list as expected.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct. 

However, it is worth noting that the function does not include any error checking to handle cases where the input is not a list of lists, or where the sublists are not lists. If such error checking is desired, the function could be modified to include checks and handle these cases accordingly. But based on the problem description provided, the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists and returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist; it returns an empty list if the input list is empty, and raises an exception if the input list contains empty sublists or non-list elements.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
