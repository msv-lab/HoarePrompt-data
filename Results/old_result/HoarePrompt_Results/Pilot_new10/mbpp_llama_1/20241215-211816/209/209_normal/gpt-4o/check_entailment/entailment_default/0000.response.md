Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description and the output hints. The code uses a list comprehension to extract the first element of each sublist in the input list `lst`. However, the output hints state that the function should throw an error if `lst` contains non-list items or empty sublists.

The provided code does not handle these cases. For example, if the input list contains an empty sublist, the code will not throw an error, but instead, it will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access the first element of the empty sublist.

Additionally, if the input list contains non-list items, the code will raise a `TypeError` when trying to access the first element of a non-list item.

To meet the requirements specified in the problem description and the output hints, the code should be modified to handle these edge cases. Here is an example of how the code could be modified:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not all(isinstance(sublist, list) for sublist in lst):
        raise ValueError("Input list contains non-list items")
    if any(len(sublist) == 0 for sublist in lst):
        raise ValueError("Input list contains empty sublists")
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
```

This modified code checks if all elements in the input list are lists and if any of the sublists are empty. If either condition is met, it raises a `ValueError` with a corresponding error message. Otherwise, it returns the first element of each non-empty sublist.
