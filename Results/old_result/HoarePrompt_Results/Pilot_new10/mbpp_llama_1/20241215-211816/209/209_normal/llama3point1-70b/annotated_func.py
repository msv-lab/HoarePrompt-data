#State of the program right berfore the function call: sublists is a list of lists.
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
    #The program returns a list containing the first element of each sublist in 'sublists'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists and returns a list containing the first element of each non-empty sublist; it returns an empty list if the input list is empty, and raises an exception if the input list contains empty sublists or non-list elements.
