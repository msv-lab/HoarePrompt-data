Correctness: **False**

The code does not meet the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires the function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the code calculates the sum of all unique integers in the list. These two requirements are different. The code uses a set to remove duplicate elements, but it does not consider the count of each element in the original list. It simply sums up all unique elements.

For example, if the input list is [1, 2, 2, 3], the function should return 1 + 3 = 4, because 2 is a repeated element and should not be included in the sum. However, the code will return 1 + 2 + 3 = 6, which is incorrect.

The output hints also mention that the function will throw an error if the list contains non-integer values, which is another case where the code does not meet the problem description. The problem description does not specify what to do with non-integer values, so the code should either handle them or explicitly state that it does not support them.

Therefore, the code is not correct for every potential case, and the correctness is False.
