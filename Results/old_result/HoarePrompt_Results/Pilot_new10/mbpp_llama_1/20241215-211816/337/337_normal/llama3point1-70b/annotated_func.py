#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1)
    #The program returns the sum of all integers in the list 'lst' that appear only once.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, returns the sum of all integers that appear only once in the list, and handles cases where the list is empty or contains duplicate or unique integers, but may raise errors if the input list contains non-integer values or is not a list.
