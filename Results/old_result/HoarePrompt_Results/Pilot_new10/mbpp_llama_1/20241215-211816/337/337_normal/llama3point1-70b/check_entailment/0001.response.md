Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over the list and includes an element in the sum only if its count in the list is 1, which is determined by `lst.count(i) == 1`. This logic is directly aligned with the problem description.

For any potential case, including lists with duplicate elements, single-element lists, empty lists, or lists with all unique elements, the function works as expected:

1. **Empty List**: An empty list will return 0, which is the correct sum of non-repeated elements (since there are no elements).
2. **List with All Unique Elements**: The function will sum all elements, which is correct because all elements in such a list are non-repeated.
3. **List with Duplicate Elements**: Only elements that appear once are counted towards the sum, which matches the problem's requirement.
4. **Single-Element List**: Since the single element appears only once, it is correctly included in the sum.

Given the logic and examples, the code appears to handle all potential cases as specified by the problem description. Without finding a specific case where the code does not work as expected, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
