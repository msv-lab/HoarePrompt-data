To determine the correctness of the program, let's analyze the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description requires writing a Python function to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The provided program uses the `sum` function and `set` data structure to calculate the sum of unique integers in the list.

The original assessment is "None", which implies that no initial judgment was made about the program's correctness.

The annotated version of the code explains the state of the program at different points. It clarifies that the function accepts a list of integers, calculates the sum of all unique integers in the list, and returns this sum.

Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function seems to be correct. It correctly calculates the sum of unique integers in the list by using the `set` data structure to remove duplicates and the `sum` function to calculate the sum.

However, it's essential to note that the function does not explicitly handle cases where the list contains non-integer values or is empty. Nevertheless, as per the problem statement, we assume the input will always be valid.

The annotated version of the code supports the idea that the function works as expected. It correctly describes the state of the program before and after the function call.

Given this analysis, the original assessment of "None" does not provide any information about the program's correctness. However, based on the problem description, the code, and the annotated version, it seems that the program is correct.

The reason for this assessment is that the function correctly implements the required functionality, and the assumptions about the input being valid are clearly stated.

Final: **True**
