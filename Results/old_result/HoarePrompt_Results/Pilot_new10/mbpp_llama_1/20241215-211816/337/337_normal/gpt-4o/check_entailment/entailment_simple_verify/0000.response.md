The original assessment is None, which means there was no initial judgment made about the program's correctness. 

Given the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` is supposed to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The function uses the `set` function to remove duplicate elements from the list and then sums up the remaining unique elements.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function returns the sum of all unique integers in the list `lst`. However, the problem description asks for the sum of non-repeated elements, which implies that elements that appear more than once in the list should be excluded from the sum entirely, not just counted once.

The provided unit tests also suggest that the function should return the sum of all unique elements, not just the non-repeated ones. For example, in the test case `assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]) == 21`, the function correctly returns the sum of all unique elements (1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 = 21), even though the element 1 is repeated.

Based on the provided code and the unit tests, it seems that the function is actually implementing a different problem, which is to find the sum of all unique elements in the list.

Therefore, considering the problem description and the annotated code, the original assessment (None) is not accurate because the program does not match the problem description.

Final: **False**
