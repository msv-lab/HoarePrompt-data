To analyze the provided function `func_1`, we first need to understand what the code does, line by line, considering the annotations for context but prioritizing the actual code behavior.

1. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is described as a list of integers in the annotations.

2. The function uses the `sum` function in combination with the `set` function on the input list `lst`. The `set` function removes duplicate elements from the list because sets in Python cannot contain duplicate values. Therefore, `sum(set(lst))` calculates the sum of all unique integers in the list.

3. The return postcondition states that the program returns the sum of all unique integers in the list `lst`, which aligns with the code's behavior.

Given this analysis, the functionality of `func_1` can be summarized as follows:

- It accepts a list of integers as input.
- It calculates the sum of all unique integers in the list by removing duplicates through the use of a set.
- It returns this sum.

However, we must also consider potential edge cases and missing logic:

- **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, the function will return 0 because the sum of an empty set is 0.
- **Non-Integer Values**: If the list contains non-integer values, the function will throw an error when it tries to sum these values because the `sum` function requires all elements to be numeric. The annotations and return postconditions do not mention handling non-integer values, so this is an important consideration.
- **Negative Numbers and Zero**: The function handles negative numbers and zero correctly, as these are valid integers and are summed accordingly.

Therefore, considering all potential cases and the actual code behavior, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers, calculates the sum of all unique integers in the list, and returns this sum. If the list is empty, it returns 0. However, if the list contains non-integer values, it will throw an error, as it does not handle such cases. **
