The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` as input and returns the sum of all integers in the list that appear only once.

Looking at the code, it uses a generator expression to iterate over each integer `i` in the list `lst`. For each integer, it checks if the count of `i` in `lst` is equal to 1 using the `count` method. If the count is 1, it includes `i` in the sum. The `sum` function then adds up all the integers that meet this condition.

The code handles cases where:

* The input list is empty: In this case, the `sum` function will return 0 because there are no integers to sum.
* The input list contains only unique integers: In this case, the `sum` function will return the sum of all integers in the list.
* The input list contains duplicate integers: In this case, the `sum` function will only include each integer in the sum if it appears only once in the list.
* The input list contains non-integer values: Although the annotations state that the list contains integers, the code does not explicitly check for this. However, if the list contains non-integer values, the `count` method will still work correctly, and the `sum` function will attempt to add up the non-integer values. This could potentially raise a TypeError if the non-integer values cannot be added to integers.

The code does not handle cases where the input is not a list or is None. In these cases, the code will raise an AttributeError or TypeError.

Overall, the functionality of the function is to calculate the sum of all unique integers in the input list.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers, returns the sum of all integers that appear only once in the list, and handles cases where the list is empty or contains duplicate or unique integers, but may raise errors if the input list contains non-integer values or is not a list. **
