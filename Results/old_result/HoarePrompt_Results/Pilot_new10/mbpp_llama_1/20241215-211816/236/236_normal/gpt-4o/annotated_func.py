#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that can be compared, such as integers, floats, or strings.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements that can be compared, which is either sorted in ascending order or has fewer than two elements, and `i` is `len(lst) - 2` if the loop completes normally, indicating no adjacent elements in `lst` have the first greater than the second.
    return True
    #The program returns boolean value True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of comparable elements and returns True if the list is sorted in ascending order or has fewer than two elements, and False otherwise. It does not handle lists with non-comparable elements, which may result in a TypeError.
