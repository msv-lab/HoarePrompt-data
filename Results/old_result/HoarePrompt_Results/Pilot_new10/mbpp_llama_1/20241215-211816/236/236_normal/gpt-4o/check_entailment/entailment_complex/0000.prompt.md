You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that can be compared, such as integers, floats, or strings.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements that can be compared, which is either sorted in ascending order or has fewer than two elements, and `i` is `len(lst) - 2` if the loop completes normally, indicating no adjacent elements in `lst` have the first greater than the second.
    return True
    #The program returns boolean value True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of comparable elements and returns True if the list is sorted in ascending order or has fewer than two elements, and False otherwise. It does not handle lists with non-comparable elements, which may result in a TypeError.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
