According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `lst`. If `i` is less than `len(lst) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `lst` has at least 3 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. The loop condition `i < len(lst) - 1` must still be met, which means `len(lst)` must be at least 3 (so `len(lst) - 1` is at least 2) for `i` to be 2. Since the condition that the element at index `i` is less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1` still holds, no changes are made to the relative ordering of elements in `lst`. Therefore, `lst` is still a list with at least 3 elements.

State: **`lst` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**
