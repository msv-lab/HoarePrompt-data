To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's break down the information given and analyze it step by step.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. This implies the function should return `True` if the list is sorted (either in ascending or descending order) and `False` otherwise.

2. **Original Program**:
    ```python
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    ```
    This function works by comparing the input list `nums` with its sorted version. If they are equal, it means the original list was already sorted in ascending order, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

3. **Original Assessment**: None. There is no initial judgment provided about the correctness of the program.

4. **Annotated Version of the Program**:
    ```python
# State of the program right before the function call: nums is a list of comparable elements (e.g., integers, floats, strings).
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    # The program returns True if the list 'nums' is sorted in ascending order, False otherwise.
# Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts a list of comparable elements, returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, `False` otherwise, and may raise an exception if the list contains non-comparable elements or if sorting the list fails for any reason.
    ```
    The annotations clarify that the function is designed to work with lists of comparable elements and checks for sorting in ascending order.

Given this information, the original assessment's absence means there's no baseline judgment to correct or confirm. However, by analyzing the program and its annotated version, we can determine the program's correctness based on the problem description.

- The program checks if the input list is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version, which is a valid approach for determining if a list is sorted in ascending order.
- The annotations make it clear that the function is intended to work with comparable elements and that it checks for ascending order sorting, which aligns with common sorting expectations.

However, it's worth noting that the problem description does not explicitly state the sorting order (ascending or descending), but the provided program and its annotations assume ascending order. This assumption might not fully align with the open-ended nature of the problem description, which could implicitly include descending order as well.

Despite this potential ambiguity, the program as given and annotated does correctly implement a solution for checking if a list is sorted in ascending order, which is a common and reasonable interpretation of the problem.

**Final: True**
