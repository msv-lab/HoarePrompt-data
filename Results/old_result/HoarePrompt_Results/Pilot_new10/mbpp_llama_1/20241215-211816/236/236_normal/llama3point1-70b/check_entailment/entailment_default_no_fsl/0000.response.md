Correctness: **True**

The provided program is a Python function `func_1` that checks whether a specified list `nums` is sorted in ascending order. It achieves this by comparing the original list with a sorted version of itself using the built-in `sorted` function. If the two lists are equal, it means the original list was already sorted, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach works for every potential case because it relies on the standard behavior of the `sorted` function, which can handle lists of comparable elements such as numbers or strings. The function will correctly identify sorted lists, regardless of their length or the type of elements they contain, as long as those elements are comparable.

For lists that contain non-comparable elements (e.g., mixing numbers and strings that cannot be compared directly), or if sorting the list fails for any reason, the `sorted` function will raise a `TypeError`. This behavior aligns with the output hints provided, which mention the possibility of exceptions for such cases.

Since the program effectively checks if a list is sorted in ascending order for all comparable elements, handles non-comparable elements by potentially raising an exception (as indicated by the hints), and does not contain any logical errors for the cases described, it can be considered correct according to the problem description.
