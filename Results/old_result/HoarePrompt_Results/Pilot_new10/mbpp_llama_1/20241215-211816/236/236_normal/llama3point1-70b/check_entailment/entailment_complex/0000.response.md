Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether a specified list `nums` is sorted or not. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function takes a list of comparable elements as input, which aligns with the problem description.
2. It uses the built-in `sorted` function in Python, which sorts the list in ascending order by default.
3. The function returns `True` if the input list `nums` is equal to the sorted list, and `False` otherwise.
4. If the list contains non-comparable elements or if sorting the list fails for any reason, Python will raise an exception, which is also mentioned in the program's overall description.

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the function will return `True` because the list is already sorted in ascending order. If the input list is `[5, 2, 8, 1, 3]`, the function will return `False` because the list is not sorted.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including lists that are already sorted, lists that are not sorted, and lists that contain non-comparable elements. Therefore, it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description and is considered correct.
