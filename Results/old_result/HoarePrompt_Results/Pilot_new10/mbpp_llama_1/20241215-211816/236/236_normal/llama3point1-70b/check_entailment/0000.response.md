Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it checks if the specified list is sorted or not by comparing it with its sorted version. The `sorted()` function in Python returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. If the original list is already sorted, then it will be equal to its sorted version, and the function will return `True`. Otherwise, it will return `False`.

This approach works correctly for all possible cases, including:

- Empty lists: An empty list is considered sorted, and the function will return `True`.
- Single-element lists: A single-element list is considered sorted, and the function will return `True`.
- Lists with duplicate elements: The function will correctly handle lists with duplicate elements.
- Lists with negative numbers or zero: The function will correctly handle lists with negative numbers or zero.
- Lists that are not sorted: The function will correctly return `False` for lists that are not sorted.

Overall, the program is simple and effective, and it works correctly for all possible cases.
