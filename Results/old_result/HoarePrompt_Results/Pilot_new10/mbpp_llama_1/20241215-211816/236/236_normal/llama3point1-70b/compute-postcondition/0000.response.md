To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

The initial state is that `nums` is a list of comparable elements. This means `nums` can contain integers, floats, or strings, as these are comparable in Python.

The code snippet is `return nums == sorted(nums)`. This line of code checks if the list `nums` is already sorted in ascending order by comparing it to its sorted version.

- If `nums` is already sorted, then `nums` equals `sorted(nums)`, and the expression will evaluate to `True`.
- If `nums` is not sorted, then `nums` does not equal `sorted(nums)`, and the expression will evaluate to `False`.

Given that `nums` can be any list of comparable elements (but we don't have a specific list to evaluate), the potential return values are boolean: `True` if the list is sorted and `False` if it is not.

Output State: **The program returns True if the list 'nums' is sorted in ascending order, False otherwise.**
