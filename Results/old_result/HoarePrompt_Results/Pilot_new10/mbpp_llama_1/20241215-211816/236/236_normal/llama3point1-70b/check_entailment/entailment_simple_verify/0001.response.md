The original assessment is "None", meaning there is no prior assessment to evaluate. 

The problem description requires a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `nums` as input and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function works as intended. The annotation states that the program returns `True` if the list 'nums' is sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise, which aligns with the problem description.

Based on the problem description and the annotated code, it appears that the program is correct. The function `func_1` accurately checks if the input list `nums` is sorted in ascending order by comparing it with its sorted version.

Final: **True**
