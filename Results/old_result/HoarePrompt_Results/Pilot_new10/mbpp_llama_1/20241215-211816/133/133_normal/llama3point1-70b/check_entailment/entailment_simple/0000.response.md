Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes in two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` as input.
2. The `zip(tup1, tup2)` function is used to iterate over the elements of both tuples in parallel, based on their index. This ensures that corresponding elements from both tuples are paired together.
3. The generator expression `(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))` subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the elements of the first tuple, based on their index.
4. The `tuple()` function is used to convert the generator expression into a tuple, which is then returned by the function.

This program will work correctly for all potential cases, assuming that the input tuples are of the same length and contain only numbers (either integers or floats). 

For example, if `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5, 6)`, the function will return `(-3, -3, -3)`, which is the result of subtracting corresponding elements from both tuples.

The program does not contain any checks to ensure that the input tuples are of the same length or contain only numbers. However, since the problem description assumes that these conditions are met, the program is correct within the context of the problem description. 

If the input tuples are not of the same length, the `zip()` function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, potentially leading to incorrect results. Similarly, if the tuples contain non-numeric elements, the subtraction operation will raise a `TypeError`. However, these cases are outside the scope of the problem description.
