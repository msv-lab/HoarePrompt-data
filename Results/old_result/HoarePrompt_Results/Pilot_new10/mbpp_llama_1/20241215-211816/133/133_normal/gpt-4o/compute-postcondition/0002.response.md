The function func_1 accepts two parameters, tup1 and tup2, which are expected to be tuples of the same length containing elements that support subtraction, such as numbers. 

Looking at the code line by line, the function uses the zip function to iterate over the corresponding elements of tup1 and tup2 in parallel, and then uses a generator expression to calculate the difference between each pair of elements. 

The code does not explicitly check if tup1 and tup2 are of the same length or if they contain only numeric elements, it simply attempts to subtract the elements. 

If tup1 and tup2 are not of the same length, the zip function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple. 

If the tuples contain non-numeric elements, a TypeError will be raised when trying to subtract them.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to calculate the differences between corresponding elements of two tuples, tup1 and tup2, and return these differences as a tuple. It assumes that both tuples are of the same length and contain elements that support subtraction, but does not explicitly enforce these conditions.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two tuples, tup1 and tup2, and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of tup1 and tup2. It stops once the end of the shorter tuple is reached if they are not of the same length, and raises a TypeError if the tuples contain non-numeric elements. **
