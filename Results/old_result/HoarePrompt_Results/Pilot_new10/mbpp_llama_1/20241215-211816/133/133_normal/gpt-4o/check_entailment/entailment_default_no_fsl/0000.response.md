Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` and returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. The function uses the built-in `zip` function to iterate over the elements of the two tuples in parallel, and a generator expression to compute the differences.

The function will stop once the end of the shorter tuple is reached if they are not of the same length, which is the expected behavior according to the output hints. Additionally, the function will raise a `TypeError` if the tuples contain non-numeric elements, because the `-` operator is not defined for non-numeric types.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correct behavior of the function for different inputs. The function correctly handles cases where the tuples are of the same length and contain numeric elements.

It's worth noting that the function does not explicitly check if the input tuples are of the same length or if they contain non-numeric elements. However, the built-in `zip` function and the `-` operator will raise exceptions or produce the correct results in these cases, so the function does not need to include explicit checks. 

Therefore, based on the provided code and output hints, the function is correct and behaves as expected according to the problem description.
