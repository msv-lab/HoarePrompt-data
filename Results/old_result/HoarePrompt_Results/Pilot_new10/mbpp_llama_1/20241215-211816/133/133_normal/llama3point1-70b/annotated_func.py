#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of the same length, containing numbers (either integers or floats).
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the differences between corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`, where each difference is a number (either an integer or a float).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples of numbers, calculates the differences between corresponding elements, and returns these differences as a tuple, assuming the tuples are of the same length and contain numeric elements, with potential edge cases including length mismatches, non-numeric elements, and empty tuples.
