Correctness: **False**.

The code provided seems to be correct in terms of syntax and functionality. It takes two tuples as input, subtracts the elements of the second tuple from the corresponding elements of the first tuple, and returns the result as a tuple. However, the code does not handle potential edge cases such as length mismatches, non-numeric elements, and empty tuples.

For example, if the two input tuples have different lengths, the `zip` function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, and the remaining elements in the longer tuple will be ignored. This may not be the expected behavior, as the problem description does not specify what to do in this case.

Another edge case is when the tuples contain non-numeric elements. The `-` operator will raise a `TypeError` when trying to subtract a non-numeric value from a numeric value.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where one or both of the input tuples are empty. In this case, the function will return an empty tuple, which may or may not be the expected behavior.

To correctly handle these edge cases, the function could add error checking code to ensure that the tuples have the same length and contain only numeric elements, and handle the case where one or both of the tuples are empty.

Here are some examples of how the function could fail:

* `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5))` will return `(1 - 4, 2 - 5)` and ignore the third element of the first tuple, which may not be the expected behavior.
* `func_1((1, 'a', 3), (4, 5, 6))` will raise a `TypeError` when trying to subtract `'a'` from `5`.
* `func_1((), ())` will return an empty tuple, which may or may not be the expected behavior.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**.
