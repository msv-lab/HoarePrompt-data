Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. 

The issue arises when the input tuples are not of the same length. The `zip` function in Python stops at the end of the shortest input iterable, meaning it will ignore any extra elements in the longer tuple. This does not align with the problem description, which does not specify what should happen in the case of tuples of different lengths.

For example, if `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5)`, the function will return `(1 - 4, 2 - 5) = (-3, -3)`, ignoring the third element of `tup1`. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle this case, and it would be more accurate to raise an error or handle it in a way that is explicitly defined.

Additionally, the function also does not handle cases where the tuples contain non-numeric elements. For instance, if `tup1 = (1, 2, '3')` and `tup2 = (4, 5, 6)`, the function will raise a TypeError when trying to subtract `'3'` and `6`.

To be correct, the function should either handle these edge cases explicitly or raise an error when they occur.
