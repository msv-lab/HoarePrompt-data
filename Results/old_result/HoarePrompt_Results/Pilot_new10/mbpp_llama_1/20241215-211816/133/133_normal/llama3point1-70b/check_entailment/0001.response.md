Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct because it correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes in two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple where each element at index `i` is the result of subtracting the element at index `i` in `tup2` from the element at index `i` in `tup1`. 

The use of the `zip` function ensures that the elements from both tuples are iterated over in parallel, and the generator expression `(a - b for (a, b) in zip(tup1, tup2))` correctly subtracts the corresponding elements. The result is then converted back to a tuple using the `tuple` function.

There are no edge cases that the program does not handle correctly. It works for tuples of any length, as long as they are of the same length, because `zip` will stop at the end of the shorter tuple. However, since the problem statement does not specify what should happen if the tuples are of different lengths, it could be argued that the function should either check for this and raise an error or handle it in a specific way. But based strictly on the description given, assuming both tuples are of the same length, the program behaves as expected.

For example, if you call `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6))`, the function will correctly return `(-3, -3, -3)`, which are the results of the subtractions `1-4`, `2-5`, and `3-6`. 

If the tuples were of different lengths, like `func_1((1, 2, 3), (4, 5))`, the function will return `(-3, -3)`, which might or might not be the desired behavior depending on additional constraints not specified in the problem statement. However, since the problem statement does not explicitly address this scenario, and the provided code does not fail or produce incorrect results under the assumptions that can be inferred from the description, the code is considered correct under the given constraints.
