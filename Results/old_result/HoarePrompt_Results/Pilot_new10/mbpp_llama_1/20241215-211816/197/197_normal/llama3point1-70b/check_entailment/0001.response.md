Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(tup, lst)` counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each element in the list and sums up the counts of each element in the tuple.

Here's why this code is correct:

- It correctly handles cases where the list contains elements that are present in the tuple, as it counts their occurrences accurately.

- If the list contains elements that are not present in the tuple, `tup.count(element)` will return 0 for those elements, which is the correct count.

- The function also handles duplicate elements in the list correctly, as it counts the occurrences of each element in the tuple for every occurrence of that element in the list.

- It handles edge cases, such as an empty list or an empty tuple, correctly, returning 0 in both cases.

For example, if `tup = (1, 2, 2, 3)` and `lst = [2, 3, 4]`, the function will correctly return 3, which is the sum of the counts of 2 (2) and 3 (1) in the tuple, and 0 for 4 since it is not in the tuple.

Overall, the code provided accurately counts the occurrences of all elements of a list in a tuple and handles all potential cases as expected.
