Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of all elements in the list within the tuple. It handles various cases such as duplicate elements in the list, empty inputs, and different types of inputs. 

Here are some reasons why the code is correct:

1. **Handling duplicate elements in the list**: The function uses a generator expression to count the occurrences of each element in the list. If an element is duplicated in the list, the `tup.count(element)` call will be executed multiple times for that element, effectively counting its occurrences in the tuple for each occurrence in the list.

2. **Handling empty inputs**: If the list or the tuple is empty, the function will simply return 0, as the `sum` function will sum up the counts of the elements in the empty list (which are all 0).

3. **Handling different types of inputs**: The function works with tuples and lists containing different types of elements, such as integers, strings, etc.

However, one potential issue is that the `count` method of tuples has a time complexity of O(n), where n is the length of the tuple. This means that if the tuple is very large and the list contains many elements, the function could be slow. Nevertheless, this does not affect the correctness of the function, but rather its performance.

Additionally, the function may raise an error if the list contains non-hashable elements (such as lists or dictionaries) when the tuple contains hashable elements (such as integers or strings). However, this is not a correctness issue as the function description does not explicitly state that it should handle such cases, and the provided unit tests do not cover this scenario.

Overall, the code is correct according to the problem description and provided unit tests.
