Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(tup, lst)` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, counts the occurrences of each element from `lst` in `tup`, and returns the sum of these counts.

The function handles empty inputs correctly by returning `0`, as indicated in the output hints. For example, if `tup` is `()` and `lst` is `[]`, or if `tup` is not empty but does not contain any elements from an empty `lst`, the function will return `0`. This is because the `sum` function with a generator expression will sum up all the counts, and if there are no counts to sum (as in the case of empty inputs), it will return `0`.

The function also correctly counts the occurrences of each element from `lst` in `tup`. If an element from `lst` appears multiple times in `tup`, its count will be accurately reflected in the sum returned by the function.

Furthermore, the function handles cases where `lst` contains duplicate elements. Although the problem description asks to count the occurrences of "all elements of list in a tuple," it does not explicitly state what should happen when `lst` contains duplicates. The provided function will count each occurrence of each element from `lst` in `tup`, regardless of whether that element appears once or multiple times in `lst`. This interpretation seems reasonable, as it ensures that every occurrence of every element specified in `lst` is accounted for in the tuple `tup`.

Given the problem description and the function's behavior, it appears to accurately meet the specified requirements for all potential cases, including edge cases such as empty inputs and lists with duplicate elements.
