Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The problem description asks to count the occurrence of all elements of the list in the tuple, but the provided function only returns the sum of counts of elements from the list as they appear in the tuple.

The function `func_1(tup, lst)` takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as input and returns the sum of counts of elements from `lst` as they appear in `tup`. This means it only counts the elements that are present in both `tup` and `lst`, and returns their total count.

However, the problem description requires the function to count the occurrence of all elements of the list in the tuple. This implies that the function should return a count for each element in the list, not just the sum of counts.

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3]` and `tup = (1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 3)`, the function `func_1(tup, lst)` will return `6`, but the correct output should be a dictionary or a list where each element of `lst` is mapped to its count in `tup`, i.e., `{1: 1, 2: 2, 3: 3}`.

A corrected version of the function could be:

```python
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return {element: tup.count(element) for element in lst}
```

This function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a dictionary where each key is an element from `lst` and its corresponding value is the count of that element in `tup`.
