To determine the final correctness of the program based on the problem description, let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Problem Description**: The problem asks to write a Python function that counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. This means we need a function that takes a tuple and a list as input and returns the total number of occurrences of any element from the list that is found in the tuple.

2. **Original Program**:
   ```python
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count
   ```
   This function works by using a generator expression to iterate over each element in the `elements` list, count the occurrences of each element in the `tup` tuple, and then sum these counts to get the total number of occurrences of all elements from the list in the tuple.

3. **Original Assessment**: None. Since there's no original assessment provided, we will evaluate the program based on the problem description and the annotated code.

4. **Annotated Code**: The annotations provided align with the functionality of the function. The key annotation:
   ```
# The program returns the total count of occurrences in `tup` for all elements present in `elements`, which is the sum of the counts of each element in `elements` found in the tuple `tup`.
   ```
   accurately describes what the function does.

Given this analysis, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description. It counts the occurrences of all elements from the provided list in the given tuple and returns the total count.

**Reasoning for Final Assessment**:
- The function takes a tuple and a list as inputs.
- It correctly counts the occurrences of each element from the list in the tuple.
- It returns the sum of these counts, which represents the total number of occurrences of all elements from the list in the tuple.
- The annotated version confirms this behavior, ensuring that the function acts as intended based on the problem description.

**Final**: **True**
