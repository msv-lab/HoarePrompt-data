Correctness: **True**

The given function `func_1` is designed to count the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. This is achieved by using a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate over each element in the list and count its occurrences in the tuple.

The `tup.count(element)` method is used to count the occurrences of each element in the tuple. This method is case-sensitive and will treat 'a' and 'A' as different elements. 

The function works as expected for all potential cases because:

1. It correctly counts the occurrences of each element in the list within the tuple.
2. It handles duplicate elements in the list correctly by counting their occurrences separately.
3. It handles cases where an element in the list is not present in the tuple by counting its occurrences as 0.

No edge cases have been found where the function does not work as expected. Therefore, the function is correct for all potential cases. 

Example:
```python
print(func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']))  # Output: 3
print(func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]))  # Output: 6
print(func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]))  # Output: 2
```
These examples demonstrate the function's correctness in handling different scenarios.
