You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2

def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to count the occurrences of each element from the list in the tuple. The `count` method of the tuple is used to count the occurrences of each element.

Here's why the code is correct in every case:

- The function takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements` as input, which matches the problem description.
- It uses `tup.count(element)` to count the occurrences of each `element` in the tuple, which is the correct method to count occurrences in a tuple.
- The `sum` function adds up the counts of all elements from the list in the tuple, providing the total count as required by the problem description.
- The function handles tuples and lists of any length and does not have any built-in limitations that would cause incorrect results for certain inputs.
- The provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness for various scenarios.

Since the code correctly implements the described functionality and no edge cases have been found where it does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and elements is a list.
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum(tup.count(element) for element in elements)
    return count
    #The program returns the total count of occurrences in `tup` for all elements present in `elements`, which is the sum of the counts of each element in `elements` found in the tuple `tup`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
