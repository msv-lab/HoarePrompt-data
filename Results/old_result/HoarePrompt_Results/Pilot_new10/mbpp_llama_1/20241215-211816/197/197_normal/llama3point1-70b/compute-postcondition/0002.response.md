To determine the functionality of the function, let's analyze the code step by step.

1. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `lst`, which are described as a tuple and a list, respectively.

2. The function uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to count the occurrences of each element from `lst` as they appear in `tup`. This is achieved by using the `count` method of the tuple `tup` for each element in `lst`.

3. The return value is the sum of these counts.

4. Looking at the code line by line, it directly implements what the annotation describes: counting the occurrences of elements from `lst` in `tup` and summing these counts.

5. Potential edge cases include:
   - If `lst` is empty, the function will return `0` because the generator expression will be empty.
   - If `tup` is empty but `lst` is not, the function will still return `0` for each element in `lst` since `tup.count(element)` will always return `0` for any `element` in `lst`.
   - If both `tup` and `lst` are empty, the function will return `0`.
   - The function does not handle cases where `tup` or `lst` might not be of the correct type (tuple and list, respectively), but based on the provided code, it assumes these types.
   - The function does not handle potential exceptions that might occur if the elements in `tup` and `lst` are not hashable (though this would be more of an issue with sets or dictionaries, the `count` method should work with any type of object that can be compared for equality).

Given this analysis, the functionality of the function is to accept a tuple and a list, count the occurrences of each element from the list as they appear in the tuple, and return the sum of these counts. It handles edge cases where either or both inputs are empty by returning `0`, and it assumes that the inputs are indeed a tuple and a list.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, counts the occurrences of each element from `lst` in `tup`, and returns the sum of these counts, handling empty inputs by returning `0`. **
