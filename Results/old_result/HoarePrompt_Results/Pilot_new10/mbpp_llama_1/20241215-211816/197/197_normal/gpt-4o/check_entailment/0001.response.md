Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to count the occurrences of each element from the list in the tuple. The `count` method of the tuple is used to count the occurrences of each element.

Here's why the code is correct in every case:

- The function takes a tuple `tup` and a list `elements` as input, which matches the problem description.
- It uses `tup.count(element)` to count the occurrences of each `element` in the tuple, which is the correct method to count occurrences in a tuple.
- The `sum` function adds up the counts of all elements from the list in the tuple, providing the total count as required by the problem description.
- The function handles tuples and lists of any length and does not have any built-in limitations that would cause incorrect results for certain inputs.
- The provided unit tests demonstrate its correctness for various scenarios.

Since the code correctly implements the described functionality and no edge cases have been found where it does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is confirmed.
