You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum((tup.count(element) for element in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1(tup, lst)` counts the occurrence of all elements of a list in a tuple. It uses the built-in `count` method of Python tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in the tuple. The function uses a generator expression to calculate the sum of occurrences of all elements in the list.

This function works correctly for all potential cases:

- It correctly handles cases where the list contains duplicate elements, as `tup.count(element)` is called for each element in the list.
- It correctly handles cases where the tuple contains duplicate elements, as `tup.count(element)` returns the total count of the element in the tuple.
- It correctly handles cases where an element is present in the list but not in the tuple, as `tup.count(element)` returns 0 for such elements.
- It correctly handles cases where the list and tuple are empty, as `sum` returns 0 for an empty iterable.

For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2, 2, 3), [2, 3, 4])`, the function returns 3, which is the correct count of occurrences of elements in the list (2 appears twice in the tuple and 3 appears once, while 4 appears 0 times).

Therefore, the function works as expected according to the problem description, and its correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and lst is a list.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the sum of counts of elements from list `lst` as they appear in tuple `tup`.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
