#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and elements is a list.
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum(tup.count(element) for element in elements)
    return count
    #The program returns the total count of occurrences in `tup` for all elements present in `elements`, which is the sum of the counts of each element in `elements` found in the tuple `tup`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple and a list, and returns the total count of occurrences in the tuple for all elements present in the list, handling empty inputs, duplicate elements in the list, and potentially other types of inputs, but may raise errors for non-hashable elements in the list.
