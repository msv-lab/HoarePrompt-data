To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.
- `result` is `(low + high) // 2`, which means `result` equals `mid`.

The code `high = mid - 1` updates the value of `high` to be one less than `mid`. Since `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`, updating `high` to `mid - 1` effectively changes the range within which `mid` and other variables are defined.

However, it's crucial to note that `low` remains unchanged, as does the list `arr`, the integer `target`, and the value of `result` (which was set to `mid` before `high` was updated). The new value of `high` is now `mid - 1`, where `mid` is still the original `(low + high) // 2` before the update. After the update, the relationship between `low`, `mid`, and `high` changes, with `high` being less than `mid` by one.

Given that `mid` was `(low + high) // 2` and now `high` is `mid - 1`, we can express the new `high` in terms of the original `low` and `high` as follows:
- Original `mid` = `(low + high) // 2`.
- New `high` = `mid - 1` = `((low + high) // 2) - 1`.

The value of `result` remains `(low + high) // 2`, which is the original `mid`. The list `arr` and the integer `target` are unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` is less than or equal to the new `high`, where the new `high` is `mid - 1` or more precisely, `high` is now `((low + original high) // 2) - 1`.
- `mid` is still `(low + original high) // 2`, but now `mid` is greater than the new `high` by 1.
- `result` equals the original `mid`, which is `(low + original high) // 2`.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, where `high` is `((low + original high) // 2) - 1`, `mid` is `(low + original high) // 2` and is greater than the new `high` by 1, `result` equals the original `mid` which is `(low + original high) // 2`.**
