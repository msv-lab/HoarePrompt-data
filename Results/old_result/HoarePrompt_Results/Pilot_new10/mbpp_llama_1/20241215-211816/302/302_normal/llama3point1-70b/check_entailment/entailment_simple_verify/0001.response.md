The original assessment claims that the program is not correct because it does not check if the input array is sorted, and it does not handle the case where the input array is empty. However, based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, it is clear that the program assumes that the input array will always be sorted and non-empty.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function will return the index of the first occurrence of the given number in the sorted array, or -1 if the number is not found. This matches the problem description, which asks for the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment is not accurate. The program is correct based on the problem description and the provided code, assuming that the input array will always be sorted and non-empty.

Final: **True**
