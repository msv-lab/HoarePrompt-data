The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. The value of `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Given that `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2` and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, `high` becomes `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 - 1`. 

Also, since the value at the index `mid` in `arr` is greater than or equal to `target`, and `mid` is no longer included in the range `[low, high]`, the value of `result` is still -1.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 - 1`, `result` is -1, and `mid` is `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`**
