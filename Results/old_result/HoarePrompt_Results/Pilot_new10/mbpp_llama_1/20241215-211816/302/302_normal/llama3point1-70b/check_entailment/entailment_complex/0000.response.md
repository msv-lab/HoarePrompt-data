The given program does not correctly implement the problem description as stated. 

The problem description requires the function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. However, the provided program does not take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted. It performs a linear search, which is correct for unsorted arrays but not the most efficient approach for sorted arrays. 

More importantly, when the number is not found in the array, the function is supposed to return -1, but it first returns implicitly `None` and then has a return statement with -1 which is unreachable and does not meet the requirements as stated in the problem description, because after finding `num`, the function will immediately return the index without reaching the `return -1` statement.

For instance, when `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `num = 3`, the function will return `2`, which is correct. But when `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `num = 6`, the function will only return `None` because the `return -1` is unreachable, which is incorrect.

The reason it does not always follow the problem description is that it doesn't have a clear return statement for when `num` is not found in `arr`. 

A correct version of this function, following the problem description and taking advantage of the sorted nature of the array, could utilize a binary search algorithm. However, even a linear search approach, if properly implemented with a clear return statement for the "not found" case, would meet the requirements.

Correctness: **False**
