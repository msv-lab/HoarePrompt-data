You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. It simply returns the index of the first occurrence of the given number in the array, without considering whether the array is sorted or not.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the input array is not sorted. For example, if the input array is [3, 1, 2, 3, 4] and the target number is 3, the program will return 0, which is the index of the first occurrence of 3 in the array. However, since the array is not sorted, the function should ideally raise an error or return a special value to indicate that the input array is not valid.

Additionally, the problem description does not specify what to do if the input array is empty. The function will return -1 in this case, which may or may not be the desired behavior.

However, if we assume that the input array will always be sorted and non-empty, the function is correct. It iterates over the array and returns the index of the first element that matches the target number, or -1 if no such element is found. 

Here's an example of how you could modify the function to handle these edge cases:

```python
def func_1(arr, num):
    if not arr:
        raise ValueError("Input array is empty")
    if arr!= sorted(arr):
        raise ValueError("Input array is not sorted")
    try:
        return arr.index(num)
    except ValueError:
        return -1
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of integers, and num is an integer.
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `num` is an integer, and if `num` is in `arr`, the function returns the index of `num`; otherwise, the function implicitly returns `None`, indicating `num` is not in `arr`. If the loop executes, `i` and `x` will have values based on the last iteration or the iteration where `num` was found, but these are not directly accessible outside the function due to its return behavior.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
