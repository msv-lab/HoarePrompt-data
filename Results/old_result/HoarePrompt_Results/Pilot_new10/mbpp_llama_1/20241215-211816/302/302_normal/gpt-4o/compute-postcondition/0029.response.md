Postcondition: ***`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`. If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, then `result` equals `mid` which is `(low + high) // 2` based on the original `low` and `high`, and `high` equals `mid - 1`. Otherwise, if `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `((low + high) // 2) + 1` and `mid` is updated to be the average of the new `low` and `high`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1` and `mid` is updated to be the average of the original `low` and the new `high`.***
