Postcondition: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, initially `low` was 0, initially `high` was `len(arr) - 1`, initially `result` was -1, and initially `mid` was `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`. The value at the index `mid` in `arr` is not equal to `target`. The current value of `arr[mid]` is less than the current value of `target`.**
