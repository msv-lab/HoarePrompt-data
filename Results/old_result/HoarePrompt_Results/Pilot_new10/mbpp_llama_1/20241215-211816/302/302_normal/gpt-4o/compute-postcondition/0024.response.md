The code assigns the value of `mid` to the variable `result`. The value of `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`. 

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` equals `(low + high) // 2`, and `result` equals `mid` which is `(low + high) // 2`**
