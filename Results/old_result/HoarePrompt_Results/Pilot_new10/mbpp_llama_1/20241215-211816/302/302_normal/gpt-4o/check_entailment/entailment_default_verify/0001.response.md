The original assessment appears to be accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The code correctly implements a modified binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The algorithm iteratively adjusts the `low` and `high` pointers to search for the first occurrence of the target element.

The output hints provided also align with the problem description, indicating that the function returns the index of the first occurrence of the target element in the sorted list if found, and -1 otherwise. The code handles various edge cases, including empty arrays, single-element arrays, target not found, and duplicate elements.

The original assessment correctly identifies the handling of these edge cases and provides a thorough explanation of the code's behavior. The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correct behavior of the function for different scenarios.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
