The function `func_1` accepts a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `num`. It iterates through the list to find the index of `num`. If `num` is found, the function returns its index. However, the provided code and annotations suggest that the function should return `-1` if `num` is not found, but there's an inconsistency in the return behavior described. The loop's behavior and the initial return statement imply that if `num` is not found, the function should implicitly return `None`, but the explicit return statement at the end suggests it returns `-1` in such cases. However, this return statement is unreachable due to the loop's return behavior.

Upon closer inspection, it becomes clear that the function essentially performs a simple search for `num` in `arr`. The return postconditions (Case_1, Case_2, Case_3, Case_4) hint at specific return values, but these do not fully align with the behavior described by the code and annotations. Notably, the code does not have conditional logic to return 0, 1, or 2 specifically based on any conditions other than finding `num` in `arr`. The return of `-1` if `num` is not found is explicitly stated but contradicts the implicit return behavior due to the function's structure.

Given this analysis, the functionality of `func_1` is to search for an integer `num` in a sorted list `arr`. If `num` is found, the function returns its index. If `num` is not found, despite the annotation suggesting a return of `-1`, the actual code behavior is to implicitly return `None` due to the function's return structure. However, considering the explicit return statement (even though it's technically unreachable in the provided code structure), and for the sake of summarizing based on what the code aims to achieve:

Functionality: ** The function searches for an integer `num` in a sorted list `arr`, returning the index of `num` if found, and implicitly `None` (though intended to be `-1` based on the code's last statement) if `num` is not in `arr`, covering all potential cases including edge cases where `num` is at the start, middle, or end of `arr`, or not in `arr` at all. **
