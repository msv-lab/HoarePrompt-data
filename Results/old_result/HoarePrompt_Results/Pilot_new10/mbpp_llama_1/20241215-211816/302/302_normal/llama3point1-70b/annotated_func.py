#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a sorted list of integers, and num is an integer.
def func_1(arr, num):
    for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
        if x == num:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `num` is an integer, and if `num` is in `arr`, the function returns the index of `num`; otherwise, the function implicitly returns `None`, indicating `num` is not in `arr`. If the loop executes, `i` and `x` will have values based on the last iteration or the iteration where `num` was found, but these are not directly accessible outside the function due to its return behavior.
    return -1
    #The program returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function searches for an integer `num` in a sorted list `arr`, returning the index of `num` if found, and implicitly `None` (though intended to be `-1` based on the code's last statement) if `num` is not in `arr`, covering all potential cases including edge cases where `num` is at the start, middle, or end of `arr`, or not in `arr` at all.
