Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple linear search function that iterates over the array to find the first occurrence of the given number. Although the problem description mentions a sorted array, the algorithm used here does not take advantage of the fact that the array is sorted. However, it still works correctly for every potential case, including edge cases where the number is at the start, middle, or end of the array, or not in the array at all.

The output hints agree with the code and suggest that the function covers all potential cases, returning the index of `num` if found and `-1` if `num` is not in `arr`. 

The only potential issue is that the function does not explicitly handle cases where the input array is empty or `None`, but Python's built-in `enumerate` function will throw an exception in such cases, which might be considered the correct behavior. Additionally, the function's time complexity is O(n), which could be improved to O(log n) if a binary search algorithm were used, taking advantage of the fact that the array is sorted.

However, based on the given problem description and output hints, the code does what it is supposed to do for every potential case, so the correctness is True.
