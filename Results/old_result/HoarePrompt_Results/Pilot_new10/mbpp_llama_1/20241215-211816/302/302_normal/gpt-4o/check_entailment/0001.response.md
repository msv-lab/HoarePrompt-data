Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses a modified binary search algorithm to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The code iteratively adjusts the `low` and `high` pointers based on the comparison of the `mid` element with the target element. If the `mid` element matches the target, it updates the `result` with the current `mid` index and adjusts the `high` pointer to `mid - 1` to continue searching for the first occurrence on the left side.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears to correctly handle the following edge cases:

1.  **Empty array**: Although not explicitly tested, the code should return `-1` for an empty array since the `while` loop condition would be `False` and the function would return the initial `result` value of `-1`.
2.  **Single-element array**: If the array contains only one element and it matches the target, the function correctly returns `0`. If the single element does not match the target, it returns `-1`.
3.  **Target not found**: If the target element is not present in the array, the function correctly returns `-1`.
4.  **Duplicate elements**: The code correctly handles arrays with duplicate elements by continuing to search for the first occurrence on the left side when a match is found.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correct behavior for various scenarios. Without being able to think of a counterexample where the code does not work as expected, it appears that the program is correct.
