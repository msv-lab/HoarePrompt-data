The original assessment claims that the program is correct, stating that it finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array, and if the number is not found, it returns -1. The annotated version of the code supports this claim by showing the state of the program before and after the function call.

However, there is a discrepancy in the annotated version of the code. It states that if `num` is not in `arr`, the function implicitly returns `None`, which is incorrect. The function explicitly returns -1 if `num` is not in `arr`.

Despite this discrepancy, the logic of the function remains sound. It iterates through the array from left to right, ensuring that it finds the first occurrence of `num` if it exists. If `num` is not found, it correctly returns -1.

The original assessment also mentions that a more efficient solution could be implemented using binary search, but this does not affect the correctness of the provided function.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
