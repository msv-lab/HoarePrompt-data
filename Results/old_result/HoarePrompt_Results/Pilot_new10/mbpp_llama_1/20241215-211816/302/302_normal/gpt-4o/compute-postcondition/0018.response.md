The given code updates the value of `low` to `mid + 1`. The initial state provides the following information: `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`. 

Since `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, the updated value of `low` is `((low + high) // 2) + 1`. The values of `arr`, `target`, and `high` remain unchanged. The relationship between `low` and `high` is also updated, as `low` is now greater than its previous value.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is `((low + high) // 2) + 1`, `high` is `high`, and `low` is less than or equal to `high`.**
