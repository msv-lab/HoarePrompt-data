To calculate the output state, we first analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state provides a non-empty sorted list of integers `arr`, an integer `target`, and specifies that `low` must be less than or equal to `high`. The given code calculates the `mid` index as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2.

Given the code:
```python
mid = (low + high) // 2
```

The impact of this code is to calculate an integer midpoint `mid` between `low` and `high`. Since `low` and `high` are related to indices in a list and must adhere to the constraint that `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` will be an integer value that represents an index between `low` and `high`, inclusive, because integer division in Python rounds down to the nearest whole number.

Considering the initial state constraints:
- `arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` is an integer.
- `low` must be less than or equal to `high`.

And the effect of the code:
- `mid` is assigned the value `(low + high) // 2`, which is the index of the middle element between `low` and `high`.

The output state reflects the updated information:
- `arr` remains a non-empty sorted list of integers.
- `target` remains an integer.
- `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
- `mid` is the integer average of `low` and `high`, calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.

Therefore, the output state includes the original constraints and the newly calculated `mid` value.

Output State: **`arr` is a non-empty sorted list of integers, `target` is an integer, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, and `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`.**
