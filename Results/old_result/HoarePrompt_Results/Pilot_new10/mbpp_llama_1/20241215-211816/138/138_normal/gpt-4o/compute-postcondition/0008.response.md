The `index` is given as 2, and we know that `index` corresponds to the position of the third element in the list `arr` because list indices in Python start at 0. The `return` statement includes `True` and `index`. 

Given that `index` is 2, we can conclude that the program returns a boolean value `True` and the value of `index`, which is 2.

Output State: **The program returns True and the index, which is 2**
