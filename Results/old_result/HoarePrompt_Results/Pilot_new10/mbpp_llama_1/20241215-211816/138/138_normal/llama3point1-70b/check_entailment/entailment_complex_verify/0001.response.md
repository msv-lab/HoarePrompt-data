Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I have examined the information provided to determine the correctness of the program.

The problem description requires a function that takes in an array and an element, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array, and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The original assessment states that the program is correct because it uses the built-in `index()` method of Python lists to find the index of the given element, handles the case where the element is not found by catching the `ValueError` exception, and returns a tuple with `True` and the index if the element is found, or `False` and `-1` if not found.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the program correctly handles the cases where the element is found and not found, and returns the expected tuples.

However, it's worth noting that the annotated version also mentions that the function "does not explicitly handle cases where `array` is not a list or where `element` appears multiple times in `array`." This could potentially be a concern, but since the problem description implicitly assumes valid input, and the annotations and original assessment consider this, it does not affect the correctness of the program based on the given assumptions.

Given the information and the assumptions of valid input, the original assessment's reasoning about the program's correctness holds true. The program does indeed meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Final: **True**
