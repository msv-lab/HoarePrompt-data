Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function takes in an array and an element as inputs, which aligns with the problem description.
2. The function uses the `index()` method to find the index position of the element in the array. If the element is found, it returns `True` along with the index position.
3. If the element is not found in the array, the `index()` method raises a `ValueError`, which is caught by the `except` block. In this case, the function returns `False` along with `-1`, indicating that the element is not found.
4. The function handles cases where the element is not in the array, but it also works correctly when the element is found.
5. Although the function does not explicitly handle cases where `array` is not a list or where `element` appears multiple times in `array`, the `index()` method will still work correctly in these cases. If `array` is not a list, the `index()` method will raise a `TypeError` or `AttributeError`, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description. If `element` appears multiple times in `array`, the `index()` method will return the index of the first occurrence, which is a reasonable behavior.

The only potential edge case not explicitly handled is when `array` is not a list or other iterable, but this is not mentioned in the problem description as a requirement.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description, the program is correct and meets the requirements.
