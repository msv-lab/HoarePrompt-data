The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `array` and `element`. `array` is a list of elements, and `element` is a value that can be compared with the elements in the `array`. After executing the function body, if `element` is found in `array`, the function returns `True` along with the index of `element`; otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `array` and a value `element`, and return whether `element` is present in `array` along with its index if found, or indicate its absence.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `array` and a value `element`, returns `True` and the index of `element` if `element` is found in `array`; otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1`.**
