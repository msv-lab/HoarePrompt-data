The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**, and after reviewing the annotated version of the code, I believe this assessment remains accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function behaves as expected: it returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). The annotations provided align with the expected behavior of the function as described in the problem description.

The key points supporting the accuracy of the original assessment are:

1. The function uses the built-in `index()` method of Python lists, which effectively finds the index of the given element if it exists in the list.
2. The function correctly handles the case where the element is not found by catching the `ValueError` exception raised by the `index()` method and returning a tuple with `False` and `-1`.
3. The annotations in the code confirm the state of the program before and after the execution of the try-except block, which matches the expected behavior described in the problem description and the original assessment.

Therefore, considering the problem description, the original code, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I conclude that the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.

Final: **True**
