The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and an `element` of any comparable type. It iterates through the list to find the `element`. If the `element` is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the first occurrence of the `element`. If the `element` is not found in the list, it returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.

Upon analyzing the code line by line, it appears to correctly implement the described functionality without any obvious missing logic or incorrect annotations. However, it's worth noting that the function does not handle cases where the input `arr` is not a list or where the `element` is not comparable. Additionally, the function returns as soon as it finds the first occurrence of the `element`, which is the expected behavior based on the provided annotations.

Considering potential edge cases:
- If `arr` is an empty list, the function will return `False` and `-1` because the loop will not be executed.
- If `element` is not in `arr`, the function will return `False` and `-1`.
- If `arr` contains duplicate elements and `element` is one of them, the function will return the index of the first occurrence of `element`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function encompasses finding an element in a list and returning its presence along with its index if found, or indicating its absence with a specific index value if not found.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list and an element, returning a tuple containing True and the index of the element if it exists in the list, or False and -1 if it does not, covering cases for empty lists and lists with duplicate elements. **
