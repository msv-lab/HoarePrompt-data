Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

Here's a breakdown of why the function works correctly:

1. The function iterates over the array using `enumerate`, which returns both the index and the value of each element.
2. If the current value is equal to the target element, the function immediately returns a tuple containing `True` and the current index.
3. If the function iterates over the entire array without finding the target element, it returns a tuple containing `False` and -1.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases:

* When the element is present in the array, the function returns the correct index.
* The function correctly handles arrays with different lengths and elements.

Since the function handles all possible cases correctly, including the case when the element is not found in the array, the program is correct. The function does not have any edge cases that it does not handle, and it behaves as expected according to the problem description.
