Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an array and an element as input. It iterates through the array using the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index and value of each element. If the element is found, the function immediately returns a tuple containing `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found after iterating through the entire array, the function returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`.

The code handles all potential cases, including:

1.  The element is present in the array: The function returns `True` and the index of the element.
2.  The element is not present in the array: The function returns `False` and `-1`.
3.  The array is empty: The function will still return `False` and `-1` because the `enumerate` function will simply not iterate over any elements.
4.  The array contains duplicate elements: The function will return the index of the first occurrence of the element.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that it correctly handles these cases. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios. Since the code handles all potential cases and agrees with the problem description, output hints, and unit tests, it is considered correct.
