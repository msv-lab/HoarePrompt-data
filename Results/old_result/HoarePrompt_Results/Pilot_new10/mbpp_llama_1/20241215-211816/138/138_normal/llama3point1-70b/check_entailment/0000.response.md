Correctness: **True**.

I have analyzed the given program and found that it correctly implements the function as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The program uses the `index` method of the array to find the index of the element. If the element is found, the `index` method returns its index, and the function returns a tuple with `True` and the index. If the element is not found, the `index` method raises a `ValueError` exception, which is caught by the `except` block, and the function returns a tuple with `False` and -1.

I have considered the following potential cases:

* The element is present in the array: In this case, the `index` method will return the correct index, and the function will return a tuple with `True` and the index.
* The element is not present in the array: In this case, the `index` method will raise a `ValueError` exception, which will be caught by the `except` block, and the function will return a tuple with `False` and -1.
* The array is empty: In this case, the `index` method will raise a `ValueError` exception, which will be caught by the `except` block, and the function will return a tuple with `False` and -1.

In all these cases, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
