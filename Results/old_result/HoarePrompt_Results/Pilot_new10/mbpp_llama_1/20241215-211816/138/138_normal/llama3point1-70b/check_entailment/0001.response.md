Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(array, element)` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes an array and an element as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if not found).

Here's why the code is correct:

- The function uses the built-in `index()` method of Python lists to find the index of the given element. If the element is found, this method returns its index, which the function then uses to return a tuple with `True` and the index.
- If the element is not found in the array, the `index()` method raises a `ValueError` exception, which the function catches. In this case, it returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`, as specified in the problem description.
- This approach handles all potential cases:
  - If the element is in the array, the function correctly returns its index.
  - If the element is not in the array, the function returns `-1` for the index, as required.
  - It does not have to handle the case where the array is `None` or `element` is `None` separately, as attempting to call `index()` on `None` will raise an `AttributeError`, and this is not within the scope of the specified problem description which implicitly assumes valid input.

The function is concise, readable, and effectively meets the requirements for every potential case that aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the provided Python program is **True**.
