The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `element`. `arr` is a list, and `element` is any type of object that can be compared for equality. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value and an index. The boolean value is always True in Cases 1, 2, and 3, and False in Case 4. The index returned varies: in Case 1, it is 0; in Case 2, it is 1; in Case 3, it is 2; and in Case 4, it is -1. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an `element`, and return a boolean value indicating the presence of the element in the list along with an index, which seems to represent the position of the element in the list if found, or -1 if not found.
