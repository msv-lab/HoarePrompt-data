The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the provided problem description and code. The code correctly implements the function as described in the problem description. It returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The output hints provided also align with the original assessment. They state that the function returns a tuple with the first element being `True` if the element is found in the array and `False` otherwise, and the second element being the index of the element if it is found or -1 if not found. This is consistent with the behavior described in the original assessment.

The output hints do mention that the function does not explicitly handle cases where `array` is not a list or where `element` appears multiple times in `array`. However, as mentioned in the problem description, it is assumed that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, the program is still correct under the given assumptions.

The original assessment considered the potential cases where the element is present in the array, not present in the array, and the array is empty. The code behaves as expected in all these cases.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
