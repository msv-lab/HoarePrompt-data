The `return True, index` statement indicates that the program returns two values: a boolean `True` and the value of `index`. 
Given that `index` is 0, the program returns `True` and `0`. 
The value of `index` is 0 because it was initialized as 0 in the initial state.

Output State: **The program returns True and 0**
