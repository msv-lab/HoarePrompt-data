The original assessment of the program's correctness was **True**, and after reviewing the annotated version of the code, I agree with this assessment. The provided code correctly implements the function as described in the problem description.

The annotated version of the code accurately describes the state of the program at different points and confirms that the function behaves as expected. The function returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). The try-except block is used to handle the case where the element is not in the array, and the function returns the expected values in both cases.

The annotated code also mentions that the function does not explicitly handle cases where `array` is not a list or where `element` appears multiple times in `array`. However, according to the problem description, we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. Therefore, these cases are not considered errors in the program.

I do not see any issues with the original assessment, and I believe it is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The program correctly implements the desired functionality, and the annotations confirm this.

Final: **True**
