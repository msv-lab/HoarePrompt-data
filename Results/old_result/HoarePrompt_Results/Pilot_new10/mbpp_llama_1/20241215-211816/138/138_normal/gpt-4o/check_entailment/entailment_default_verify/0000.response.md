The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The code correctly implements the problem description, taking an array and an element as input and returning a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for various cases. 

The output hints provided also support the original assessment, stating that the function covers cases for empty lists and lists with duplicate elements, although the code does not explicitly handle these cases, it inherently handles them due to the nature of the for loop and the return statements.

However, it's worth noting that the function does not explicitly handle the case of an empty list, but since the problem statement assumes valid input and the function will simply return (False, -1) for an empty list, this is not necessarily an issue.

Additionally, the function only returns the index of the first occurrence of the element if there are duplicate elements in the list. This is also consistent with the problem description, which does not specify what to do in the case of duplicate elements.

Overall, based on the problem description, the code, and the output hints, the original assessment appears to be accurate.

Final: **True**
