#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in `list_of_lists`, but sorted in a case-insensitive alphabetical order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists of strings, and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but sorted in a case-insensitive alphabetical order, assuming the input is a list of lists containing only strings
