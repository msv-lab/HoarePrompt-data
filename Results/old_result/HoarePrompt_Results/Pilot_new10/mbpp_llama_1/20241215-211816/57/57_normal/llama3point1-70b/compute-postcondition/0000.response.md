The code is iterating over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and sorting the strings in each sublist in a case-insensitive manner. This means that the sorting will treat 'A' and 'a' as the same letter, rather than 'A' coming before 'a' as it would in a standard sort.

Output State: **The program returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in `list_of_lists`, but sorted in a case-insensitive alphabetical order**
