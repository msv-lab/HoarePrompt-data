You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The function utilizes a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists. For each sublist, it applies the `sorted` function with a `key` argument set to `str.lower`, which ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive.

This function should work correctly for all potential cases because it handles the following scenarios:

- **Empty sublists**: The `sorted` function will return an empty list when applied to an empty sublist, which is the expected result.
- **Sublists with a single element**: The `sorted` function will return the sublist itself when applied to a sublist with a single element, which is the expected result since a list with one element is already sorted.
- **Sublists with duplicate elements**: The `sorted` function is stable, meaning that when multiple records have the same key, their original order is preserved.
- **Sublists with strings containing non-alphabet characters**: The `str.lower` method works correctly with strings containing non-alphabet characters.
- **Sublists with different lengths**: The list comprehension will handle sublists of varying lengths correctly.

Since the function handles these edge cases and sorts the sublists as expected, it is correct according to the provided problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists of strings, and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but sorted in a case-insensitive alphabetical order, assuming the input is a list of lists containing only strings

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
