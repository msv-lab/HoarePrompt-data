Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension with the built-in `sorted` function to achieve this. 

The `sorted` function returns a new sorted list from the elements of any sequence. By default, it sorts the elements in ascending order. For strings, this means sorting alphabetically. 

Since the function correctly sorts each sublist of strings in ascending alphabetical order, regardless of the original order of the strings, and it handles all provided test cases correctly, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Additionally, the function does not modify the original list, which is a desirable behavior in many scenarios, and it works with sublists of varying lengths. 

Therefore, the function is correct for all potential cases, and the Correctness is **True**.
