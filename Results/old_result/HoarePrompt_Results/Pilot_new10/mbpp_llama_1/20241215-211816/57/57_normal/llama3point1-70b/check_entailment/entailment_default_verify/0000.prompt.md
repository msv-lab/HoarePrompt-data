You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given function, `func_1`, is designed to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. It uses a list comprehension to achieve this. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:

- The function takes a `list_of_lists` as input, where each sublist contains strings.
- The `sorted` function is applied to each sublist, which sorts the strings in ascending order.
- The `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive. This means that 'a' and 'A' are treated as the same character.

For example, if the input is `[["hello", "World"], ["abc", "xyz", "ABC"]]`, the output will be `[["hello", "World"], ["ABC", "abc", "xyz"]]`.

Since the function correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a case-insensitive manner, and it handles all potential cases (including empty sublists, single-element sublists, and sublists with multiple elements), I conclude that the program is correct.

To further verify the correctness of the function, you can test it with different inputs, such as:

- Empty list of lists: `func_1([])` returns `[]`
- List of lists with empty sublists: `func_1([[], []])` returns `[[], []]`
- List of lists with single-element sublists: `func_1([["a"], ["b"]])` returns `[["a"], ["b"]]`
- List of lists with multiple-element sublists: `func_1([["c", "a", "b"], ["d", "e", "f"]])` returns `[["a", "b", "c"], ["d", "e", "f"]]`
- List of lists with sublists containing mixed-case strings: `func_1([["Hello", "world"], ["abc", "XYZ"]])` returns `[["Hello", "world"], ["abc", "XYZ"]]`

All of these test cases produce the expected output, which confirms that the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of lists of strings, and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but sorted in a case-insensitive alphabetical order, assuming the input is a list of lists containing only strings

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
