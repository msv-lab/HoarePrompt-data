The function accepts a list of lists of strings, sorts each sublist in ascending order, and returns the sorted list of lists. It assumes the input structure is correct and does not handle invalid or nested structures beyond the first level, potentially raising errors for non-comparable elements, null inputs, or if the input is not a list of lists.
