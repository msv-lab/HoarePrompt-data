Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem requires a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. 

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input, where each sublist contains strings.

2. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists.

3. For each sublist, the `sorted` function is used to sort the strings in ascending order. 

4. The sorted sublists are then returned as a list of lists, maintaining the same structure as the original input.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for different input cases, including lists with strings of different lengths and containing leading/trailing spaces.

The function is robust and handles all potential cases because it does not make any assumptions about the input data, such as the length of the strings or the number of sublists. It simply sorts each sublist of strings in ascending order, regardless of the input.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided unit tests, it can be concluded that the program is correct and always produces the expected output.
