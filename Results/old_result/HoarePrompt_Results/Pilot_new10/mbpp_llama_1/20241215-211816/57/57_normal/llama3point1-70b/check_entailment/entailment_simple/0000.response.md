Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists of strings as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but sorted in a case-insensitive alphabetical order.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input `list_of_lists`.
2. For each sublist, it uses the `sorted` function to sort the strings in a case-insensitive alphabetical order. The `key=str.lower` argument ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive, so that uppercase letters are treated the same as lowercase letters.
3. The sorted sublists are then collected into a new list of lists, which is returned by the function.

This implementation correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the input list of lists, as required by the problem description. It handles all potential cases, including:

* Sublists with a mix of uppercase and lowercase letters
* Sublists with duplicate strings
* Sublists with an empty string or a string with only whitespace
* An empty input list or an input list with no sublists

Overall, the program is correct because it accurately implements the required functionality and handles all potential edge cases.
