Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code uses a list comprehension to sort each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The `sorted` function is used with the `key` argument set to `str.lower`, which ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive. This means that the code will treat 'a' and 'A' as the same character when sorting, which aligns with the problem description.

The output hints also agree with the code, stating that the function returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but sorted in a case-insensitive alphabetical order.

We can verify this by considering various potential cases:

* An empty list of lists: The code will return an empty list of lists, which is correct.
* A list of lists with a single sublist containing a single string: The code will return the same list of lists, which is correct.
* A list of lists with multiple sublists containing multiple strings: The code will sort each sublist correctly, regardless of the number of sublists or the number of strings in each sublist.
* A list of lists containing sublists with duplicate strings: The code will sort each sublist correctly, preserving any duplicate strings.
* A list of lists containing sublists with strings in a non-alphabetical order: The code will sort each sublist correctly, placing the strings in a case-insensitive alphabetical order.

Since we cannot find a case where the program does not work as expected, we conclude that the code is correct for every potential case.
