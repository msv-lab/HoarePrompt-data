Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists of strings as input and returns a new list of lists where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but sorted in a case-insensitive alphabetical order.

Here's a breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function is designed to handle a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings. This matches the problem description.

2. **Sorting Sublists**: The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list. For each sublist, it applies the `sorted` function with `key=str.lower`, which sorts the strings in a case-insensitive manner. This aligns with the requirement to sort each sublist of strings.

3. **Case-Insensitive Sorting**: The use of `key=str.lower` in the `sorted` function ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive. This means that strings starting with lowercase letters are treated the same as strings starting with the corresponding uppercase letters during the sorting process, which meets the problem's requirements.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns a new list of lists, where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in the input, but sorted. This output matches the problem description, indicating that the function correctly sorts each sublist of strings without modifying the original list.

5. **Handling Potential Cases**: The program handles various potential cases correctly, including:
   - Empty sublists: These will be returned as empty sublists, which is the expected behavior.
   - Sublists with a single element: These will be returned unchanged, which aligns with the problem description since a single-element list is already sorted.
   - Sublists with duplicate strings: These will be sorted correctly and duplicates will be preserved, maintaining the original count of each string.
   - Sublists containing strings with different cases: The case-insensitive sorting ensures that strings are sorted correctly regardless of their case.

In conclusion, the provided Python program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists according to the problem description. It handles various potential cases and returns the expected output, making it a correct implementation of the specified functionality.
