Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the original assessment is accurate.

The problem description requires writing a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that does exactly that. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist in the input list of lists and applies the `sorted` function with a `key` argument set to `str.lower` to sort the strings in a case-insensitive alphabetical order.

The original assessment correctly identifies the edge cases that the function handles, including empty sublists, sublists with a single element, sublists with duplicate elements, sublists with strings containing non-alphabet characters, and sublists with different lengths.

The annotated version of the code also confirms that the function returns a list of lists, where each sublist contains the same strings as the corresponding sublist in `list_of_lists`, but sorted in a case-insensitive alphabetical order. This matches the expected output described in the problem description.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment is accurate because the function correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists, handles various edge cases, and returns the expected output.

Final: **True**
