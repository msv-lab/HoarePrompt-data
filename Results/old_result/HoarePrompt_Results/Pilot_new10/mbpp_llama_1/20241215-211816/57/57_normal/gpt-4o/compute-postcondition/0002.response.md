To analyze the given function, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Parameters and Return Type**: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists where each sublist contains strings. The function returns a list of lists as well.

2. **Functionality**: The function uses a list comprehension to sort each sublist within `list_of_lists`. The operation `[sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]` iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists`, sorts the strings within each sublist in ascending order (due to the default behavior of Python's `sorted` function), and returns a new list of lists with the sorted sublists.

3. **Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - **Empty Sublists**: If any of the sublists within `list_of_lists` are empty, the function will simply return an empty sublist in the corresponding position in the output, as sorting an empty list results in an empty list.
   - **Non-String Elements**: If any sublist contains elements that are not strings, the function will still attempt to sort these elements. However, if the non-string elements are not comparable (e.g., mixing numbers and strings), Python will raise a `TypeError`. The annotations do not mention this potential issue, so it's an important edge case to consider.
   - **Nested Lists**: The function does not handle nested lists beyond the first level. If a sublist contains another list, that inner list will be treated as a single element during sorting.
   - **Null or None Input**: The function does not explicitly handle `None` or null inputs. If `list_of_lists` is `None`, a `TypeError` will be raised when trying to iterate over it.
   - **Input Validation**: The function assumes that the input will always be a list of lists where each sublist contains strings. It does not perform any validation to ensure this structure is maintained.

Given these considerations, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists of strings, sorts each sublist in ascending order, and returns the sorted list of lists. It assumes the input structure is correct and does not handle invalid or nested structures beyond the first level, potentially raising errors for non-comparable elements, null inputs, or if the input is not a list of lists. **
