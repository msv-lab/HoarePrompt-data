The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `real` and `imag`, both of which are real numbers. After executing the function body, it returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number formed by `real` and `imag`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, and return the phase of this complex number.

Functionality: **The function accepts two real number parameters, `real` and `imag`, and returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number formed by `real` and `imag`.**
