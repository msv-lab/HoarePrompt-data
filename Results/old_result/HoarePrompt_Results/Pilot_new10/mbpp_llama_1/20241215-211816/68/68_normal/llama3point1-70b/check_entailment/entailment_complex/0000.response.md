**Correctness: True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The problem description asks for a function to get the angle of a complex number.
2. The provided function, `func_1`, takes two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, as input, creates a complex number from them using the `complex` function, and returns its phase (angle) in radians using the `cmath.phase` function.
3. The function properly handles all possible cases, including those where `real` is 0, because `cmath.phase` is designed to handle such cases and return the correct angle.
4. The returned angle is in radians, which is a common and suitable unit for representing angles in mathematics and programming.

The `cmath.phase` function is able to handle the case where `real` is 0 because it doesn't simply calculate the arctangent of `imag/real`, but instead uses a more robust algorithm that can handle this and other edge cases correctly.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and should work correctly for all potential inputs.
