Based on the problem description, the program is supposed to write a function to get the angle of a complex number. The original assessment is "None", which implies that no initial assessment was made.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two real numbers `real` and `imag` as input, creates a complex number from them, and returns its phase (angle) in radians using the `cmath.phase` function.

The annotated version of the code explains the state of the program at different points and describes what the function does. It states that the function properly handles all possible cases, including those where `real` is 0.

However, the annotated version does not explicitly mention how the function handles the case where `real` is 0 and `imag` is also 0. In this case, the phase of the complex number is undefined in mathematics. The `cmath.phase` function in Python returns 0 in this case, but this is an arbitrary choice and may not be what the user expects.

Despite this, for most practical purposes and assuming the user will always provide a valid input (i.e., a non-zero complex number), the function seems to be correct.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, and the annotations, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
