#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are real numbers.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `complex_num` in radians, which is equal to the arctangent of `imag/real`, where `real` and `imag` are real numbers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two real numbers, `real` and `imag`, creates a complex number from them, and returns its phase (angle) in radians, properly handling all possible cases, including those where `real` is 0.
