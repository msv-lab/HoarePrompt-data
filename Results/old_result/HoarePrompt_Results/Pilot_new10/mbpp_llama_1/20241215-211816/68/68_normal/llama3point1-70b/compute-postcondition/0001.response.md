The `cmath.phase()` function returns the phase (angle) of a complex number. Given that `complex_num` is a complex number equal to `real + imag*1j`, the phase of `complex_num` will be the arctangent of `imag/real`. 

However, the actual value returned by `cmath.phase()` will be in radians, and it will be in the range (-pi, pi]. 

So, `cmath.phase(complex_num)` will return the phase (angle) of the complex number `complex_num`, which has real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`.

Output State: **The program returns the phase (angle) of the complex number `complex_num` in radians, which is equal to the arctangent of `imag/real`, where `real` and `imag` are real numbers**
