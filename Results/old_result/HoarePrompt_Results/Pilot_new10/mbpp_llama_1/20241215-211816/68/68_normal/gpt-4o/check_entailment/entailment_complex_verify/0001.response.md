The original assessment is "None", which means there is no evaluation of the program's correctness. Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` is designed to calculate the angle of a complex number, which is achieved by using the `cmath.phase` function.

The annotated version of the code explains the state of the program before the function call and the return value of the function. It indicates that the function correctly forms a complex number from the input real and imaginary parts and returns the phase (angle in radians) of this complex number.

After reviewing the code and the annotations, it appears that the function is correctly implemented according to the problem description. The `cmath.phase` function is a built-in Python function that returns the phase (angle in radians) of a complex number, which aligns with the problem's requirement.

The provided unit tests also suggest that the function behaves as expected for different inputs.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the code, and the annotations, I believe the program is correct.

Final: **True**
