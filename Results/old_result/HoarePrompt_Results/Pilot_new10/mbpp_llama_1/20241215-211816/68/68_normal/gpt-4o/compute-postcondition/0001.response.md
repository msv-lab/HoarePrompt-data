The `cmath.phase()` function returns the phase (angle) of a complex number. Given the initial state where `complex_number` is a complex number equal to `real + imag`j, the phase of this complex number can be calculated using the formula `atan2(imag, real)`, which is essentially what `cmath.phase()` does.

Therefore, the program returns the phase of the complex number `complex_number`, which is a value ranging from `-pi` to `pi` (exclusive) representing the angle in radians from the positive real axis to the point represented by `complex_number` in the complex plane.

Output State: **The program returns the phase (angle in radians) of the complex number `real + imag`j**
