The code creates a complex number `complex_num` using the `complex` function, which takes two arguments: the real part and the imaginary part. In this case, the real part is the value of `real` and the imaginary part is the value of `imag`. 

So, `complex_num` is assigned the value of a complex number with `real` as its real part and `imag` as its imaginary part.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `real` is a real number, `imag` is a real number, `complex_num` is a complex number equal to `real + imag*1j`.

Output State: **`real` is a real number, `imag` is a real number, `complex_num` is a complex number equal to `real + imag*1j`**
