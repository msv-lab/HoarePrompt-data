The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The provided function `func_1(s)` uses the built-in `count()` method in Python, which correctly counts the number of occurrences of the specified string (`'std'` in this case) in the given string `s`. The annotated version of the code also confirms that the program returns the correct count of the string 'std' in the input string `s`. 

Given that the input to the program will always be a valid string, the function works as expected according to the problem description. There are no edge cases that would cause the `count()` method to fail, and the function simply returns the result of this method. 

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
