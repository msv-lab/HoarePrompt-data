You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to count the number of occurence of the string 'std' in a given string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    return s.count('std')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in `s`. This is achieved using the built-in `count` method of Python strings, which returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the specified string.

The program works correctly for every potential case because the `count` method correctly handles:

1. Empty strings: If the input string is empty, `count` will return 0, which is the correct number of occurrences of 'std'.
2. No occurrences: If the string 'std' does not appear in the input string, `count` will return 0.
3. Single occurrence: If the string 'std' appears once in the input string, `count` will return 1.
4. Multiple occurrences: If the string 'std' appears multiple times in the input string, `count` will return the correct count.
5. Overlapping occurrences: Although the `count` method does not count overlapping occurrences, this is actually the desired behavior for counting the occurrences of a substring in a string.

Since the `count` method handles all these cases correctly, the program is correct. There are no potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string `s` and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in `s`, throwing an error if `s` is not a string.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
