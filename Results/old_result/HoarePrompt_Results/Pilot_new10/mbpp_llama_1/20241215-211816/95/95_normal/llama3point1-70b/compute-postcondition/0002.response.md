The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s`. According to the code, it returns the number of occurrences of the string 'std' in `s`. 

Looking at the code, it directly uses the `count` method of the string class in Python, which counts the number of occurrences of its argument in the string. This method is case-sensitive and considers 'std', 'Std', 'STD', etc., as different strings. 

There are no conditional statements or loops in the function, so it does not handle any potential edge cases differently than the standard behavior of the `count` method. 

The function does not check if the input is indeed a string or if it can be converted into one. If a non-string input is provided, the function will throw an error because the `count` method is not defined for all types of objects in Python.

Therefore, considering the actual code as the truth, the functionality of the function is to count the occurrences of 'std' in a given string and return this count, with the assumption that the input is a string.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and returns the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in `s`, throwing an error if `s` is not a string. **
