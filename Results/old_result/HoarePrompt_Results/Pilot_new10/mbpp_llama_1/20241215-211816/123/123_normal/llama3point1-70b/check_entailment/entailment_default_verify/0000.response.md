The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, we can assess the correctness of the program.

The problem description requires a function that splits a given list into two parts, where the length of the first part is a specified non-negative integer L. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` and returns a tuple of two lists. 

The output hints describe the expected behavior of the function, including cases where L is greater than or equal to the length of the list, L is 0, and the list is empty. The code `return (lst[:L], lst[L:])` accurately implements this behavior. 

For example, if `L` is greater than or equal to the length of `lst`, `lst[:L]` will return all elements of `lst`, and `lst[L:]` will return an empty list, as described in the output hints. Similarly, if `L` is 0, `lst[:L]` will return an empty list, and `lst[L:]` will return all elements of `lst`. If `lst` is empty, both `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]` will return empty lists.

Since the provided code matches the expected behavior described in the problem description and the output hints, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
