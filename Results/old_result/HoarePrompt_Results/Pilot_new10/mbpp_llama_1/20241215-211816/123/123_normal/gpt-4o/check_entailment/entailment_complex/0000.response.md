Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires the function to take in a list and an integer L, split the list into two parts where the length of the first part is L, and return the resulting lists in a tuple.

The program achieves this by using Python's list slicing feature. The `return lst[:L], lst[L:]` statement splits the list `lst` into two parts at index `L`. The `lst[:L]` slice returns a list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the `lst[L:]` slice returns a list containing the remaining elements of `lst`.

For all possible values of `L` (where `0 <= L <= len(lst)`), the program correctly splits the list into two parts and returns the resulting lists in a tuple.

Here are some examples to illustrate this:

* If `L = 0`, the program returns an empty list and the original list, which is correct because the length of the first part is 0.
* If `L = len(lst)`, the program returns the original list and an empty list, which is correct because the length of the first part is equal to the length of the original list.
* For any `L` where `0 < L < len(lst)`, the program returns two non-empty lists, where the length of the first list is `L` and the second list contains the remaining elements.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the program behaves correctly for different inputs and values of `L`.

Therefore, the program is correct because it meets the problem description for every potential case, and it does so by using a simple and efficient list slicing approach.
