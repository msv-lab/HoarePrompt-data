Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the function as described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and returns a tuple of two lists, where the first list contains the first `L` elements of `lst` and the second list contains the remaining elements.

The function uses Python's list slicing feature to split the input list into two parts. The expression `lst[:L]` generates a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the expression `lst[L:]` generates a new list containing all elements of `lst` starting from the `L`-th index.

This implementation works correctly for all possible cases, including:

* When `L` is equal to the length of `lst`, the function returns a tuple containing the original list and an empty list.
* When `L` is greater than the length of `lst`, the function returns a tuple containing the original list and an empty list, because `lst[L:]` will be an empty list.
* When `L` is less than zero, the function will also work correctly, but it will effectively return the original list and an empty list, because `lst[:L]` will be an empty list.
* When the input list is empty, the function will return a tuple containing two empty lists, which is the expected behavior.

Overall, the program is correct and implements the function as described in the problem statement.
