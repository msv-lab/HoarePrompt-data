The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and returns a tuple of two lists where the first list contains the first `L` elements of `lst` and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`; if `L` is greater than or equal to the length of `lst`, the first list contains all elements of `lst` and the second list is empty; if `L` is 0, the first list is empty and the second list contains all elements of `lst`; if `lst` is empty, both lists in the tuple are empty.
