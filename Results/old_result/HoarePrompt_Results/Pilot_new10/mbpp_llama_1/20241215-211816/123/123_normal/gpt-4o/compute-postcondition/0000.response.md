To understand the impact of the code on the program, let's break down the given information and the code itself.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `lst` is a list.
   - `L` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`.
   
2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code `return lst[:L], lst[L:]` is splitting the list `lst` into two parts at the index `L`.
   - `lst[:L]` returns a slice of the list from the start up to, but not including, the element at index `L`.
   - `lst[L:]` returns a slice of the list from the element at index `L` to the end of the list.

Given that `L` can be any non-negative integer up to the length of `lst`, the slices returned can vary as follows:
- If `L = 0`, `lst[:L]` will be an empty list `[]`, and `lst[L:]` will be the entire list `lst`.
- If `L = len(lst)`, `lst[:L]` will be the entire list `lst`, and `lst[L:]` will be an empty list `[]`.
- For any `L` where `0 < L < len(lst)`, the list will be split into two non-empty parts at index `L`.

**Output State**: **The program returns two lists: the first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second list contains elements from index `L` to the end of `lst`.**
