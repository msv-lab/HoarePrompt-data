Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input, and returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list contains the first `L` elements of `lst`, and the second list contains the remaining elements of `lst`.

The code `return lst[:L], lst[L:]` is a Pythonic way to split a list into two parts. The syntax `lst[:L]` returns a slice of the list from the start up to, but not including, the element at index `L`. The syntax `lst[L:]` returns a slice of the list from the element at index `L` to the end of the list.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If `L = 0`, `lst[:L]` returns an empty list `[]`, and `lst[L:]` returns the entire list `lst`.
* If `L = len(lst)`, `lst[:L]` returns the entire list `lst`, and `lst[L:]` returns an empty list `[]`.
* For any `L` where `0 < L < len(lst)`, the list is split into two non-empty parts at index `L`.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate that the program works correctly for different inputs.

Overall, the program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all possible cases correctly.
