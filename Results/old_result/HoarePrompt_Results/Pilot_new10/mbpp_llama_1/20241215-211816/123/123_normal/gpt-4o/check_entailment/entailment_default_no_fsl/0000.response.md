Correctness: **True**

I believe the code is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an integer `L` and returns a tuple of two lists, where the first list contains the first `L` elements of `lst` and the second list contains the remaining elements.

The code uses list slicing (`lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]`) to achieve this, which is a standard and efficient way to split lists in Python. The list slicing operation works correctly regardless of the type of elements in the list, the length of the list, or the value of `L`, as long as `L` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to the length of the list.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for different types of input lists and values of `L`. The output hints also agree with the code, indicating that the function splits the input list into two parts at the specified index and returns these two parts.

Overall, I did not find any cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, and all the examples provided work correctly, which leads me to conclude that the correctness of the program is **True**.
