Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and returns a tuple containing two lists. The first list in the tuple contains the first `L` elements of the input list, and the second list contains the remaining elements.

The function uses Python's list slicing feature to achieve this. `lst[:L]` returns a new list containing the first `L` elements of `lst`, and `lst[L:]` returns a new list containing the elements of `lst` starting from the `L`-th index to the end.

This implementation correctly handles all potential cases, including:

* When `L` is equal to the length of the input list, in which case the second list in the tuple is empty.
* When `L` is greater than the length of the input list, in which case the first list in the tuple is equal to the input list and the second list is empty.
* When `L` is 0, in which case the first list in the tuple is empty and the second list is equal to the input list.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function.

Overall, the function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
