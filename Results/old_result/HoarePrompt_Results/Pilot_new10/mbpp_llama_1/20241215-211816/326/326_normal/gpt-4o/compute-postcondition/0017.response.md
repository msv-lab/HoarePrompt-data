Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least three elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `3 <= n <= len(arr)`, `i` is 2, and `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`. If `diff` is less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `arr[3] - arr[2]`. Otherwise, no update occurs.***
