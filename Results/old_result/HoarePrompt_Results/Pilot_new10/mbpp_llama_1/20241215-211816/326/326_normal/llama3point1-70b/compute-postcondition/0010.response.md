Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 1. If `diff` (which is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`) is less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `diff`. In any case, `diff` remains as `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`.***
