Based on the provided code and the problem description, the original assessment is "None", indicating that there was no initial assessment of the program's correctness.

The annotated version of the code provides a step-by-step explanation of the program's execution and reveals that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the given array.

The function first checks if the input size `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0. If `n` is 2 or more, it sorts the array and then iterates through the sorted array to find the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements.

The annotated code confirms that the function behaves as expected. The state of the program after the `if` block and the `for` loop is accurately described, and the final returned value is indeed the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sublist `arr[0:n]`.

Given the problem description and the annotated code, it appears that the program is correct. The function correctly calculates the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the given array.

Final: **True**
