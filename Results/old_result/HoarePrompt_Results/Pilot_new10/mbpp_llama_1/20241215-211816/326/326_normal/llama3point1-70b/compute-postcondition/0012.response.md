The value of `diff` is assigned the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`. Given `i` is 2, `diff` is `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `arr[2]` is less than or equal to `arr[3]`, making `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])` equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 4 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 2, `diff` is `arr[3] - arr[2]`.**
