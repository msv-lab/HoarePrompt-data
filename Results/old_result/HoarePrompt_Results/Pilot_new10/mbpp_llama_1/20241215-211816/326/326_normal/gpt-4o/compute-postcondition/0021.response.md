The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `n` as parameters. 

The function first checks if `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0. 

If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, it sorts the list `arr` in ascending order and then iterates over the first `n-1` elements to find the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements.

The functionality of the function can be summarized as follows: 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns 0 if `n` is less than 2; otherwise, it returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted sublist `arr[0:n]`, which is a non-negative integer. Note that if `n` is greater than the length of `arr`, the function will still work correctly but `n` will be capped at the length of `arr` because the loop only iterates up to `n-1` and the array is sorted, thus the minimum difference will be calculated based on the entire array if `n` is greater than the array length. **
