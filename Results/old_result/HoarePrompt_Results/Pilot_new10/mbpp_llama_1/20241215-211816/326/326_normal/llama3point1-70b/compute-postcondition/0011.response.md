To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we'll analyze the given information and the loop statement. The loop statement is `for i in range(len(arr) - 1):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `len(arr) - 1`.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements.
- `target` is an integer (its value or relevance to the loop condition isn't specified).
- `i` is 1.
- `diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, and if `diff` is less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `diff`.

Since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to increment by 1, making `i` equal to 2. The loop condition `i < len(arr) - 1` must still be true for the loop to continue. Given that `arr` must have at least 3 elements and `i` is currently 1 (about to become 2), `arr` must have at least 4 elements for `i` to be less than `len(arr) - 1` when `i` is 2.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:
- `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 4 elements.
- `target` remains an integer, but its value or specifics aren't altered by the loop condition directly.
- `i` is 2.
- The conditions related to `diff` and `min_diff` depend on the operations within the loop body, which aren't specified. However, the key point for loop continuation is the value of `i` and the length of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 4 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 2**
