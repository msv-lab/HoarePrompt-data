To determine the output state, we need to consider the initial state and the given Python code snippet. The initial state provides that `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `target` is an integer, and `min_diff` is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr` if `arr` has at least 2 elements, otherwise `min_diff` is positive infinity.

Given the code `return min_diff`, we are returning the value of `min_diff`. 

Since `min_diff` is defined as the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr` if `arr` has at least 2 elements, otherwise it is positive infinity, the returned value will be the smallest difference found between consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`, or positive infinity if `arr` has less than 2 elements.

Output State: **The program returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr` if `arr` has at least 2 elements, otherwise it returns positive infinity**
