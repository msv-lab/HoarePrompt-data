    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in `arr` if `arr` has at least 2 elements, otherwise `min_diff` is positive infinity.
    return min_diff
    #The program returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr` if `arr` has at least 2 elements, otherwise it returns positive infinity
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an unused integer `target`, sorts `arr` in ascending order, and returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list. If `arr` has less than 2 elements, it returns positive infinity.
