The code updates the value of `min_diff` to be equal to `diff`. Since `diff` is the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr` and is less than the current value of `min_diff`, `min_diff` will be updated to this new value.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `diff` (the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`), `i` is 0, `diff` is the absolute difference between the first two elements of `arr`**
