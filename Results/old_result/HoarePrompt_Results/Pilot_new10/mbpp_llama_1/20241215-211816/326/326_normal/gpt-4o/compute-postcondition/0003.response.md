The given code sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `arr` is a list of integers and `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`, and `arr` has at least two elements, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

After the execution of the code, the list `arr` is sorted in ascending order. The value of `n` remains unchanged as the code does not modify it. Therefore, `n` is still a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`, `arr` has at least two elements, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`, `arr` has at least two elements, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2**
