To calculate the new value of `diff`, we first need to understand what `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]` are. Given that `i` is 1 and `arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `arr[i]` refers to the second element of `arr` (since indexing starts at 0), and `arr[i + 1]` refers to the third element of `arr`.

The initial `diff` was the absolute difference between the second and third elements of `arr`. Now, `diff` is updated to be the absolute difference between the second and third elements of `arr`, which can be expressed as `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])` since `i` is 1.

Given that `arr` is sorted in ascending order, the difference between any two consecutive elements is determined by the values of those elements. The new `diff` will be the absolute difference between the second element (`arr[1]`) and the third element (`arr[2]`) of `arr`.

Since the values of `arr[1]` and `arr[2]` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `diff`, but we can say it is the absolute difference between these two elements.

The states of the other variables (`arr`, `target`, `i`, and `min_diff`) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `i` is 1, `diff` is `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, and `min_diff` remains as it was since its update depends on a comparison not shown in the given code snippet.**
