To determine the functionality of the function, let's analyze the provided code and annotations step by step:

1. **Function Parameters and Return Value**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` (a list of integers) and `target` (an integer). However, upon examining the code, it becomes apparent that `target` is not utilized within the function. The function returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `arr`.

2. **Sorting of Array**: The function sorts the input list `arr` in ascending order. This is a crucial step as it ensures that the differences calculated are between consecutive elements in a sorted sequence.

3. **Calculation of Minimum Difference**: The function then iterates through the sorted list, calculating the absolute difference between each pair of consecutive elements. It keeps track of the minimum difference found during these calculations.

4. **Edge Case - List with Less Than 2 Elements**: If the list `arr` contains less than 2 elements, the function will not enter the loop that calculates differences. In such cases, `min_diff` will remain as its initial value, `float('inf')`, indicating positive infinity. This is because there are not enough elements to calculate a difference.

5. **Unused Parameter `target`**: Despite `target` being passed as a parameter, it is not used anywhere within the function. This might be an oversight or a remnant of a previous version of the function where `target` played a role.

6. **Return Postconditions**: The function returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list if the list has at least 2 elements. Otherwise, it returns positive infinity.

Given the analysis, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an unused integer `target`, sorts `arr` in ascending order, and returns the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list. If `arr` has less than 2 elements, it returns positive infinity. **
