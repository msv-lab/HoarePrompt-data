The code `min_diff = float('inf')` initializes a variable `min_diff` to positive infinity. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`arr` is still a sorted list of integers in ascending order, 
`n` is still a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`, 
`arr` still has at least two elements, and 
`n` is still greater than or equal to 2.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, 
`n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`, 
`arr` has at least two elements, 
`n` is greater than or equal to 2, 
and `min_diff` is positive infinity.
Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`, `arr` has at least two elements, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `min_diff` is positive infinity**
