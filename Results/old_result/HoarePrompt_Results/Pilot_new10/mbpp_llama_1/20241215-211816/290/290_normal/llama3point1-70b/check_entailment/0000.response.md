Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(s)` is designed to check if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. Here is a breakdown of how it works:

1. It splits the input string `s` into words using the `split()` method.
2. It then iterates over each word in the list of words.
3. For each word, it checks if the length of the word is greater than 1 and if 'z' is present in the word, excluding the first and last characters (`word[1:-1]`).
4. If it finds a word that meets these conditions, it immediately returns `True`.
5. If it checks all words and does not find any that meet the conditions, it returns `False`.

This function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Single-word strings with 'z' at the start or end.
- Single-word strings with 'z' in the middle.
- Multi-word strings with 'z' in one or more words.
- Strings with no 'z' characters at all.
- Strings with only one word and 'z' as the only character.

I couldn't find a potential case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description, so I conclude that the function is correct.
