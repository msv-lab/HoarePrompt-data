You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(s)` is designed to check if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word. Here is a breakdown of how it works:

1. It splits the input string `s` into words using the `split()` method.
2. It then iterates over each word in the list of words.
3. For each word, it checks if the length of the word is greater than 1 and if 'z' is present in the word, excluding the first and last characters (`word[1:-1]`).
4. If it finds a word that meets these conditions, it immediately returns `True`.
5. If it checks all words and does not find any that meet the conditions, it returns `False`.

This function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Single-word strings with 'z' at the start or end.
- Single-word strings with 'z' in the middle.
- Multi-word strings with 'z' in one or more words.
- Strings with no 'z' characters at all.
- Strings with only one word and 'z' as the only character.

I couldn't find a potential case where the function does not work as expected according to the problem description, so I conclude that the function is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a string `s`, splits it into words, and checks each word for the presence of 'z' in its middle characters (excluding the first and last characters), returning `True` if such a word is found and `False` otherwise, including cases where the input string is empty or contains no words with 'z' in their middle characters

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
