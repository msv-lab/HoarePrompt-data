The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s` and checks if the character 'z' is present in the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters. 

If 'z' is found in this substring, the function returns `True`. 

If 'z' is not found in the substring, the function returns `False`. 

It's also important to note that this function does not handle any potential edge cases such as an empty string or a string with less than 3 characters, in which case `s[1:-1]` would result in an empty string or an index error for strings with length 1. However, since the function does not explicitly handle these cases, it will still return `False` for empty strings or strings with less than 3 characters because 'z' cannot be found in an empty string or a string with only one or two characters when excluding the first and last characters.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if 'z' is found in the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters, and `False` otherwise, including for empty strings or strings with less than 3 characters. **
