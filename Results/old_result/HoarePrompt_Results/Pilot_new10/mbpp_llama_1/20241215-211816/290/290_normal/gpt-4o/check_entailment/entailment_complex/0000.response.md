To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to analyze whether it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem statement asks for a function that checks if a string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.

The provided function `func_1` operates as follows:
1. It checks if 'z' is present in the substring of `s` excluding the first and last characters (`s[1:-1]`).
2. If 'z' is found in this substring, it returns `True`.
3. If 'z' is not found in the substring (or if the string is shorter than 3 characters, making `s[1:-1]` empty or non-existent), it returns `False`.

Given the problem description and the implementation details:
- The function correctly checks for the presence of 'z' in the substring excluding the first and last characters of the input string `s`.
- It correctly handles the start and end positions by excluding them from the check through slicing (`s[1:-1]`).
- For empty strings or strings with less than 3 characters, the slicing operation will result in an empty string or will not produce an error, but due to the nature of slicing, attempting to access `s[1:-1]` on such strings will indeed result in an empty string, correctly leading to a `False` return value because 'z' cannot be in an empty string.

The function meets all the requirements specified in the problem description:
- It checks for the presence of 'z' in the string, excluding the start and end.
- It correctly handles edge cases such as empty strings or very short strings.

Therefore, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
