The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. `lst` is a list and `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of 'n' sublists. Each sublist is a slice of the original list `lst` with a step size of `n`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of 'n' sublists, where each sublist is a slice of `lst` with a step size of `n`.**
