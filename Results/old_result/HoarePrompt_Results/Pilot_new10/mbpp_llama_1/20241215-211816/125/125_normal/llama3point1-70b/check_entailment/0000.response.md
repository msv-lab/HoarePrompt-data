Correctness: **True**.

The given program, `func_1(lst, n)`, uses list comprehension to create a new list of lists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list, starting from each of the first n indices. This effectively splits the list into n sublists, each containing every nth element.

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `n = 3`, the function will return `[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`.

Upon reviewing the code, I couldn't find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The list comprehension approach ensures that every nth element is correctly grouped into separate sublists, regardless of the input list size or the value of n. 

The code handles cases when the list size is a multiple of n, as well as cases when it is not. It also handles edge cases, such as when n is 1 (in which case the function returns the original list as a single sublist) or when n is greater than the list size (in which case the function returns a list of sublists, each containing a single element from the original list).

Overall, the program appears to be correct and should work as expected for all possible inputs.
