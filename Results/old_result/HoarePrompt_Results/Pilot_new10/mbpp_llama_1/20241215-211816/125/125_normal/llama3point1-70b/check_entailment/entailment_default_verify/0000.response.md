Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, we need to assess the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks to split a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists. The provided code implements this using list slicing with a specified step size.

The output hints suggest that the function accepts a list and a positive integer and returns a list of sublists where each sublist is a slice of the original list with a specified step size. This aligns with the problem description.

However, the output hints also mention that the function may not handle non-integer or non-positive step sizes correctly. The original assessment does not mention this, and the code does not explicitly handle these cases. But, since we assume the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we can disregard this potential issue.

The code provided, `def func_1(lst, n): return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]`, effectively splits the input list `lst` into sublists where each sublist is a slice of the original list with a step size of `n`. This meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Given the information available, there is no clear indication that the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description, assuming valid inputs.

Final: **True**
