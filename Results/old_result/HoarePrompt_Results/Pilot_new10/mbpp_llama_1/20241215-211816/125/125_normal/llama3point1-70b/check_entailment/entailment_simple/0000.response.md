Correctness: **True**

The given Python program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes in two parameters: `lst` (a list) and `n` (a positive integer).
2. The function uses list comprehension to create a new list of sublists.
3. The expression `lst[i::n]` generates slices of the original list `lst` with a step size of `n`, starting from index `i`. This effectively splits the list at every `n`-th element.
4. The outer list comprehension `for i in range(n)` iterates over the range of `n`, creating `n` sublists.
5. The resulting list of sublists is returned by the function.

For example, if `lst = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9]` and `n = 3`, the function will return:

`[[1, 4, 7], [2, 5, 8], [3, 6, 9]]`

which is the correct result of splitting the list at every 3rd element.

The program works correctly for any list `lst` and any positive integer `n`, meeting the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
