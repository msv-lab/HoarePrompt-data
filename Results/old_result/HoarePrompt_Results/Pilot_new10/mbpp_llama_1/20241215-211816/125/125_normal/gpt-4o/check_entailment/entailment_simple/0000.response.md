Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it splits the list in a round-robin manner instead of splitting the list for every nth element.

For example, if we have a list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 2`, the program will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 6]]` instead of `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]]`.

The problem description asks to split the list for every nth element, which means that the list should be divided into chunks of size n. The program, however, distributes the elements of the list in a round-robin manner, which is a different operation.

To meet the problem description, the program should be modified to use list slicing or a loop that appends elements to a new list until it reaches the nth element, then starts a new list.

Here's a corrected version of the function:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [lst[i:i+n] for i in range(0, len(lst), n)]
    return result
```
This function uses list comprehension to create a new list of lists, where each inner list is a chunk of the original list of size n.
