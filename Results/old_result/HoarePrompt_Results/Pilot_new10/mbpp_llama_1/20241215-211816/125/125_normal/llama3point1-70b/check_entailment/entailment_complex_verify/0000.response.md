To determine the final correctness of the program, we need to analyze the problem description, the original assessment, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description asks for a function that takes a list and an integer n and splits the list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.

The original assessment is None, indicating that there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness.

The provided code is:
```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
```
This code uses list comprehension to create a list of sublists, where each sublist is a slice of the original list with a step size of n.

The annotated code explains the state of the program at different points and provides additional context about the function's behavior.

Based on the annotated code, it appears that the function is designed to split the list into sublists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list, starting from the corresponding index.

The key insight here is that the function uses a step size of n to slice the list, which effectively splits the list into sublists of elements that are n positions apart.

Considering the problem description and the annotated code, it seems that the program is correct. The function takes a list and an integer n as input and returns a list of sublists, where each sublist contains every nth element from the original list.

The original assessment being None does not provide any information to contradict or support the correctness of the program. However, based on the analysis of the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated code, it appears that the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
