#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and n is a positive integer.
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of 'n' sublists, where each sublist is a slice of 'lst' with a step size of 'n', 'n' is a positive integer, and 'lst' is the original list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list and a positive integer, and returns a list of sublists where each sublist is a slice of the original list with a specified step size, potentially returning empty sublists if the list is empty or the step size exceeds the list length, and may not handle non-integer or non-positive step sizes correctly
