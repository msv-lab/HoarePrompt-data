Based on the provided problem description, code, and annotations, the original assessment was "None", indicating that there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness.

After examining the code and annotations, it's clear that the function `func_1` accurately converts degrees to radians using the formula `degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. The assertions provided also confirm the correctness of the function for specific input values.

The annotated version of the code provides a clear explanation of the function's behavior and state at different points, which aligns with the expected behavior of a degree-to-radian conversion function.

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment was not accurate in the sense that it did not provide any evaluation, but the program itself is correct based on the problem description and annotations.

Final: **True**
