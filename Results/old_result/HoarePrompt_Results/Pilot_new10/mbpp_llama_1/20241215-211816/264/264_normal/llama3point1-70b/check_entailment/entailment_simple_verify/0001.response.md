To assess the correctness of the program, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that converts degrees to radians. The formula for converting degrees to radians is \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \).

2. **Original Program**:
   ```python
import math

def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
```
   This program directly implements the formula for converting degrees to radians. It imports the `math` module to access the constant `math.pi`, which is then used in the conversion formula.

3. **Original Assessment**: None. There's no initial assessment provided to evaluate or compare against.

4. **Annotated Version of the Program**:
   ```python
import math

# State of the program right before the function call: deg is a real number.
def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
    # The program returns the radians equivalent of the input degree, which is a real number.
```
   The annotations indicate that the function expects a real number as input (`deg`) and that it returns the radian equivalent of this input, which is also a real number. This aligns perfectly with the formula for converting degrees to radians.

Given the above analysis:

- The program directly implements the mathematical formula for converting degrees to radians, which matches the problem description.
- The annotated version confirms that the program expects and returns real numbers, which is consistent with the task of converting degrees to radians and the nature of the formula used.
- Since there was no original assessment provided to contradict or compare against, and given that the provided program correctly implements the required conversion, we can conclude that the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations.

**Final: True**
