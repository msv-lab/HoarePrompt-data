To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state is that `deg` is a real number. The code provided is `return deg * math.pi / 180`.

Given that `deg` is a real number, the operation `deg * math.pi / 180` converts degrees to radians, where `math.pi` is a constant representing the mathematical constant pi (approximately 3.14159) and `180` is the number of degrees in a pi radian.

Therefore, the result of `deg * math.pi / 180` will also be a real number, representing the angle in radians equivalent to `deg` degrees.

Output State: **The program returns the radians equivalent of the input degree, which is a real number.**
