To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the provided code.

The problem description requires writing a function to convert degrees to radians. The formula to convert degrees to radians is well-known and involves multiplying the angle in degrees by π/180.

The provided function, `func_1`, takes an input `degrees` and returns the result of `degrees * (math.pi / 180)`. This directly implements the conversion formula from degrees to radians, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Correct Formula**: The function uses the correct mathematical formula for converting degrees to radians, which is `radians = degrees * (π / 180)`. In the code, `math.pi` is used for π, which is a precise representation of pi in Python's math library.

2. **Appropriate Input Handling**: The function accepts a single argument, `degrees`, which is expected to be a real number representing the angle in degrees. The function does not explicitly check if the input is a real number, but the assertion tests included suggest that it works correctly with real number inputs, which meets the implicit expectation for such a conversion function.

3. **Correct Output**: The function returns the result of the conversion, which is also a real number representing the angle in radians. This aligns with the problem description's requirement to convert degrees to radians.

4. **Assertion Tests**: The provided assertion tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for specific inputs (90, 60, and 120 degrees), which cover typical cases and provide evidence that the function behaves as expected for different degrees inputs.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the degree-to-radian conversion function as specified in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
