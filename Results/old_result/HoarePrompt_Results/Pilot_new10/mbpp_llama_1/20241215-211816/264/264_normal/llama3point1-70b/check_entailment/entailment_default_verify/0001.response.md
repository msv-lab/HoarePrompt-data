Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, we can determine the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks for a function to convert degrees to radians. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a degree value as input, applies the conversion formula `deg * math.pi / 180`, and returns the result in radians. The output hints confirm that this is the intended functionality of the function.

Given that the code correctly implements the conversion formula and the output hints match the expected behavior, the original assessment of "None" can be considered as lacking in information but not necessarily incorrect, since it doesn't provide a clear judgment of the code's correctness.

However, considering the program's functionality, the code provided does indeed perform the task described in the problem statement. It correctly converts degrees to radians without any apparent errors in the conversion process itself.

The output hints emphasize that the function assumes the input is a numeric value and lacks error handling for non-numeric inputs. However, the problem statement and the task do not explicitly require input validation or error handling for non-numeric inputs, assuming the input will always be valid as per the given conditions.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the strict format for input and output, we can conclude that the program is correct as it accurately fulfills the problem's requirements within the assumptions given.

Final: **True**
