Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(deg)` appears to be a correct implementation of the mathematical formula to convert degrees to radians. The formula `radians = degrees * math.pi / 180` is a standard conversion formula used in mathematics and physics.

The function takes an input `deg` which is expected to be the angle in degrees, and returns the equivalent angle in radians. This conversion is correct for all real numbers, including positive and negative angles, as well as zero.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function handles all possible inputs correctly, and the output is always the correct conversion of the input angle from degrees to radians.

For example, if we call `func_1(90)`, the output will be `math.pi / 2`, which is the correct conversion of 90 degrees to radians. Similarly, if we call `func_1(-45)`, the output will be `-math.pi / 4`, which is the correct conversion of -45 degrees to radians.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and works as expected for all possible inputs, so I conclude that the Correctness is **True**.
