The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `degrees`, which is a real number, and returns its radian equivalent as a real number. The conversion is performed by multiplying the input `degrees` by the ratio of `math.pi` to 180.

Upon examining the code, it appears that the function does not handle any potential errors that may occur during the conversion process. However, since the conversion is a simple multiplication operation, it is unlikely to encounter any errors unless the input is not a number or is very large. 

Additionally, the function does not check if the input `degrees` is within a valid range. The radian equivalent of an angle is usually defined within the range of -π to π, but the function does not perform any checks to ensure that the input `degrees` falls within this range. It simply performs the conversion and returns the result.

Another edge case to consider is when the input `degrees` is a very large number. In this case, the function may return a result that is outside of the valid range for floating-point numbers in Python, potentially leading to an overflow error.

However, the given code does not explicitly handle any of these edge cases. It simply performs the conversion and returns the result.
