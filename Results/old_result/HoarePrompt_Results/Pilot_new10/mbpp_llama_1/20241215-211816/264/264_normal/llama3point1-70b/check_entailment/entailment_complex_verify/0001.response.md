To assess the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, let's analyze the information provided:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that converts degrees to radians. The formula for this conversion is \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \).

2. **Original Program**:
   ```python
import math

def func_1(deg):
    return deg * math.pi / 180
```

3. **Original Assessment**: None. This means there's no initial judgment on the program's correctness.

4. **Annotated Version**:
   The annotated version explains that the function takes a real number representing degrees, applies the conversion formula, and returns the result in radians. It also notes the assumption that the input will be a numeric value and mentions the lack of error handling for non-numeric inputs.

Given the problem description and the annotated version of the code, we can see that the program accurately implements the formula for converting degrees to radians. The annotated version correctly describes the program's behavior, assuming valid numeric input.

The original assessment was "None," indicating no prior judgment. However, based on the provided code and its annotated version, it's clear that the program correctly performs the task of converting degrees to radians for valid inputs.

The only potential issue mentioned in the annotated version is the lack of error handling for non-numeric inputs. However, the problem statement and the instructions for this task specify that we should assume the input will always be valid, thus this does not affect the program's correctness under the given assumptions.

Therefore, considering the problem description, the provided code, and the assumptions made about valid input, the program is correct.

Final: **True**
