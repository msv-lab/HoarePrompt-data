The original assessment is None, which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. The problem description asks for a function to convert degrees to radians, and the provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a real number `degrees` and returns its radian equivalent by multiplying it with `math.pi / 180`.

The output hints confirm that the function works as intended, multiplying the input `degrees` by `math.pi / 180` to convert it to radians. The output hints also mention that the function does not perform any input validation or error checking, which is acceptable given the assumption that the input will always be valid.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, it appears that the program is correct. The function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians using the standard conversion factor `math.pi / 180`.

The reason why I think the original assessment is not applicable in this case is that it is None, and therefore does not provide any information to contradict or support. However, based on the available information, I have made an independent assessment of the program's correctness.

The reason why I think the program is correct is that it correctly implements the conversion formula from degrees to radians, and the output hints confirm that it produces the expected results for the given input values.

Final: **True**
