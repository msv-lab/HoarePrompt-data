The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns `list1` with its last element replaced by all elements of `list2` if `list1` is not empty; if `list1` is empty, it does not modify `list1` and returns the original `list1` because the modification inside the function does not affect the original list due to scope limitations.
