To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet: `return list1[:-1] + list2`. 

Given that `list1` and `list2` are lists, and `list1` is not empty, we can deduce the following:

- `list1[:-1]` means all elements in `list1` except the last one.
- `list2` can be any list.

The code returns the concatenation of `list1` (excluding its last element) and `list2`.

Output State: **The program returns a list that is the concatenation of all elements in `list1` except the last one and all elements in `list2`**
