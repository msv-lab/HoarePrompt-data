To analyze the provided function `func_1`, let's break it down step by step:

1. **Parameters**: The function accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are expected to be lists. The annotations specify that `list1` is not empty.

2. **Functionality**: The function returns a new list that is the concatenation of all elements in `list1` except the last one (`list1[:-1]`) and all elements in `list2`.

3. **Return Postconditions**: The overall postcondition is that the function returns a list that is the concatenation of all elements in `list1` (except the last one) and all elements in `list2`.

4. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
    - The annotations and the return postconditions do not explicitly address what happens if `list2` is empty. However, the code will still work correctly in this case, returning all elements of `list1` except the last one, since concatenating with an empty list does not change the original list.
    - If `list1` has only one element, `list1[:-1]` will return an empty list, and the function will return a copy of `list2`.
    - The annotations specify that `list1` is not empty, but the code does not explicitly check for this condition. If `list1` is empty, `list1[:-1]` will return an empty list, and the function will simply return a copy of `list2`. This behavior is consistent with the code's logic, even though it technically violates the condition stated in the annotations.

Given the code and the annotations, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list that concatenates all elements in `list1` except the last one with all elements in `list2`. If `list1` is empty, it returns a copy of `list2`. If `list2` is empty, it returns all elements of `list1` except the last one. **
