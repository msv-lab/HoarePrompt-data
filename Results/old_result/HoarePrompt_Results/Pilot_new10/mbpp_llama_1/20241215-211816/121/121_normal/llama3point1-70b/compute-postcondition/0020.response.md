Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is 8, the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument returns an unknown value, if `num` % 6 is in [1, 5] and `count` equals `n`, then the program returns `num` which is 8. In all cases, `count` is initially 1 and `n` is not equal to 1, so if `n` is 2, then `count` equals `n`, otherwise `count` is not equal to `n`.***
