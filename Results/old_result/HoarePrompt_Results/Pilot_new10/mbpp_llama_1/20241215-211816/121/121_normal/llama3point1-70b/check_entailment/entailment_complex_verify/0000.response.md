Based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated code, I have determined that the original assessment was None, meaning there was no assessment provided. Now, after analyzing the annotated code, I can see that the code appears to be implementing the correct logic for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

The `func_1` function checks if a number is prime, and the `func_2` function uses this to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The annotated code provides a clear explanation of the state of the program at different points, which helps to understand the logic of the code.

The only potential issue with the code is that it does not handle cases where the input `n` is not a positive integer. However, as stated in the problem description, we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program.

Therefore, based on the information available, I believe that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
