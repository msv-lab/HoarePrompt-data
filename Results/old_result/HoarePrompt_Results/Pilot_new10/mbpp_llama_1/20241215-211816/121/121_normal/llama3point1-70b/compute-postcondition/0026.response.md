Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is 9, the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument returns an unknown value. If `count` is equal to `n`, the program returns `num` which is 9. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to the variables. Additionally, the conditions on `count` and `n` from the precondition hold: if `n` is 2, then `count` was initially equal to `n` but is not equal after increment, if `n` is 3, `count` is not equal to `n`, and for other values of `n`, `count` is not equal to `n` unless `n` equals 2, which has already been considered.**
