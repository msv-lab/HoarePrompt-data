The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the `n`th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The code first checks if `n` is 1, in which case it returns 7. Otherwise, it initializes a counter `count` to 1 and a number `num` to 7, then enters an infinite loop. Inside the loop, it checks if `num` is a prime number using the function `func_1` and if `num` modulo 6 is either 1 or 5. If both conditions are met, it increments the counter. When the counter equals `n`, it returns `num`. 

However, the code does not handle the case where `n` is less than 1 or not an integer, and the loop's behavior is undefined if no such `num` exists that makes `count` equal to `n`. Also, the annotations mention the function returning 8 or 9, but based on the given code, these values are not explicitly returned. 

Therefore, considering all potential cases and edge cases, the functionality of the function is to return the `n`th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number if `n` is a positive integer, with `n` equal to 1 returning 7, and for other values of `n`, it returns the `n`th number that satisfies the conditions of being a prime and having a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the `n`th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which is 7 if `n` is 1, and for `n` greater than 1, it returns the `n`th number that is a prime and has a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6, with undefined behavior for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs. **
