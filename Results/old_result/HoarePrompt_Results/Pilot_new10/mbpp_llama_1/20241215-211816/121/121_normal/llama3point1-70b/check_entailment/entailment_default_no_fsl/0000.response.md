Correctness: **False**

The given code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, function_2 does not handle cases where n is less than or equal to 0 or where n is not an integer. The function only checks for the case where n is 1, but it does not account for other non-positive integers or non-integer inputs.

Additionally, the function does not check if the input n is an integer, it only checks for the case where n is 1. If n is a non-integer or a negative integer, the function may enter an infinite loop or produce incorrect results.

The function also does not handle the case where n is greater than the number of Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers that exist. In this case, the function will enter an infinite loop and will not produce a result.

The function func_1 is correct in checking if a number is prime, but the function func_2 does not correctly handle all the edge cases for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

For example, if n is 0 or a negative number, the function func_2 will not produce a correct result, or if n is a non-integer, the function will not produce a correct result. 

The output hints agree with the code, and they indicate that the function has undefined behavior for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs, which confirms the conclusion that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
