According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n + 1` and greater than or equal to 2, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is greater than 3. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 4, and `n` must be greater than 4 to satisfy the loop condition `i` in `range(2, n + 1)`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 7**
