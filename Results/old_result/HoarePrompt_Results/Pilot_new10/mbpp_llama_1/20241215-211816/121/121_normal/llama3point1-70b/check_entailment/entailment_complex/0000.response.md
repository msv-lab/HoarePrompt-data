Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to correctly implement the logic for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 

The problem description requires a function that given a positive integer `n`, returns the `n`th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. A Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is defined as a prime number that is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6.

Function `func_1` checks whether a given number is prime or not. The function correctly returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number, which is an efficient approach to check for primality.

Function `func_2` uses `func_1` to find the `n`th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. For `n` equal to 1, it directly returns 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime. For `n` greater than 1, it starts checking numbers from 7 and uses `func_1` to check for primality. It also checks if the number is congruent to 1 or 5 modulo 6. If both conditions are met, it increments the count of Newman-Shanks-Williams primes found so far. Once it finds the `n`th such prime, it returns that number.

The annotations provided with the code are consistent with its behavior. The code handles the edge case where `n` is 1 correctly and it also correctly handles the case where `n` is greater than 1 by finding the `n`th Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

There are no obvious cases where the code would not work as expected according to the problem description. The code handles the cases for `n` equal to 1 and `n` greater than 1 correctly, and it checks for primality and congruence to 1 or 5 modulo 6 as required by the problem description.
