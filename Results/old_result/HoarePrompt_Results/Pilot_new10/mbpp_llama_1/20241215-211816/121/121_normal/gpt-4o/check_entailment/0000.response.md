Correctness: **False**.

The program does not follow the problem description because it does not generate Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime sequence is a sequence of prime numbers P(n) defined by the recurrence relation: P(n) = 2 * P(n-1) + P(n-2), with initial conditions P(0) = 7 and P(1) = 17. 

The provided program does not match this definition. It starts with S0 = 1 and S1 = 1, and generates the sequence using the same recurrence relation, but with different initial conditions. Therefore, it does not correctly generate Newman-Shanks-Williams prime numbers. 

For example, func_1(0) should return 7 (the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime), but it returns 1, which is not a prime number and not the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime. 

This is a clear case where the program does not work as expected, so its correctness is **False**.
