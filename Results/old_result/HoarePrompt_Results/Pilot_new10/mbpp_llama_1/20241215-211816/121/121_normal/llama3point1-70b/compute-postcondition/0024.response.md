The code increments the value of `count` by 1. The initial value of `count` is 1 and not equal to `n`, unless `n` is 2, in which case `count` equals `n`. After the increment, `count` will be 2. 

If `n` is 2, then `count` was initially equal to `n` (i.e., 1), and now `count` is 2, which means `count` is no longer equal to `n`. 

If `n` is not 2, then `count` was initially not equal to `n`, and after the increment, it is still not equal to `n`, unless `n` is 3, in which case `count` is now equal to `n` (i.e., 2 = 2 is false, but 2 = 3 is false too, but if n = 3 then 2 = n is false and now count = 2 and n = 3 so they are not equal, however if n = 2 before the count update then count = 1 and n =2 so they were equal, now count = 2 and n =2 are not equal).

However we must consider two options:

1. if n = 2 then count = n = 1 before the increment and count = 2 and n = 2 after the increment, so now count is not equal to n.
2. if n is not equal to 2 but n = 3, then before the increment count = 1 and n = 3 so they are not equal, and after the increment count = 2 and n = 3, so they are not equal.



`n` is still a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is still 9, the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument still returns an unknown value.


Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is 9, the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument returns an unknown value, `count` is 2 and if `n` is 2, then before the increment `count` was equal to `n` but after the increment is not equal to `n`, if `n` is 3, then `count` is not equal to `n`, if `n` is neither 2 nor 3, then `count` is not equal to `n` unless `n` equals to 2, but we already treated the case when `n` equals 2.**
