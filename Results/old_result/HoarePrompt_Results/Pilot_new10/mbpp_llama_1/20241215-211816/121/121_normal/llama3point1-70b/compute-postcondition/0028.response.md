Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is 9, the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument returns an unknown value. If `func_1(num)` is true and `num` % 6 is in [1, 5] and `count` is equal to `n`, the program returns `num` which is 9. Otherwise, no specific changes are made to the variables, and the conditions on `count` and `n` from the precondition hold: if `n` is 2, then `count` was initially equal to `n`, and for other values of `n`, `count` is not equal to `n` unless `n` equals 2; however, the initial condition that if `n` is 2, `count` equals `n` will be broken if `count` is incremented. For all cases, `num` remains 9, and `n` remains a positive integer not equal to 1.**
