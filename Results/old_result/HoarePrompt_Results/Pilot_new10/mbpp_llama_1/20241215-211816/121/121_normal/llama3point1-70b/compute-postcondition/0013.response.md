Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is 7, the function `func_1` called with `num` as an argument returns `True`. If `num` has a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6, then `count` is 2 and `count` is not equal to `n`. Otherwise, the state of `count` is unchanged, as there is no else part to handle this condition.**
