The value of `num` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `num` is 9, so the new value of `num` is 10. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is 10, the function `func_1` called with the previous value of `num` (which was 9) as an argument returns an unknown value. The condition that if `n` is 2, then `count` was initially equal to `n`, and for other values of `n`, `count` is not equal to `n` unless `n` equals 2, still holds but `count` is not equal to `n` if `n` equals 2 and `count` was previously incremented. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and not equal to 1, `num` is 10, the function `func_1` called with 9 as an argument returns an unknown value, if `n` is 2, then `count` was initially equal to `n`, and for other values of `n`, `count` is not equal to `n` unless `n` equals 2 and `count` was not incremented**
