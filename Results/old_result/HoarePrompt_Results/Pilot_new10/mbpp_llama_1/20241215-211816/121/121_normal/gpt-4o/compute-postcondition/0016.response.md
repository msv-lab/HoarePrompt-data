The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n`. According to the annotated code, if `n` is 0 or 1, the function returns 1. For `n` greater than 1, the function calculates a sequence where each term is `2 * previous_term + term_before_previous`, starting with `S0` and `S1` both as 1, and returns the last term `S1` in the sequence.

Looking at the code, it seems the annotations accurately describe its behavior for the given conditions. However, we must consider all potential edge cases, including negative integers and non-integer inputs, which are not explicitly addressed in the annotations.

- For `n = 0` or `n = 1`, the function correctly returns 1 as per the annotations.
- For `n > 1`, the function calculates and returns the `n`-th term of the sequence as described.
- The function does not handle cases where `n` is a negative integer or a non-integer (float, complex number, etc.). In Python, the `range` function will throw an error for negative integers or non-integer values, indicating these are not valid inputs for `n`.
- There's also the consideration of what happens when `n` is a very large number, potentially leading to overflow errors in the calculation of `S_next`. However, Python's arbitrary-precision arithmetic mitigates this concern for most practical purposes.

Thus, considering the code's actual behavior and the potential edge cases not explicitly covered by the annotations, the functionality of `func_1` can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n`, returns 1 if `n` is 0 or 1, and for `n > 1`, returns the `n`-th term of a sequence where each term is calculated as `2 * previous_term + term_before_previous`. The function is designed for non-negative integer inputs and may throw errors for negative integers or non-integer inputs due to the nature of the `range` function in Python. **
