The function accepts an integer `n`, returns 1 if `n` is 0 or 1, and for `n > 1`, returns the `n`-th term of a sequence where each term is calculated as `2 * previous_term + term_before_previous`. The function is designed for non-negative integer inputs and may throw errors for negative integers or non-integer inputs due to the nature of the `range` function in Python.
