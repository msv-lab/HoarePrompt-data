According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will always execute as long as the program is running and no breaking conditions are met within the loop body. Since the loop condition is always `True`, no adjustments to the program state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer and `n` is not equal to 1, `count` is 1, `num` is 7**
