The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on two possible cases. 
Case_1: The function returns 1. 
Case_2: The function returns S1, which is the last term in a sequence where each term is calculated based on the two preceding terms. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and return either 1 or the last term S1 in a sequence, depending on the conditions that define these two cases.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns 1 in Case_1, or the last term S1 of a sequence in Case_2, where the sequence's terms are calculated based on the two preceding terms.**
