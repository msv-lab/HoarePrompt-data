The original assessment is None, which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. However, after analyzing the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, we can assess the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks for a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. The provided code defines two functions: `func_1` checks if a number is prime, and `func_2` finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. 

The `func_1` function correctly checks for primality by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number.

The `func_2` function starts with 7 and checks each subsequent number for primality using `func_1`. If the number is prime and has a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6, it increments the count. When the count reaches `n`, it returns the corresponding prime number.

The output hints for `func_1` and `func_2` accurately describe their behavior.

Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to be correct. It implements the required functionality to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number, which is a prime number that has a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6.

The reason why the original assessment was not accurate is that there was no assessment provided. However, after reviewing the code and output hints, we can confidently assess the program's correctness.

Final: **True**
