Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for several reasons:

1. **Problem Description vs. Functionality**: The problem description asks for a function to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. However, the provided function calculates the nth term of a sequence where each term is `2 * previous_term + term_before_previous`, starting with `S0` and `S1` as 1. There's no direct relation to prime numbers in the function's logic.

2. **Sequence Calculation vs. Prime Number Identification**: The function returns the nth term of a specific sequence but does not check if this term is a prime number. The Newman-Shanks-Williams prime sequence specifically refers to a sequence of prime numbers where each term is of the form `2^n + 1` and is a prime number, not the sequence generated by the given formula.

3. **Lack of Prime Checking**: To identify the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime, the function would need to generate numbers of the form `2^n + 1` and check each for primality, then count how many of these are prime until it reaches the nth prime. The current implementation does not perform any primality checks.

4. **Incorrect Formula**: The formula used in the function (`2 * S1 + S0`) does not correspond to the formula for Newman-Shanks-Williams primes, which involves powers of 2 and adding 1 (`2^n + 1`).

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect for the task of finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.
