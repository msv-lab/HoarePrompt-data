To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 4
- `S0` is 3
- `S1` is 7
- `i` is 4
- `S_next` is 7

The code to be executed is:
```python
S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
```

Using the initial state values for `S0` and `S1`:
- `S0` = 3
- `S1` = 7

Substitute these values into the equation:
```python
S_next = 2 * 7 + 3
```

Calculate the value of `S_next`:
```python
S_next = 14 + 3
S_next = 17
```

So, `S_next` is updated to 17.

The values of `n`, `S0`, `S1`, and `i` are not changed by the code. Only `S_next` is updated.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 4
- `S0` is 3
- `S1` is 7
- `i` is 4
- `S_next` is 17

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 4, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 4, `S_next` is 17**
