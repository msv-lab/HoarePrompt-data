The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`. `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, where all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of averages. Each average in the list corresponds to the mean of the numbers in the same position across all inner tuples in `tuples`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple of tuples with numbers, returns a list of averages where each average is the mean of the numbers in the same position across all inner tuples.**
