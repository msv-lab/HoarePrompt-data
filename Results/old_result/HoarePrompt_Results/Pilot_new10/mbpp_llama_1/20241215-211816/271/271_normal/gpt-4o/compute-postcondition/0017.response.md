To understand the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's break down the provided information:

1. The function accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a tuple of tuples. Each inner tuple is expected to have the same length and contain numbers.
2. The function calculates the average of elements at each position across all inner tuples.
3. The averages are then returned as a list, where each average corresponds to the mean of elements at the same position across all inner tuples.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases and the actual code behavior:

- If `tuples` is empty (i.e., it contains no inner tuples), `num_elements` will be 0 (since `len(tuples[0])` will raise an `IndexError`), but the code does not explicitly handle this case before attempting to access `tuples[0]`. Thus, an `IndexError` will be raised in such a scenario.
- If the inner tuples are not all of the same length, the list comprehension `[t[i] for t in tuples]` will raise an `IndexError` for the shorter tuples when `i` exceeds their length.
- If the inner tuples contain non-numeric values, the `sum` function will raise a `TypeError` when attempting to sum these values.

Given these considerations, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple of tuples with the same length and containing numbers, and returns a list of averages where each average is the mean of elements at the same position across all inner tuples. However, it does not handle cases where the input tuple is empty, or where inner tuples are of different lengths, or where inner tuples contain non-numeric values, potentially raising IndexError or TypeError in such scenarios. **
