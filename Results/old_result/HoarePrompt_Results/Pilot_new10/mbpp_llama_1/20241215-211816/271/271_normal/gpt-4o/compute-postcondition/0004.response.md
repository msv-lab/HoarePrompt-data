To calculate the result, we first need to understand the given initial state and the provided code snippet. 

Given:
- `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers.
- `num_elements` is greater than 0 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple.
- `averages` is an empty list.
- `i` is 0.
- `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
```

The impact of this code on the program is the calculation of the average of the first elements of all inner tuples in `tuples` and assigning this value to the variable `avg`.

Given that `elements_at_position` contains the first elements of all inner tuples, the `sum(elements_at_position)` calculates the total sum of these first elements, and `len(tuples)` gives the total number of inner tuples.

Thus, `avg` becomes the sum of the first elements of all inner tuples divided by the total number of inner tuples.

The states of the other variables (`tuples`, `num_elements`, `averages`, `i`, and `elements_at_position`) are not affected by this line of code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`avg` equals the sum of the first elements of all inner tuples in `tuples` divided by the number of inner tuples, `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 0 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple, `averages` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 0 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple, `averages` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the first elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`, `avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`**
