The `averages` list is appended with the value of `avg`. The value of `avg` is calculated as `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, where `elements_at_position` is a list containing the elements at the current position `i` in all inner tuples in `tuples`. 

Since the initial state is: 
- `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers
- `num_elements` is greater than 2 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple
- `averages` is a list
- `i` is 2
- `elements_at_position` is a list containing the elements at the current position `i` in all inner tuples in `tuples`
- `avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`

The `averages` list now contains the average of elements at position `i` in all inner tuples. 
Other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, 
`num_elements` is greater than 2 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple, 
`averages` is a list containing the average of elements at position `i` in all inner tuples, 
`i` is 2, 
`elements_at_position` is a list containing the elements at the current position `i` in all inner tuples in `tuples`, 
`avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)` and it has been returned at the output state as a new element in `averages`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 2 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple, `averages` is a list containing `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the elements at the current position `i` in all inner tuples in `tuples`, `avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)` and has been appended to `averages`.**
