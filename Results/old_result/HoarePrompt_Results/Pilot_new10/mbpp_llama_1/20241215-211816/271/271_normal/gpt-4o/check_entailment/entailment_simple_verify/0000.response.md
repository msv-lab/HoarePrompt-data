To determine the correctness of the program, let's examine the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description asks for a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

The original assessment is "None", which implies that there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness.

The annotated version of the code provides insight into the state of the program at different points. It describes the function `func_1` and its purpose, which aligns with the problem description. The annotations suggest that the function is designed to calculate the average of elements at each position across all inner tuples in the input tuple.

Upon reviewing the code and the annotations, the function appears to be correctly implemented. It iterates over each position in the inner tuples, calculates the average of the elements at that position, and appends this average to the list of averages. The final list of averages is then returned.

The code handles the calculation of averages correctly, and the annotations accurately describe the state of the program at different points. Therefore, the original assessment of "None" simply indicates a lack of initial evaluation rather than any issue with the program's correctness.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Hence, the final assessment of the program's correctness should indicate that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
