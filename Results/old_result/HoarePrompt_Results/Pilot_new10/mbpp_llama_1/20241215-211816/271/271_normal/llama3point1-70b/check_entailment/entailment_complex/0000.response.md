Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the required functionality. 

Here's a breakdown of why it meets the problem description:

- The problem asks for a function that takes a tuple of tuples and returns a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.
- The provided function `func_1(tuples)` uses the built-in `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the tuple of tuples. This effectively groups the corresponding elements from each inner tuple together.
- It then uses a list comprehension to calculate the average of each group of corresponding elements. The `sum(val) / len(tuples)` expression calculates the sum of the elements in each group and divides by the total number of tuples (which is the same as the number of elements in each group, since all inner tuples have the same length).
- The result is a list of averages, where each average corresponds to the mean of the numbers in the same position across all inner tuples in `tuples`, which exactly matches the problem description.

The program assumes that the input tuple of tuples is valid (i.e., all inner tuples have the same length and contain numbers). If the input may be invalid, additional error checking code would be necessary to handle exceptions. However, based on the problem description, the program is correct for the specified conditions. 

One potential point of improvement could be adding error checking code to handle cases where the input tuple of tuples is empty, or where the inner tuples contain non-numeric values or have different lengths. But, according to the given problem description and the provided annotations, the function is doing exactly what the problem description asks for, given the assumption of valid input.
