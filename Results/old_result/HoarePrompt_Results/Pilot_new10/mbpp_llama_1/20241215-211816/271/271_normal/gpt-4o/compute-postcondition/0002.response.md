According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_elements`. If `num_elements` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `tuples` is a tuple of tuples, `num_elements` is equal to the length of any inner tuple, and `averages` is an empty list. For the loop to execute, `num_elements` must be greater than 0, and `i` is now 0, which is the starting index of the loop.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` must be greater than 0 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple, `averages` is an empty list, `i` is 0**
