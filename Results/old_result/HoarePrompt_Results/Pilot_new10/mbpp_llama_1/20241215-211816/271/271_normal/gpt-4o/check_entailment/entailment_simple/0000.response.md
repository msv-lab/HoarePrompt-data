Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program takes a tuple of tuples (`tuples`) as input and returns a list of averages (`averages`).

2. The program calculates the length of the inner tuples (`num_elements`) and initializes an empty list (`averages`) to store the averages.

3. The program then iterates over each position in the inner tuples using a for loop.

4. Inside the loop, it uses a list comprehension to extract the elements at the current position (`i`) from all inner tuples (`elements_at_position`).

5. It then calculates the average of these elements by summing them up and dividing by the number of inner tuples (`len(tuples)`).

6. The calculated average is appended to the `averages` list.

7. After the loop finishes, the program returns the `averages` list.

This process ensures that each element in the returned list is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the program works as expected for different inputs.

In every potential case, the program correctly calculates the averages of elements at each position across all inner tuples and returns them in a list, which meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
