Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle cases where the input tuple is empty, or where inner tuples are of different lengths, or where inner tuples contain non-numeric values. If the input tuple is empty, the function will raise an IndexError when trying to access `tuples[0]`. If inner tuples are of different lengths, the function will also raise an IndexError when trying to access an index that does not exist in one of the tuples. If inner tuples contain non-numeric values, the function will raise a TypeError when trying to calculate the sum of the elements. 

For example, if the input is an empty tuple, `func_1(())`, the function will raise an IndexError. Similarly, if the input is a tuple with inner tuples of different lengths, `func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)))`, the function will raise an IndexError. If the input is a tuple with inner tuples containing non-numeric values, `func_1(((1, 2), (3, 'a')))`, the function will raise a TypeError. 

These cases are not handled by the function, therefore the Correctness is **False**.
