The given Python code is a list comprehension that iterates over each tuple `t` in `tuples` and extracts the element at index `i`. Since `i` is 1, it extracts the second elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`. 

The impact of the code on the program is that it updates the `elements_at_position` list with the second elements of all inner tuples. 

Before the code is executed, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`. 

After the code is executed, `elements_at_position` is updated to contain the elements at position `i` (which is 1) in all inner tuples in `tuples`, which means it still contains the second elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `averages` is still the list containing the average of the first elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`. 

The value of `num_elements` is still greater than 1 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple.

The value of `avg` was `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, and since `elements_at_position` has been updated, `avg` is now `sum([t[1] for t in tuples]) / len(tuples)`, which is the average of the second elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 1 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple, `averages` is a list containing the average of the first elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`, `avg` is `sum([t[1] for t in tuples]) / len(tuples)`.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 1 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple, `averages` is a list containing the average of the first elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`, `avg` is `sum([t[1] for t in tuples]) / len(tuples)`**
