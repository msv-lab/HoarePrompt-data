To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers.
- `num_elements` is greater than 1 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple.
- `averages` is a list containing the average of the first elements of all inner tuples in `tuples` and `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.
- `i` is 1.
- `elements_at_position` is a list containing the second elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`.
- `avg` is `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.

The loop statement is `for i in range(num_elements):`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `num_elements`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` should be 2.

Given that `num_elements` is greater than 1 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple, and since `i` has been incremented to 2, `num_elements` must still be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

The list `elements_at_position` currently contains the second elements of all inner tuples. When `i` increments to 2, `elements_at_position` should contain the third elements of all inner tuples for the loop to execute the next iteration correctly.

The average `avg` is calculated based on `elements_at_position`. Since `elements_at_position` will now contain the third elements of all inner tuples, `avg` will be recalculated as `sum` of these third elements divided by `len(tuples)`.

The state of `tuples` and the fact that `averages` contains averages of elements at different positions do not directly affect the condition for the loop to execute the next iteration, given the loop statement `for i in range(num_elements):`. However, it's implied that as `i` progresses, `averages` would be updated to include the average of the elements at the current `i-th` position across all tuples.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers, `num_elements` is greater than 2 and is equal to the length of any inner tuple, `averages` is a list that will be updated to include the average of elements at the current position, `i` is 2, `elements_at_position` is a list containing the third elements of all inner tuples in `tuples`, `avg` is `sum` of the third elements of all inner tuples divided by `len(tuples)`**
