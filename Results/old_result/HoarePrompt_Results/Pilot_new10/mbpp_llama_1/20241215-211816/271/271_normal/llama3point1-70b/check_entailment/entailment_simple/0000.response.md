The given Python program is:
```python
def func_1(tuples):
    return [(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```
At first glance, the program seems to be doing what the problem description asks for. However, let's analyze it more closely.

The `zip(*tuples)` expression transposes the tuples, i.e., it groups the i-th elements of each tuple together. The `sum(val)` expression calculates the sum of each group, and `len(tuples)` gives the number of tuples.

The key point here is that the program is dividing the sum of each group by the total number of tuples (`len(tuples)`), which is correct because we want to calculate the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

So, the program correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple.

Correctness: **True**

This program is correct because it correctly implements the required functionality as specified in the problem description. It calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple by summing the values at each position across all tuples and then dividing by the total number of tuples. 

Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. The `zip(*tuples)` expression groups the corresponding values from each tuple together.
2. The `sum(val)` expression calculates the sum of each group of values.
3. The `len(tuples)` expression gives the total number of tuples, which is used to calculate the average.

Therefore, the program correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple, as required by the problem description. 

Example:
```python
tuples = ((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))
result = func_1(tuples)
print(result)  # Output: [4.0, 5.0, 6.0]
```
In this example, the program correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple: `(1+4+7)/3 = 4.0`, `(2+5+8)/3 = 5.0`, and `(3+6+9)/3 = 6.0`.
