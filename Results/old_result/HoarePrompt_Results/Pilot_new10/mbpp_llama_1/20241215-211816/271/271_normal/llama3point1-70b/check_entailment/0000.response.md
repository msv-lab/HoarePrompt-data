Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it accurately calculates the average of corresponding values from each tuple in the input tuple of tuples. 

Here's why it works:

- The `zip(*tuples)` expression unpacks the input tuple of tuples and groups corresponding elements together from each tuple. For example, if the input is `((1, 2, 3), (4, 5, 6), (7, 8, 9))`, `zip(*tuples)` would yield `[(1, 4, 7), (2, 5, 8), (3, 6, 9)]`.

- The list comprehension then calculates the average of each group by summing the values and dividing by the number of tuples. The `len(tuples)` expression correctly gives the number of tuples, and `sum(val)` correctly sums the values in each group.

This approach correctly handles tuples of any length and any number of tuples, as long as all tuples have the same length. It will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if the input tuple of tuples is empty, which is a reasonable behavior. However, it's worth noting that the problem description does not specify what to do in this case.

To make the function more robust, you could add a check to handle the case where the input tuple of tuples is empty:

```python
def func_1(tuples):
    if not tuples:
        return []
    return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

But as it stands, the program correctly implements the described behavior for all non-empty inputs with tuples of the same length.
