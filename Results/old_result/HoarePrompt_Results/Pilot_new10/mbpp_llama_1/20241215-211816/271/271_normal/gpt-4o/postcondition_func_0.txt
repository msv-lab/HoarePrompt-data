The function accepts a tuple of tuples with the same length and containing numbers, and returns a list of averages where each average is the mean of elements at the same position across all inner tuples. However, it does not handle cases where the input tuple is empty, or where inner tuples are of different lengths, or where inner tuples contain non-numeric values, potentially raising IndexError or TypeError in such scenarios.
