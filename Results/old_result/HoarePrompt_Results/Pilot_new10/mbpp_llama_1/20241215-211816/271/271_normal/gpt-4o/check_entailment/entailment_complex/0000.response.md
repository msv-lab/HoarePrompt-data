Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of tuples as input, where each inner tuple has the same length and contains numbers. It then calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple at each position and returns a list of these averages.

Here's why the program always does what the problem description says:

1. **Input validation**: Although the program does not explicitly validate the input, the problem description implies that the input will always be a tuple of tuples with the same length and containing numbers. Therefore, the program is written with the assumption that this is the case.

2. **Calculating averages**: The program correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple at each position. It does this by iterating over each position in the tuples, collecting the values at that position from all tuples, summing these values, and then dividing by the total number of tuples.

3. **Handling edge cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases, such as when the input tuple is empty. In this case, the `num_elements` variable will be 0, and the `for` loop will not execute, resulting in an empty list being returned.

4. **Returning the correct output**: The program returns a list of averages, where each average is the mean of elements at the same position across all inner tuples. The length of this list is equal to the number of elements in each inner tuple, which meets the requirements of the problem description.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description and is correct. It correctly calculates the averages of corresponding values from each tuple at each position and returns a list of these averages, as required by the problem description.
