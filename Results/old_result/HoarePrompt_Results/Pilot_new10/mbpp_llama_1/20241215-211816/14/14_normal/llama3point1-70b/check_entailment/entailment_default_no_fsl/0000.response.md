Correctness: **False**

The code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` checks for duplicate elements in the array, but it does not handle unhashable types correctly. According to the output hints, if the list contains unhashable types, the function may raise a TypeError. For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, [3, 4]]`, the function will raise a TypeError because lists are unhashable types and cannot be added to a set. 

This means the function does not work as expected for lists containing unhashable types, which is a potential case not handled by the function. Therefore, the program is considered incorrect. 

To fix this, the function could be modified to handle unhashable types, for example, by converting them to a hashable type (like a tuple) before adding them to the set, or by raising a custom error message when it encounters an unhashable type. 

Here's a possible way to modify the function to handle unhashable types:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    try:
        return len(arr)!= len(set(arr))
    except TypeError:
        raise ValueError("The input list contains unhashable types")
```
