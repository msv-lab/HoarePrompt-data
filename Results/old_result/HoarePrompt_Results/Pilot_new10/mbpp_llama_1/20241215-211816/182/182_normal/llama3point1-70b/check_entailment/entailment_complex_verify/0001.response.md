The original assessment seems to be mostly correct, as it thoroughly examines the potential cases and concludes that the function works correctly for all of them. The annotated version of the code also supports this conclusion, as it explains the state of the program before and after the function call.

However, upon closer inspection, the problem description asks to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple. The original assessment and the annotated version both agree that the function will work correctly for tuples containing multiple strings, but they also mention that the function will handle sequences in general, not just strings.

The provided code, `def func_1(strings): return [s[-1] for s in strings]`, uses `s[-1]` to extract the last element of each sequence in the tuple, which works correctly for strings, but the problem description specifically mentions strings. 

However, given that we assume the input of the program will be valid, this means the input will always be a tuple of strings. Therefore, `s[-1]` will always return the last character of each string, which is the expected behavior according to the problem description.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
