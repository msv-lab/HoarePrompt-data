Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description in the case where the input tuple contains an empty string. According to the problem description, the function should handle empty sequences by adding an empty string to the list. However, the given program will raise an "IndexError: string index out of range" exception when it tries to access the last character of an empty string using `s[-1]`. 

For example, if the input tuple is `("", "hello", "world")`, the program will throw an error when trying to access the last character of the first string. 

To meet the problem description, the program should be modified to handle this case, for instance by checking if the string is empty before trying to access its last character:

```
def func_1(strings):
    return [s[-1] if s else "" for s in strings]
```
