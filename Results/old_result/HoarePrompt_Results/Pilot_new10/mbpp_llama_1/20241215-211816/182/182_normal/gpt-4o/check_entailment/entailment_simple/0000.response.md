Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple.

The line `return [s[-1] for s in tup]` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the tuple `tup`. The expression `s[-1]` accesses the last character of each string `s`, because in Python, negative indices count from the end of the string. The resulting list of last characters is then returned by the function.

This program correctly handles tuples of strings of any length and always returns the last character of each string. The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function for various input cases.

For example, if the input tuple is `('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')`, the function will return `['s', 'r', 's']`, which are the last characters of each string in the tuple. This matches the expected output described in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and always does what the problem description says.
