You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract only the rear index element of each string in the given tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1(('Mers', 'for', 'Vers')) == ['s', 'r', 's']
assert func_1(('Avenge', 'for', 'People')) == ['e', 'r', 'e']
assert func_1(('Gotta', 'get', 'go')) == ['a', 't', 'o']

def func_1(tup):
    return [s[-1] for s in tup]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it successfully extracts the rear index element of each string in the given tuple. The function `func_1` uses a list comprehension to iterate over each string `s` in the tuple `tup` and returns a list of the last characters of each string, which is achieved by `s[-1]`.

This approach works for all potential cases, including tuples with strings of varying lengths and contents. The unit tests provided in the problem description also support this conclusion, as the function returns the expected results for different inputs.

In general, this program will work correctly for any tuple of strings, regardless of the strings' lengths or contents, because Python's indexing syntax (`s[-1]`) is designed to handle this case. It will always return the last character of a string, or an empty string if the input string is empty. However, since there are no unit tests provided for empty strings, it's worth noting that the function will return an empty string for an empty string input, which may or may not be the desired behavior depending on the context. But based on the given problem description and unit tests, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a tuple of strings, returns a list of the last characters of each non-empty string in the tuple, and raises an IndexError if any string in the tuple is empty. If the tuple is empty, it returns an empty list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
