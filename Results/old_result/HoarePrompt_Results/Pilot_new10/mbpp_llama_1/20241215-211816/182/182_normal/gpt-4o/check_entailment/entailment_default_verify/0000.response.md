The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function correctly extracts the last character of each string in the tuple. The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a list of last characters of each non-empty string in the tuple and raising an IndexError if any string in the tuple is empty.

However, a closer examination reveals that the original assessment might not be entirely accurate. The output hints state that the function raises an IndexError if any string in the tuple is empty, but the provided code does not explicitly handle this case. Instead, it uses the expression `s[-1]`, which would raise an IndexError if `s` is an empty string. This means that the function is correct in its behavior for non-empty strings but could be improved for error handling.

Given that the input is assumed to be valid, the provided code should work as expected. However, the output hints suggest that the function should raise an IndexError for empty strings, which is indeed the default behavior of the expression `s[-1]` in Python. Therefore, the original assessment is mostly accurate, but with a slight nuance regarding error handling.

The reason I decided to keep the original assessment as mostly accurate is that the provided code does indeed extract the last character of each string in the tuple correctly, assuming the input is valid. The output hints provide additional information on the function's behavior but do not fundamentally alter the assessment of the code's correctness in terms of its primary function.

Final: **True**
