Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function `func_1` takes an array as input, finds the maximum and minimum elements in the array using the built-in `max` and `min` functions, and then returns the difference between these two values. This difference is indeed the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array, as it represents the difference between the largest and smallest values.

This approach works correctly for all possible input arrays, including edge cases such as:

* Empty arrays are not considered, as the problem description does not specify how to handle this case. However, in Python, `max` and `min` will raise a `ValueError` if the input array is empty, which could be considered a valid response.
* Arrays with a single element, in which case the maximum difference is 0.
* Arrays with duplicate maximum or minimum values, in which case the difference is still calculated correctly.
* Arrays with negative numbers or zero, in which case the difference is still calculated correctly.

Overall, the program is a simple and efficient solution to the problem, and it works correctly for all possible input arrays.
