The original assessment is "None", which means there is no prior evaluation of the program's correctness. 

The problem description asks for a function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided code calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array, which indeed represents the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array.

The annotated version of the code confirms this interpretation, stating that the program returns the difference between the largest and smallest integers in the list `arr`.

Based on the problem description and the annotated code, it appears that the program is correct. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element, which is a straightforward and efficient approach.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code.

Final: **True**
