To assess the correctness of the given Python program, let's break down the problem and the provided information.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a Python function that finds the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. This implies the function should return the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array.

2. **Original Assessment**: There is no original assessment provided, indicating no prior judgment on the program's correctness.

3. **Annotated Version of the Program**: The program calculates the minimum and maximum values in the input array and returns their difference. The annotations describe the program's state at different points, including the beginning and end of the function execution. The function is expected to work with a list of integers (tuples in the provided test cases) and will return the difference between the largest and smallest integers. 

4. **Code Review**: The provided Python function, `func_1`, takes an array (implemented as a tuple in the test cases) and correctly identifies the minimum and maximum values using the built-in `min()` and `max()` functions. It then calculates the difference between these two extreme values and returns this difference. This approach directly addresses the problem statement, as the maximum difference between any two elements will always be the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the array.

5. **Assumptions about Input**: The problem assumes valid input, meaning the array is not empty and contains at least two elements. The function does not include error checking for invalid inputs like empty arrays or non-integer values. However, based on the problem description and the provided test cases, the function behaves as expected for valid inputs.

Given the information above, the program seems to correctly implement the requested functionality according to the problem description and the annotations. The lack of an original assessment means there's no initial judgment to confirm or dispute. However, based on the analysis:

Final: **True**
