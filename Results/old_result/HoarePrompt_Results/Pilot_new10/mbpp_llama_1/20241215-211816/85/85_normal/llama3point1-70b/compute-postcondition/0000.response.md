To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet based on the initial state.

The initial state is that `arr` is a list of integers with at least two elements.

The code snippet is `return max(arr) - min(arr)`. 

Here, `max(arr)` finds the maximum integer value in the list `arr`, and `min(arr)` finds the minimum integer value in the list `arr`.

Since `arr` has at least two elements and all elements are integers, both `max(arr)` and `min(arr)` will be integers.

The subtraction operation `max(arr) - min(arr)` calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in `arr`.

This difference will also be an integer because both the maximum and minimum values are integers.

Therefore, the program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list `arr`.**
