The original assessment is "None", which means there is no initial assessment to evaluate. Therefore, we can directly evaluate the program's correctness based on the problem description and the provided annotated code.

The problem description asks to write a Python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The provided function, `func_1(arr)`, calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the array, which is equivalent to finding the maximum difference between any two elements in the array.

The annotated code provides additional context, stating that the function accepts a list of integers, returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integer values in the list, and can handle lists with non-integer values or extremely large/small integers. This annotation is consistent with the problem description and the provided code.

Based on the information available, the program appears to be correct. It calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the array by finding the difference between the maximum and minimum values, which is the expected behavior.

Final: **True**
