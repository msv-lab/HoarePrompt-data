Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1(arr)`, calculates the difference between the maximum and minimum elements in the given array. According to the problem description, this function is expected to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. The given function satisfies this condition because the maximum difference between any two elements in an array will always be the difference between the maximum and minimum elements.

The output hints also confirm that the function behaves as expected: it raises an error if the list is empty (because `min()` and `max()` raise a `ValueError` for an empty sequence), returns 0 if the list contains a single element, and can handle lists with non-integer values or extremely large/small integers, returning the difference between the maximum and minimum values in these cases.

Given that the function handles all potential cases, including empty lists (although it raises an error, which might be considered a correct behavior in the context of finding the maximum difference), single-element lists, and lists with diverse data types, and it always calculates the maximum possible difference between any two elements in the array, the function is correct according to the provided problem description and output hints.
