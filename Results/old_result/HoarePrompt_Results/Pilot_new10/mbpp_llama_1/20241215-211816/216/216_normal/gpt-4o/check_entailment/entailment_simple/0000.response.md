Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Here's why:

1. **Empty list handling**: The program correctly handles the case where the input list is empty. According to the problem description, an empty list should not be considered as containing consecutive numbers, and the program returns `False` in this case.

2. **Consecutive numbers check**: The program checks if the numbers in the list are consecutive by sorting the list and then iterating through it. If the difference between any two adjacent numbers is not 1, the program returns `False`, indicating that the numbers are not consecutive.

3. **Duplicate numbers handling**: The program also correctly handles cases where the list contains duplicate numbers. The sorting step ensures that duplicate numbers are adjacent to each other, and the consecutive numbers check will fail if there are duplicates, causing the program to return `False`.

4. **Single-element list handling**: The program correctly handles cases where the list contains only one element. Although the program will return `True` in this case, it is a reasonable interpretation that a list with a single element can be considered as containing consecutive numbers (a single number is always consecutive with itself).

5. **Correct output for test cases**: The program produces the correct output for the provided test cases:
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True` because the numbers are consecutive.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6])` returns `False` because the numbers are not consecutive.
   - `func_1([1, 2, 1])` returns `False` because the numbers are not consecutive (there are duplicates).

Overall, the program correctly determines whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
