According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `lst_sorted`. If `lst_sorted` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, and `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers equal to `lst`. This implies that `lst_sorted` is also not empty. However, for the loop to execute, `lst_sorted` must have at least 2 elements. At the start of the loop, `i` will be 0.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers equal to `lst` with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
