Postcondition: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers equal to `lst` with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0. The current value of `lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i]` is not equal to 1, meaning the difference between the second element and the first element of `lst_sorted` is not 1**
