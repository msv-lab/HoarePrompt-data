Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. It first sorts the list in ascending order and then checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If the difference is not 1 for any pair, it returns `False`, indicating that the list does not contain consecutive numbers.

Here's why I think the code is correct:

1. **Handling empty lists**: The function correctly handles empty lists by returning `False`.
2. **Handling unsorted lists**: The function sorts the list before checking for consecutive numbers, which ensures that the function works correctly even if the input list is not sorted.
3. **Checking for consecutive numbers**: The function correctly checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1, which is the definition of consecutive numbers.
4. **Handling duplicates**: The function correctly handles lists with duplicate numbers by returning `False`, as duplicate numbers are not considered consecutive.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function seems to handle all possible edge cases, including empty lists, unsorted lists, lists with duplicate numbers, and lists with non-consecutive numbers. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
