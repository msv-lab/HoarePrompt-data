The function func_1 accepts a list of integers as input. Upon examining the code, it first checks if the list is empty. If the list is empty, it immediately returns False. 

If the list is not empty, it sorts the list in ascending order and then checks each pair of adjacent elements to see if they are consecutive (i.e., their difference is 1). If it finds any pair that is not consecutive, it immediately returns False.

If the loop completes without finding any non-consecutive pairs, the function returns True, indicating that the list contains consecutive integers.

However, there's an edge case not explicitly covered by the annotations: when the list has less than 2 elements. In such cases, the loop doesn't execute because the range of the loop is empty (since `len(lst_sorted) - 1` is less than 1), and the function returns True. This means the function considers a list with a single element or no elements at all as containing "consecutive integers" in the sense that it doesn't contain any non-consecutive integers.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers and returns True if the list is non-empty and contains consecutive integers in any order, or if the list contains a single element; it returns False for an empty list or a list where any two adjacent elements in sorted order are not consecutive **
