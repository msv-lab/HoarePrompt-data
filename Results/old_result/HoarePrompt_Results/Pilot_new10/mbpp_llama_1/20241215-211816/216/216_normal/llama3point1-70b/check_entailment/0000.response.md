Correctness: **True**.

The given Python function `func_1` checks whether a list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list to ensure that the numbers are in ascending order. Then, it uses the `all` function with a generator expression to check if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. This effectively checks if the numbers are consecutive.

The function also checks if the length of the list is equal to the length of a set created from the list. This is to ensure that there are no duplicate numbers in the list, because if there were duplicates, the numbers would not be consecutive.

This function correctly handles all potential cases, including:

- Lists with negative numbers
- Lists with a mix of positive and negative numbers
- Lists with duplicate numbers (which are correctly identified as not being consecutive)
- Lists with only one element (which are correctly identified as being consecutive)

For example, `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True`, `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5])` returns `False`, and `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 4])` returns `False`. 

Overall, the function correctly checks whether a list contains consecutive numbers, making it a correct implementation of the problem description.
