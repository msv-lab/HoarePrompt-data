Correctness: **True**

The code checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. The function first checks if the list is empty, and if so, returns False. Then, it sorts the list and iterates through it to check if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers is 1. If it finds a pair of numbers that are not consecutive, it returns False. If it iterates through the entire list without finding such a pair, it returns True.

The code also correctly handles cases where the list contains duplicate numbers, as it uses sorting to ensure that the numbers are in the correct order before checking for consecutiveness.

However, it seems that the provided output hints have a small discrepancy with the problem description. The problem description does not mention anything about returning True for a list with a single element, but the output hints do. Nevertheless, the code still behaves correctly in this case, as a single element is considered consecutive.

The code passes the provided assertions, and there are no apparent cases where it would return an incorrect result. Therefore, the code seems to be correct for every potential case.
