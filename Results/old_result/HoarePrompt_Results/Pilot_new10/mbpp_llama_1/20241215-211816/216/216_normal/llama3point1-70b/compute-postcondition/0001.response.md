To determine the output state, let's break down the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is that `lst` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order.

The code snippet checks two conditions:
1. `all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))` - This condition checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements in the list is 1. This essentially verifies if the list contains consecutive integers.
2. `len(lst) == len(set(lst))` - This condition checks if the length of the list is equal to the length of a set created from the list. Since a set in Python only contains unique elements, this condition verifies if all elements in the list are unique.

Given that `lst` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, the code returns `True` if both conditions are met, meaning the list consists of consecutive integers with no duplicates. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

Output State: **The program returns True if the list 'lst' contains consecutive unique integers in ascending order, False otherwise**
