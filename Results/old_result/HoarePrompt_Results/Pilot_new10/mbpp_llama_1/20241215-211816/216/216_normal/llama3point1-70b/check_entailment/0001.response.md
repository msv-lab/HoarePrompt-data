Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

1. `lst.sort()`: This line sorts the list in ascending order. This is necessary because the problem description does not specify that the input list must be sorted.

2. `all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))))`: This line checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent numbers in the list is 1. This is the condition for numbers to be consecutive.

3. `len(lst) == len(set(lst))`: This line checks if all numbers in the list are unique. If there are any duplicate numbers, the lengths of the list and the set created from the list will be different.

The `all` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true. If at least one element is false, it returns `False`.

The `and` operator ensures that both conditions (consecutive numbers and uniqueness) must be met.

This function will correctly identify lists with consecutive numbers, such as [1, 2, 3, 4, 5], and will return `False` for lists with non-consecutive numbers or duplicates, such as [1, 2, 3, 5] or [1, 2, 2, 3].

For example, testing the function with the following inputs:
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `True`
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5])` returns `False`
- `func_1([1, 2, 2, 3])` returns `False`

In all cases, the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.
