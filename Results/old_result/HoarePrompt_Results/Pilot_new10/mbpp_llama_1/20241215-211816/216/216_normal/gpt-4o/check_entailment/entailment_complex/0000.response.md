Correctness: **True**

The given Python program meets the problem description's requirements. It checks if a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Handling empty list**: The program correctly returns `False` for an empty list, as specified in the problem description.

2. **Sorting the list**: The program sorts the input list, which allows it to check for consecutive numbers regardless of their original order.

3. **Checking for consecutive numbers**: The program iterates through the sorted list, checking if each pair of adjacent numbers is consecutive (i.e., their difference is 1). If it finds any pair that is not consecutive, it immediately returns `False`.

4. **Returning True for consecutive numbers**: If the program completes the iteration without finding any non-consecutive pairs, it returns `True`, indicating that the list contains consecutive numbers.

5. **Handling lists with a single element**: The program will return `True` for a list containing a single element, as there are no pairs of numbers to check for consecutiveness. This is consistent with the problem description, which asks if the list contains consecutive numbers or not.

The provided unit tests also validate the program's correctness:

- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True` because the numbers are consecutive.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False` because the numbers are not consecutive.
- `func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False` because the numbers are not consecutive (the list is not strictly increasing).

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description.
