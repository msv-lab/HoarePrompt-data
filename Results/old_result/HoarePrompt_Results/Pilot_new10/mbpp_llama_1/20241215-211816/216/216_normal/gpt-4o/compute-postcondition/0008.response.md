According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `lst_sorted`. If `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `lst` has at least 2 elements, `lst_sorted` has at least 2 elements and is equal to `lst`, and the difference between the second element and the first element of `lst_sorted` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1. Additionally, for the loop to execute again, the length of `lst_sorted` must be at least 2, and since `i` is now 1, the length of `lst_sorted` must be at least 3 for `i` to be less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. Also, since `lst_sorted` is equal to `lst`, `lst` must also have at least 3 elements. 

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 3 elements, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of integers equal to `lst` with at least 3 elements, `i` is 1**
