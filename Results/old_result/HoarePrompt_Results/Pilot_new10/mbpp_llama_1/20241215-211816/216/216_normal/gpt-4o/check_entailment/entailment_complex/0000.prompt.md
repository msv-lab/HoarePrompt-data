You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: lst is a list of integers, and the list is not empty
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is the original list of integers, `lst_sorted` is a sorted list of consecutive integers equal to `lst`, and if `lst` has at least 2 elements, the loop completes with `i` being the last index checked, indicating all elements in `lst_sorted` are consecutive; if `lst` has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and `lst` and `lst_sorted` remain unchanged.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list `lst_sorted` contains consecutive integers and is equal to the original list `lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns True if the list is non-empty and contains consecutive integers in any order, or if the list contains a single element; it returns False for an empty list or a list where any two adjacent elements in sorted order are not consecutive
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
