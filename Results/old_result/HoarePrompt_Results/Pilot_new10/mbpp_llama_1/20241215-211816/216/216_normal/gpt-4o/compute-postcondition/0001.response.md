The initial state mentions that `lst` is a list of integers and it is currently empty. However, the provided code snippet does not interact with `lst` in any way. It simply returns `False`.

Given this, we can determine the outcome without considering the state of `lst` because the code does not use or modify `lst`.

Output State: **The program returns False**
