Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The `func_1` function uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the input list `lst`. For each element, it checks if the element is an instance of `int` using the `isinstance(x, int)` function. If an element is an integer, it counts towards the sum; if not, it is skipped.

This approach ensures that the function correctly handles lists containing a mix of integer and non-integer elements, such as strings, floats, and other potential types. The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2`, `assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3`, and `assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2`, demonstrate the function's correctness in various scenarios.

The key to the function's correctness is the use of `isinstance(x, int)`, which precisely identifies integer elements, ignoring other types. This makes the function generally applicable and accurate for its intended purpose as described in the problem description.
