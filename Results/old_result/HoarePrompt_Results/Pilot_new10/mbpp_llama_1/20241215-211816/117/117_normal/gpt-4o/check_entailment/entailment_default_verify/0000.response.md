The original assessment and the provided code align with the problem description, which asks for a function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list. The provided Python function `func_1` accurately utilizes the `isinstance` function to check if each element in the list is an instance of the `int` type and the `sum` function to count the total number of integers. This approach correctly handles lists containing various types of elements and edge cases such as empty lists and lists containing only non-integer elements.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, handling different scenarios including lists with a mix of integers and other types, and even non-hashable types that are instances of some subclass of `int`. Since the `isinstance` function checks for instances of a class or its subclass, the function will correctly count integers that are instances of subclasses of `int` as well.

Given that the provided code matches the problem description and the output hints confirm the expected behavior without revealing any incorrect behavior for the given problem constraints (assuming valid input), the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **True**
