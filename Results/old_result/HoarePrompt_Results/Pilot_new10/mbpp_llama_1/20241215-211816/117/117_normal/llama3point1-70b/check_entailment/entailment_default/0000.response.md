Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`. For each element, it checks if the element is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`, which returns `True` if the element is an integer and `False` otherwise. In Python, `True` is treated as `1` and `False` as `0` when summed, so the `sum` function effectively counts the number of `True` values, which correspond to the number of integers in the list.

This approach correctly handles various edge cases, including:

- Empty lists: The `sum` function will return `0`, which is correct since there are no integers in an empty list.
- Lists with no integers: Again, `sum` will return `0`, accurately reflecting the absence of integers.
- Lists with all integers: Every element will be counted, giving the correct total.
- Lists with mixed data types: Only the integers are counted, ignoring elements of other types.

The output hints agree with this analysis, indicating that the function handles different scenarios correctly. Since we cannot find a case where the program does not work as expected according to the description, the code is deemed correct.
