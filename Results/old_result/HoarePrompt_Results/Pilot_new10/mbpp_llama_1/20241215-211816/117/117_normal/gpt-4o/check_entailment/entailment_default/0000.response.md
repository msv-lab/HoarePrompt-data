Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to count the number of elements in the list `lst` that are instances of `int`. The `isinstance(x, int)` function checks if an element `x` is an instance of `int`. This approach correctly handles various cases, including:
- Empty lists: The `sum` function will return 0 since there are no elements to count.
- Lists with no integers: The `sum` function will return 0 since no elements are instances of `int`.
- Lists with a mix of integers and other types: Only the elements that are instances of `int` are counted.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the function's behavior for different input scenarios. The output hints agree with the code, indicating that the function can handle lists with a mix of integers and other types, including non-hashable types that are instances of some subclass of `int`.

Given the provided information and the nature of the function, it appears to correctly implement the described behavior for all potential cases. Therefore, the code is considered correct according to the problem description.
