Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. It uses a generator expression within the built-in `sum` function to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`. For each element, it checks if the element is an instance of `int` using the `isinstance(x, int)` function. If the element is an integer, it counts as 1; otherwise, it counts as 0. The `sum` function then adds up these counts to give the total number of integer elements in the list.

The function handles various cases correctly, including:

- Empty lists: The function will return 0, as expected, since there are no integer elements.
- Lists with no integers: The function will also return 0, as there are no integer elements to count.
- Lists with a mix of integers and other types: The function correctly identifies and counts only the integer elements, ignoring other types such as strings or floats.
- Lists with non-hashable types that are instances of some subclass of `int`: Although the problem statement mentions handling non-hashable types that are instances of some subclass of `int`, it's worth noting that in Python, `int` is a final class and cannot be subclassed in a way that would produce non-hashable instances. However, if we consider the intention might be to refer to instances of classes that inherit from `int` (which is not directly possible in standard Python), the `isinstance` check would still work correctly for any theoretical subclass of `int` because `isinstance` checks for inheritance.

Given the provided output hints and the functionality of the code, it appears that the function behaves as expected for all potential cases described in the problem description.
