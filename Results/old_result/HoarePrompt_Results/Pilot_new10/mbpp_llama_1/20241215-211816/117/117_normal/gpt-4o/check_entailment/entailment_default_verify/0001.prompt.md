You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3
assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2

def func_1(lst):
    return sum((1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program provided is a Python function named `func_1` that takes a list as an input and returns the number of integer elements in the list. The function uses a generator expression inside the built-in `sum` function to count the number of elements in the list that are instances of the `int` type.

The code works correctly for all potential cases because it correctly identifies and counts integer elements in a list, regardless of the list's composition. It handles lists containing a mix of integers, floats, and strings without any issues. The `isinstance(x, int)` check ensures that only elements that are explicitly integers are counted, excluding other types like floats and strings.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios, including lists with a mix of integers and non-integers, and lists composed entirely of integers. Since the function's logic is sound and it correctly handles all the test cases, as well as any other potential case that can be imagined, it is considered correct.

The logic is straightforward: it iterates through each element `x` in the input list `lst`, checks if `x` is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`, and if so, counts it towards the total sum. This approach ensures that the function accurately counts the integer elements in any given list, fulfilling the problem's requirements.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list and returns the count of elements in the list that are instances of int, handling empty lists, lists with no integers, and lists with a mix of integers and other types, including non-hashable types that are instances of some subclass of int

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
