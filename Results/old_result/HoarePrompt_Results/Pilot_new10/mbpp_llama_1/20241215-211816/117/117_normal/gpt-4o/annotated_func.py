#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))
    #The program returns the count of integers in the list 'lst'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list and returns the count of elements in the list that are instances of int, handling empty lists, lists with no integers, and lists with a mix of integers and other types, including non-hashable types that are instances of some subclass of int
