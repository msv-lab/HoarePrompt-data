#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list that can contain elements of any data type.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)
    #The program returns the count of integers in the list `lst`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list containing elements of any data type and returns the count of integers in the list, handling edge cases such as empty lists, lists with no integers, lists with all integers, and lists with mixed data types correctly.
