The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `sorted_list` and `value`. `sorted_list` is a sorted list of elements, and `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`. After executing the function body, the function returns the index where the `value` should be inserted in `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order. This index is determined by the number of elements in `sorted_list` that are less than or equal to `value`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list and a value, returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, which is the number of elements in the list that are less than or equal to the value.**
