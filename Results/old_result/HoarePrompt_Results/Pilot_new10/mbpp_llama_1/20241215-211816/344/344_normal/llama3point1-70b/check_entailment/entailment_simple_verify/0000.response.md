To assess the correctness of the program, let's break down the information provided:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. This means the function should return the index at which the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list.

2. **Original Assessment**: None. This implies that there was no initial judgment on the correctness of the program.

3. **Program**:
    ```python
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)
    ```

4. **Annotated Code**:
    - The function iterates through the sorted list. When it encounters an element that is greater than or equal to the specified value, it returns the index of that element. This is correct because in a sorted list, this is the point where the value should be inserted to maintain sorted order.
    - If the loop completes without finding such an element, it means the specified value is greater than all elements in the list. In this case, the function correctly returns the length of the list, indicating the value should be appended to the end of the list to maintain sorted order.

Given the problem description and the annotated version of the code, it appears that the program correctly implements the functionality to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The annotations clarify the program's logic and confirm that it behaves as expected for all possible scenarios (i.e., when the value is less than, equal to, or greater than the elements in the sorted list).

The original assessment was "None," meaning there was no initial judgment. However, with the provided annotations and understanding of the program's logic, it's clear that the program does indeed correctly locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.

**Final: True**
