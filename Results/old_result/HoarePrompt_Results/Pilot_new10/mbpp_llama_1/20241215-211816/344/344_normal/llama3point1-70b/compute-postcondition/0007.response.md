According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `sorted_list`. If `i` is less than the length of `sorted_list`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `sorted_list` has at least 2 elements. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. Also, for the loop to execute again, `sorted_list` must have at least 3 elements because `i` is now 2 and it must be less than the length of `sorted_list`.
State: **`sorted_list` is a sorted list with at least 3 elements, `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`, and `i` is 2**
