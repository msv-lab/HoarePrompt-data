Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. This function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list.

The `bisect.bisect_right` function is designed to find the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The function takes into account the case where the value is equal to an existing element in the list and returns the index to the right of the equal element, thus maintaining the sorted order.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correct behavior of the function for different scenarios:

- When the value is larger than all elements in the list (`assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4`).
- When the value is between two elements in the list (`assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2`).
- When the value is larger than all elements in the list again (`assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4`).

Given the functionality of `bisect.bisect_right` and the provided unit tests, the program appears to handle all potential cases correctly, including edge cases such as an empty list or a list with duplicate elements (not explicitly tested but `bisect.bisect_right` is designed to handle these scenarios correctly).

Therefore, based on the analysis and the provided unit tests, the program is correct.
