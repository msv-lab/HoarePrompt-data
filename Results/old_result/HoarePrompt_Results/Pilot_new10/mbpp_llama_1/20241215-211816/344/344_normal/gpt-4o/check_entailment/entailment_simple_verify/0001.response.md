The original assessment was "None", indicating that there was no initial conclusion about the correctness of the program.

Upon reviewing the problem description and the provided code, it appears that the function `func_1` is intended to find the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The code uses the `bisect.bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module, which returns the index where the `value` should be inserted in the `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order.

The annotated version of the code provides additional context and confirms that the program returns the correct index for the specified value.

The provided assertions also support the correctness of the program, as they test different scenarios and expected outputs.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
