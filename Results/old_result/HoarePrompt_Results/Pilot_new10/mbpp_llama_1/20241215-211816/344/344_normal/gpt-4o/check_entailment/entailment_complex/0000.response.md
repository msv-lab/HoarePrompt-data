Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. 

Here's why it's correct:

- The problem description asks for a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. 
- The function `func_1` utilizes the `bisect.bisect_right` function from Python's standard library, which returns the index where the `value` should be inserted in `sorted_list` to maintain the sorted order.
- The function correctly returns the index where the `value` should be inserted, which is the number of elements in `sorted_list` that are less than or equal to `value`. This aligns with the problem description, as inserting the `value` at this index would maintain the sorted order of the list.
- The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) demonstrate the function's correctness for different scenarios, including when the `value` is greater than all elements in the list, when it's equal to an existing element, and when it's between two existing elements.
- The function also correctly handles edge cases, such as an empty list or a `value` outside the range of the list elements, as demonstrated by the `bisect.bisect_right` function's behavior in these scenarios.

In summary, the program correctly implements a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order, meeting the requirements of the problem description.
