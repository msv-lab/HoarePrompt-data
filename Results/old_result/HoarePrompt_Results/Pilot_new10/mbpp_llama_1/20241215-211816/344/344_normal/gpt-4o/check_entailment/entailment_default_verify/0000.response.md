To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the information provided step by step.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that locates the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. This means the function should return the index where the given value can be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list.

2. **Program**: The provided program uses the `bisect` module in Python, specifically the `bisect_right` function. This function returns the insertion point for `value` in `sorted_list` to maintain sorted order. According to the `bisect` module documentation, `bisect_right` returns an insertion point which comes after (to the right of) any existing entries of `value` in `sorted_list`. This matches the problem description's requirement for locating the "right insertion point."

3. **Original Assessment**: There is no original assessment provided, so we'll evaluate the program based solely on the problem description and output hints.

4. **Output Hints**: The output hints describe the functionality of `func_1` accurately. It states that the function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, which is essentially the number of elements in the list that are strictly less than the given value. This is consistent with the behavior of `bisect.bisect_right`.

Considering these points, the program as given does indeed locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list, which aligns with the problem description and the output hints. The `bisect.bisect_right` function is designed to do exactly this, making it a correct and efficient solution to the problem.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness, based on the problem description and the output hints, is that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
