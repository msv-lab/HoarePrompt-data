Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program uses the `bisect` module's `bisect_right` function to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The `bisect_right` function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order of the list.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for different scenarios:

- When the value is greater than all elements in the list, the function returns the length of the list, which is the correct insertion point.
- When the value is between two elements in the list, the function returns the index of the larger element, which is the correct insertion point to maintain the sorted order.
- When the value is greater than the largest element in the list, the function returns the length of the list, which is the correct insertion point.

After analyzing the code and considering various potential cases, it appears that the function works correctly for all possible scenarios, including:

- An empty list: Although not explicitly tested, `bisect.bisect_right` will return 0 for an empty list, which is the correct insertion point for any value.
- A list with duplicate elements: The function will return the index of the first occurrence of the value if it already exists in the list, or the index where it should be inserted if it does not exist.
- A list with negative numbers or zero: The function will work correctly with negative numbers and zero, as the `bisect` module's comparison is based on the numerical values of the elements.

Since no potential case has been found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, the program is considered correct.
