To understand the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's break it down step by step.

1. **Parameters**: The function accepts two parameters: `sorted_list` and `value`. The annotations indicate that `sorted_list` is expected to be a sorted list of elements, and `value` is an element that can be compared with the elements in `sorted_list`.

2. **Return Value**: The function uses `bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)` and returns its result. The `bisect.bisect_right` function returns the index where `value` should be inserted in `sorted_list` to maintain sorted order. This index is equivalent to the number of elements in `sorted_list` that are less than `value`.

3. **Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
    - If `sorted_list` is not sorted, the behavior of `bisect.bisect_right` is undefined, and the result may not be accurate.
    - If `value` is not comparable with the elements in `sorted_list` (for example, if `sorted_list` contains integers and `value` is a string), the function will throw an error.
    - The annotations and return postconditions suggest the function returns the number of elements less than or equal to `value`, but `bisect.bisect_right` actually returns the index where `value` should be inserted to maintain sorted order, which is the number of elements strictly less than `value`.
    - If `sorted_list` is empty, `bisect.bisect_right` will return 0, as there are no elements to compare with `value`.
    - If `value` is less than all elements in `sorted_list`, `bisect.bisect_right` will return 0, indicating `value` should be inserted at the beginning of `sorted_list`.
    - If `value` is greater than or equal to all elements in `sorted_list`, `bisect.bisect_right` will return the length of `sorted_list`, indicating `value` should be inserted at the end of `sorted_list`.

Given these observations, the functionality of `func_1` can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a sorted list and a value, and returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, which is the number of elements in the list that are strictly less than the given value. The function assumes the input list is sorted and the value is comparable with the list elements, and it handles edge cases such as an empty list or a value outside the range of the list elements. **
