The function func_1 accepts two tuples, tuple1 and tuple2, and returns a tuple where each element is the result of a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of tuple1 and tuple2. 

Looking at the code, we can see that it uses the zip function to iterate over corresponding elements of tuple1 and tuple2, and then applies the bitwise AND operator (&) to these elements. 

However, the code does not check if tuple1 and tuple2 have the same length. If they do not, the zip function will stop at the end of the shorter tuple, and the corresponding elements from the longer tuple will be ignored. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two tuples, tuple1 and tuple2, and return a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tuple1 and tuple2, up to the length of the shorter tuple.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two tuples, tuple1 and tuple2, and returns a tuple containing the bitwise AND of corresponding elements from tuple1 and tuple2, up to the length of the shorter tuple, ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple. **
