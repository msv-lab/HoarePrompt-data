The task is to determine whether the given Python program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

The problem description asks for a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples. However, the annotated program defines a function `func_1` that performs a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of `tuple1` and `tuple2`.

To determine if the program is correct, we need to understand what "extract the elementwise and tuples" means. Given the context and the provided unit tests, it seems like the intention is for the function to return a tuple where each element is 1 if the corresponding elements in `tuple1` and `tuple2` are equal, and 0 otherwise. However, the function `func_1` does not perform this operation; instead, it performs a bitwise AND operation.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The bitwise AND operation between two numbers does not determine if they are equal or not; it performs a binary operation on their binary representations.

For example, if `tuple1` is `(1, 2, 3, 4)` and `tuple2` is `(1, 2, 3, 5)`, the function should return `(1, 1, 1, 0)` based on the interpretation that the function should compare the elements for equality. However, the provided function will return `(1, 2, 3, 4)` because `1 & 1 = 1`, `2 & 2 = 2`, `3 & 3 = 3`, and `4 & 5 = 4`.

Correctness: **False**
