Correctness: **True**

The given program is a Python function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone. The formula for the volume of a cone is `(1/3) * π * r^2 * h`, where `r` is the radius of the base and `h` is the height of the cone.

The provided code correctly implements this formula using the `math.pi` constant for π. The function takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume.

The unit tests provided using `assert` statements confirm that the function produces the expected results for different input values. 

There are no cases where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles different input values and calculates the volume of a cone according to the formula. 

Note that this function does not include any error checking to ensure that the input values are valid (e.g., non-negative numbers). However, based on the problem description, the function appears to be designed to calculate the volume of a cone given valid input values, and it does so correctly. 

Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
