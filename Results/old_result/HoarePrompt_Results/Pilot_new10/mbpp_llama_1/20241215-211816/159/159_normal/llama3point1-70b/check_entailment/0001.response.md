Correctness: **True**

The program provided is a function to calculate the volume of a cone. The formula for the volume of a cone is (1/3) * π * r^2 * h, where r is the radius and h is the height. 

The given Python function `func_1(radius, height)` correctly implements this formula using the `math.pi` constant for π and the provided `radius` and `height` parameters. 

It correctly handles all potential cases, including:
- Positive values for radius and height: The function will return the correct volume.
- Zero values for radius or height: The function will return 0, which is the correct volume for a cone with a radius or height of 0.
- Negative values for radius or height: While these are not physically meaningful for the dimensions of a cone, the function will still return a value, although it may be negative. However, according to the standard formula for the volume of a cone, this is mathematically correct.

The function does not handle non-numeric inputs, as it will throw an error if the inputs are not numbers. However, this is not specified in the problem description as a requirement, and the function is correct in the context of calculating the volume of a cone for numeric inputs.

Therefore, based on the provided problem description, the program is correct.
