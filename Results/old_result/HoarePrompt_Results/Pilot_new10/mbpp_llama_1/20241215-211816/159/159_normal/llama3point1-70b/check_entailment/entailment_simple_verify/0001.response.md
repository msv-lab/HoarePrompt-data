The original assessment was "None", which means there was no initial assessment of the program's correctness.

The problem description asks to write a function to find the volume of a cone. The formula for the volume of a cone is indeed 1/3 * π * radius² * height, which is correctly implemented in the provided code.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function takes two non-negative real numbers, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume, which is also a non-negative real number.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I believe the program is correct.

The reason I think the original assessment was not made is that there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. However, after analyzing the code and the annotations, I conclude that the program is indeed correct.

Final: **True**
