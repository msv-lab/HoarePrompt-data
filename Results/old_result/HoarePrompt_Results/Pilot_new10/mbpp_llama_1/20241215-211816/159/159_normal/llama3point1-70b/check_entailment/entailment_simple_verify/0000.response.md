The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. 

The problem description asks to write a function to find the volume of a cone. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cone using the formula `1/3 * π * radius² * height`, which is mathematically correct.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function takes two non-negative real numbers, `radius` and `height`, as input and returns the calculated volume of the cone, which is also a non-negative real number.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the program appears to be correct. The formula used to calculate the volume of the cone is accurate, and the annotations indicate that the function takes valid input and returns the expected result.

Final: **True**
