Correctness: **True**

The code provided does exactly what the problem description says. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers `nums` as input. The function first removes duplicates from the list by converting it to a set and then back to a list, resulting in `unique_nums`. 

If `unique_nums` has less than two distinct elements (i.e., `len(unique_nums) < 2`), the function returns `None`, as per the problem description. Otherwise, it returns the second smallest unique integer from the list by sorting `unique_nums` and indexing the second element (`sorted(unique_nums)[1]`).

This solution covers all potential cases:

1. **Empty list or list with one unique element**: Returns `None` as expected.
2. **List with two or more unique elements**: Correctly identifies the second smallest unique integer.
3. **List with duplicate elements**: Duplicate elements are correctly removed by converting the list to a set, ensuring the function works as intended even with non-unique input lists.

The output hints align with the functionality provided by the code, indicating that the function behaves as expected in the described scenarios. Given the simplicity and correctness of the solution for all potential cases, the code meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
