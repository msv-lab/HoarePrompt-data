To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given Initial State: `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements.

The code snippet is: `unique_nums = list(set(nums))`

This code converts the list `nums` into a set, which automatically removes any duplicate elements because sets in Python can only contain unique elements. It then converts this set back into a list and assigns it to the variable `unique_nums`.

The impact of this code on the program is the creation of a new list, `unique_nums`, which contains all unique integers from the original list `nums`. The order of elements in `unique_nums` may not be the same as in `nums` because sets are unordered in Python.

Given that `nums` has at least two distinct elements, `unique_nums` will also have at least two distinct elements. The length of `unique_nums` will be less than or equal to the length of `nums`, with equality only if all elements in `nums` are distinct.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements, `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers from `nums`, with length less than or equal to the length of `nums`.**
