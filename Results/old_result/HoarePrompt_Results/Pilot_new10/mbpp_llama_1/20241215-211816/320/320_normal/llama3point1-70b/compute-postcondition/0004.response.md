To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet. 

The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements.
- `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers from `nums`.
- The length of `unique_nums` is less than or equal to the length of `nums`.
- The length of `unique_nums` is more than or equal to 2.

The code snippet is: `return sorted(unique_nums)[1]`

This means the program will:
1. Sort the list `unique_nums` in ascending order.
2. Return the second element of the sorted list (since list indices in Python start at 0).

Given that `unique_nums` has at least 2 elements and these elements are unique integers from `nums`, sorting `unique_nums` will arrange these unique integers in ascending order. The second element of this sorted list (`sorted(unique_nums)[1]`) will be the second smallest unique integer from the original list `nums`.

Output State: **The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list `nums`.**
