Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input, removes duplicates by converting the list to a set, sorts the unique numbers in ascending order, and returns the second smallest unique integer if there are at least two unique integers. If there is only one unique integer or the list is empty, it returns `None`.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Removing duplicates**: The program uses the `set` function to remove duplicates from the input list, which ensures that each number is only considered once.
2. **Sorting unique numbers**: The program uses the `sorted` function to sort the unique numbers in ascending order, which allows it to find the second smallest unique integer.
3. **Returning the second smallest unique integer**: The program returns the second smallest unique integer using `unique_nums[1]`, which is the second element in the sorted list of unique numbers.
4. **Handling edge cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases, such as lists with only one unique integer or empty lists, by returning `None`.

The program's correctness is also verified by the provided unit tests, which cover different scenarios, including lists with multiple unique integers, lists with duplicate integers, and lists with only one unique integer.

Overall, the program meets the problem description and correctly finds the second smallest unique integer in a list, making it correct.
