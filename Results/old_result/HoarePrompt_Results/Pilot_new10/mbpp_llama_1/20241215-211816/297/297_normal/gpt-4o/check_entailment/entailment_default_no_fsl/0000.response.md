Correctness: **True**

The provided code is correct and implements the function as described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the input tuple. 

Here's why the code is correct:

1. It handles the case where the input tuple has less than two elements by returning an empty tuple, as specified in the output hints.

2. It uses a generator expression within the `tuple` function to efficiently calculate the products of consecutive numbers in the input tuple.

3. The loop iterates over the indices of the input tuple, excluding the last one, to avoid an `IndexError` when accessing `t[i + 1]`.

4. The output hints and the provided unit tests demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for various input cases, including tuples with different lengths and containing different numbers.

Overall, the code correctly implements the specified functionality and handles all potential cases as described in the problem description and output hints.
