Correctness: **True**.

The given function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple where the i-th element is equal to the product of the i-th and (i+1)-th elements of the input tuple. This is achieved using the `zip` function, which pairs each element in the input tuple with the next one, and a generator expression that multiplies these pairs.

The code works as expected for all potential cases because:

- It correctly handles tuples of any length greater than 1, producing a tuple of length N-1 as required.
- It handles the edge case where the input tuple has only two elements, returning a tuple with one element (the product of the two input numbers).
- It handles the case where the input tuple contains zero or negative numbers correctly, as the operation defined does not depend on the sign or magnitude of the numbers.
- There is no mention of input validation in the problem description, but the code will implicitly expect input to be a tuple of numbers (either integers or floats) and will behave as expected for such inputs.

For example, given the input tuple `(1, 2, 3, 4)`, the function will correctly return `(2, 6, 12)`, which are the products of `(1*2, 2*3, 3*4)` respectively.

Therefore, since the code meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for all potential cases, it is considered correct.
