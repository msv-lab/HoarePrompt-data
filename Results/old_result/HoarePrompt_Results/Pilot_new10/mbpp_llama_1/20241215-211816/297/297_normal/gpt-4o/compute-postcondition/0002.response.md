The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `t` of numbers. According to the annotated code, it returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the input tuple `t`.

Looking at the code, it uses a generator expression to multiply each element `t[i]` by the next element `t[i + 1]` in the tuple, for all indices `i` except the last one (`range(len(t) - 1)`). 

If the input tuple `t` has at least two elements, the function will return a tuple with the products of consecutive numbers as described. However, if the tuple has less than two elements, the function will return an empty tuple, because `range(len(t) - 1)` will be empty.

Therefore, considering all potential cases, the functionality of the function is to accept a tuple of numbers and return a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the input tuple. If the input tuple has less than two elements, it returns an empty tuple.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple of numbers and returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the input tuple. If the input tuple has less than two elements, it returns an empty tuple. **
