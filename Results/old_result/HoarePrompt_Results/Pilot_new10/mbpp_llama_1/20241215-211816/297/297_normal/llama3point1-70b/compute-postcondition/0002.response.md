The function `func_1` accepts a tuple of numbers as input. Based on the code, it returns a tuple containing the products of consecutive elements from the input tuple. 

Looking at the code, we see that it uses the `zip` function with `numbers` and `numbers[1:]` to pair each element with the next one. Then, it uses a generator expression to calculate the product of each pair of consecutive elements. The result is returned as a tuple.

The code does not handle any potential edge cases, such as an empty tuple or a tuple with a single element, explicitly. However, in such cases, the function will not throw an error but will return an empty tuple. This is because the `zip` function will not pair any elements if there is only one element or no elements in the tuple.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to calculate the products of consecutive elements in the input tuple and return them as a tuple. If the input tuple has less than two elements, the function will return an empty tuple.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple of numbers and returns a tuple containing the products of consecutive elements; if the tuple has less than two elements, it returns an empty tuple. **
