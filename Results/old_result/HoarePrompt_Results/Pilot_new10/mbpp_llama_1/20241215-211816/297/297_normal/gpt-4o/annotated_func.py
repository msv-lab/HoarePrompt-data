#State of the program right berfore the function call: t is a tuple of numbers with at least two elements.
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the input tuple `t`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of numbers and returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the input tuple. If the input tuple has less than two elements, it returns an empty tuple.
