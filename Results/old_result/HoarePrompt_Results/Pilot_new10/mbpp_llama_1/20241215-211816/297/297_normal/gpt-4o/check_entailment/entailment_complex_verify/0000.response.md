The original assessment is None, meaning there is no initial assessment of the program's correctness. 

Given the problem description and the provided code, the program seems to be implementing the described functionality correctly. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input and returns a tuple where each element is the product of two consecutive numbers from the input tuple.

The annotated version of the code also confirms this, providing a clear description of the state of the program at different points and explaining how the function works.

Based on the information provided, the program appears to be correct according to the problem description. The provided unit tests also support this conclusion, as they cover various cases and the function returns the expected results.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is: 
Final: **True**
