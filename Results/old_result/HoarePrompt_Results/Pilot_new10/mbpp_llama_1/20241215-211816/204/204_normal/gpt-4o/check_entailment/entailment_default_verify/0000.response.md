The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the provided code and the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not by using a set `months_with_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days. The function then returns `True` if the input month is in the set and `False` otherwise. The months with 31 days are correctly identified as January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).

The output hints provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected. It accepts an integer month between 1 and 12 and returns `True` if the month has 31 days and `False` otherwise.

The unit tests (`assert` statements) also pass, which further confirms that the function behaves as expected for different inputs.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, the output hints, and the original assessment, I believe that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
