The function func_1 accepts an integer parameter month, constrained to the range 1 <= month <= 12. It checks if the month is one of the months with 31 days, which are January, March, May, July, August, October, and December. If the month is one of these, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

Looking at the code, we see that it correctly handles the months with 31 days as specified. However, it's worth noting that the code does not explicitly handle cases where the input month is outside the range of 1 to 12, because the function's behavior in such cases is undefined in the provided annotations. Nonetheless, from the code's perspective, if the input month is outside this range (which it shouldn't be, according to the initial state), the function will still return a boolean value indicating whether that number corresponds to a month with 31 days, based on the set months_with_31_days. Given the constraint provided in the initial state (1 <= month <= 12), this aspect does not affect the functionality within the defined domain.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer month between 1 and 12 and returns True if the month has 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) and False otherwise. **
