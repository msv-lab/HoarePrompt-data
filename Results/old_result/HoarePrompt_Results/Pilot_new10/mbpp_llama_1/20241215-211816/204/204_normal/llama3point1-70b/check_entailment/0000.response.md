Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function uses a list `months_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days, and then checks if the input `n` is in this list.

The list includes all the months that have 31 days in a standard Gregorian calendar: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). 

The function handles all possible inputs correctly:

- If `n` is one of the months with 31 days, it returns `True`.
- If `n` is not one of the months with 31 days, it returns `False`.
- It correctly handles invalid inputs, such as non-integer values or integers outside the range of 1 to 12, as it will simply return `False` in these cases.

Overall, the function works as expected according to the problem description, and there are no cases where it does not work correctly.
