The original assessment makes sense based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not. The function uses a list `months_31_days` to store the month numbers that have 31 days, and then checks if the input `n` is in this list. This approach is straightforward and effective for determining whether a month has 31 days.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function works as expected. It states that the input `n` is an integer between 1 and 12, representing a month of the year, and that the function returns `True` if the month corresponding to `n` has 31 days, and `False` otherwise.

The original assessment correctly notes that the function handles all possible inputs correctly, returning `True` for months with 31 days and `False` for months without 31 days. The assessment also correctly points out that the function will return `False` for invalid inputs, such as non-integer values or integers outside the range of 1 to 12.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The function correctly implements the desired behavior and handles all possible inputs correctly.

Final: **True**
