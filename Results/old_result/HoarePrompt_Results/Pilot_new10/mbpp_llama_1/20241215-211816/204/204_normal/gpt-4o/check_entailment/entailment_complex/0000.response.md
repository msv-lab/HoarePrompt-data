Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

- The program defines a set `months_with_31_days` that contains the month numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) corresponding to the months that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December).
- The function `func_1` checks if the input `month` is in the `months_with_31_days` set. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days. Otherwise, it returns `False`.
- The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) validate the function's behavior for different months, ensuring that it correctly identifies months with 31 days and those without.
- The function's design ensures that it will work correctly for all possible input values of `month` (from 1 to 12), because it directly checks for membership in the predefined set of months with 31 days.

Overall, the program meets the problem description by accurately identifying months with 31 days and returning the correct result for every potential case.
