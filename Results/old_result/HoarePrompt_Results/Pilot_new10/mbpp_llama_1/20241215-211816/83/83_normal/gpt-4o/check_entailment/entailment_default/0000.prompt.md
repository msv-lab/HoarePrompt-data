You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

I am giving you some examples to understand the task better. Then I am giving you your task.
# Example 1

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.


Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_divisible(number1, number2):
    if number1 % number2 == 0:
        return True
''' 

Output hints for function1:  The function accepts 2 numbers as input, if number 1 is divisible than number2 then the function returns True.
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def is_not_prime(n):
    if n < 2:
        return True
    for i in range(2, n):
        if is_divisible(n,i):
            return True
    return False
''' 

Output hints for function 2:  The function returns True if n is less than 2 or if n is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False.

Example Answer 1:
Explanation: The program initially seems to do what the description says. Lets see if the hints also agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the program is incorrect. The output hints seem to agree with the program code and from their contents they reenforce our reasoning that the code is correct.
The function returns True if `n` is less than 2 or if `n` is divisible by any integer in the range [2, n). Otherwise, it returns False. Since the smallest prime number is 2 and prime numbers can only be divided by 1 and themselves, this approach correctly identifies non-prime numbers as per the given specification. 

Correctness: **True**.

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a python function to count all the substrings starting and ending with same characters.
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
```
def count_Substring_With_Equal_Ends(s):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(s)-1):
        for j in range(i,len(s)-1):
            if s[i] == s[j+1]:
                count += 1
    return count
```

Output hints for function number 1 : The function returns the value of the variable 'count', which is equal to the number of times a character at position 'i' in the string 's' is equal to a character at position 'j + 1' for some 'j' in the range '[i, len(s) - 2]'. This implies that 'count' represents the number of consecutive occurrences of identical characters in the string 's' that may form a substring with equal ending and beginning characters, excluding the last character of the string from this comparison.

Example Answer 2:
Explanation: The function initially seems to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and if they give us any reason to think the code is incorrec. Indeed they agree with the code and they show that the code might not always follow the program description. The function returns the value of the variable `count`, which is equal to the number of times a character at position `i` in the string `s` is equal to a character at position `j + 1` for some `j` in the range `[i, len(s) - 2]`. This does not account for substrings of length 1, so it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.


# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to find the minimum number of rotations (greater than 0) required to get the same string.

Functions with output hints for each function:
Function nummber 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def get_list_size(list):
    return len(list)
''' 

Output hint for function1:  The function accepts a string and returns the size of that string
Function nummber 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_Rotations(str1):
    n = get_list_size(str1)
    for i in range(1,n+1):
        if str1[i:] + str1[:i] == str1:
            return i
''' 

Output hint for function 2: If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value and the variable n remains unchanged, holding the length of the string str1. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer i such that 0 < i < n, where n is the length of the string str1, and i represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. If no such rotation exists, then the function does not return a value.

Example Answer 3:
Explanation: The code initially does not seem to be correct. Lets see if the output hints agree with the code and reenforce our belief that the code is incorrect. The hints do seem to agree with the code and they also show that the code does not always follow the program description. If the string is a palindrome, the function does not return a value, and the variable `n` remains unchanged, holding the length of the string `str1`. This behavior is correct as the specification states that the rotation count must be greater than 0. If the string is not a palindrome, then the function returns an integer `i` such that `0 < i < n`, where `n` is the length of the string `str1`. The value `i` represents the length of the shortest non-empty rotation of str1 to return to its original state.. However, the code iterates from `1` to `n-1`, meaning it does not include `n`. This omission is problematic because it fails to check the complete rotation case, where `i` could be equal to `n`. Consequently, the function does not meet the specification as it should return the rotation count up to `n` times. Therefore, it does not meet the specification.

Correctness: **False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Functions with output description for each function:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(arr):


    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
    return arr
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts an ordered list `arr` and returns the list in descending order by iteratively finding the maximum element in the unsorted part of the list and swapping it with the last element of the unsorted part, handling edge cases such as empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with duplicate elements, but assuming that the input list is ordered and that the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are defined and accessible.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        (arr[start], arr[end]) = (arr[end], arr[start])
        start += 1
        end -= 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `flip` modifies the original list `arr` by reversing the elements from the start of the list to the index specified by the `end` parameter, but does not return anything; it handles cases where `end` is within the valid range, but may not work as expected for invalid inputs, and does not handle cases where `end` is not a non-negative integer or is out of range.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  To determine the functionality of the given function, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Parameters and Variables**: The function is defined as `find_max_index(n)`, indicating it accepts one parameter `n`. However, within the function, it references a list `arr`, which is not passed as a parameter but is assumed to be accessible. This implies `arr` is either a global variable or is somehow passed implicitly, not through the function's parameters.

2. **Functionality**: The function iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `arr` (from index 0 to `n-1`), comparing each element to the current maximum found so far. If an element is greater than the current maximum, the function updates the `max_index` to the index of this new maximum element. After iterating through all `n` elements, the function returns the index of the maximum element found.

3. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
    - The function does not handle the case where `n` is 0. In such a scenario, the `for` loop will not execute because `range(1, 0)` is empty, and the function will return `0` without any comparison, which might not be the intended behavior if the list is empty or if `n` equals 0.
    - The function assumes that `arr` has at least `n` elements. If `n` is greater than the length of `arr`, the function will not throw an error but will only consider the elements up to the length of `arr`, because it uses `range(1, n)` and only accesses `arr[i]` within this range. However, the annotation suggests that `n` should be such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`, implying this case should be handled or considered valid.
    - The annotations and return postconditions do not address what happens if all elements in the subarray are equal. The function will return `0` in this case, as it initializes `max_index` to `0` and only updates it if a greater element is found.

4. **Potential Issues with Annotations**: The annotations and return postconditions are generally consistent with the code's behavior, except for the implicit assumption about `arr` and the lack of discussion on edge cases like `n` being 0 or `n` exceeding the length of `arr`.

**Functionality**: **The function finds the index of the maximum element in a subarray of length `n` from a list `arr`, returning this index. It assumes `arr` is accessible and `n` is within the bounds of `arr`'s length. The function handles the general case but has edge cases for when `n` is 0 or potentially exceeds `arr`'s length, in which scenarios its behavior is either undefined by the annotations or implicitly defined by the code's behavior.**



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
