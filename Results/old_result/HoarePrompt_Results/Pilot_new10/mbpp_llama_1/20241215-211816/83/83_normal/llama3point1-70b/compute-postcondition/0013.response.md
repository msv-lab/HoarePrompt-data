The given code `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` reverses the elements of `arr` from index 0 to `size-1`. 
Given that `size` is equal to `n-1`, the elements of `arr` from index 0 to `n-2` are reversed. 
Since `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, and `size` is `n-1`, all elements of `arr` except the last one are reversed.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element where all elements except the last one are reversed, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is equal to `n-1`. The index of the maximum value in the reversed part of `arr` excluding the last element of `arr` needs to be recalculated.**
