The code updates the `max_index` variable to be equal to `i`. Given that `i` is 3, `max_index` will now be 3, regardless of the previous comparison between `arr[i]` and `arr[max_index]`. The other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer greater than 3 and such that `3 < n <= len(arr)`, `i` is 3, `max_index` is 3**
