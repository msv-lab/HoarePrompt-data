Given the code snippet `max_index = i`, we need to analyze its impact on the initial state.

Initial State: `arr` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and such that `1 < n <= len(arr)`, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 1. The current value of `arr[i]` is greater than the current value of `arr[max_index]`.

Since `max_index` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1, the new value of `max_index` becomes 1.

The other variables (`arr`, `n`, `i`) remain unchanged, as the code snippet only affects the value of `max_index`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer greater than 1 and such that `1 < n <= len(arr)`, `max_index` is 1, `i` is 1**
