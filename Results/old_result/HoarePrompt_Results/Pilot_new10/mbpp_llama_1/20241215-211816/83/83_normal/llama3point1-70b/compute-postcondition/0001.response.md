According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The loop iterates over the range from `n` down to 1, so `n` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `arr` is a list of elements and `n` is the number of elements in `arr`, which implies that `arr` has `n` elements.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`**
