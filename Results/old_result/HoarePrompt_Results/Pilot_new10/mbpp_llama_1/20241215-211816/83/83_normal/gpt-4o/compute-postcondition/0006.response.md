The code assigns the value of `i` to `max_index`. Since `i` is 2, `max_index` is assigned the value 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and such that `2 < n <= len(arr)`, `i` is 2, `max_index` is 2**
