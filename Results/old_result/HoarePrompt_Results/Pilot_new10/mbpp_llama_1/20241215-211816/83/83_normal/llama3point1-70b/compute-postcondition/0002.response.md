The value of `max_index` is assigned the index of the maximum element in the list `arr` up to the `size` index. Since `size` is equal to `n`, which is the number of elements in `arr`, the maximum element is found in the entire list `arr`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that must have at least 1 element, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr`.**
