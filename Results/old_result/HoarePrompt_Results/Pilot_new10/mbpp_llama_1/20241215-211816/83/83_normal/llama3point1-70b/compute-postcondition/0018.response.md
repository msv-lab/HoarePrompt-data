Postcondition: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is 2. If `max_index` is not 0, the first two elements of `arr` are swapped. In any case, if `max_index` is 0, `arr[0]` remains the same, which means `arr[0]` will be the maximum of the original `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`, and `arr[1]` will be the minimum of the original `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`.**
