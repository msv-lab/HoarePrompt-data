The given code reverses the order of the first `size` elements in the list `arr`. Since `size` is 2, this means the first two elements of `arr` are swapped. 

If `max_index` is not 0, the first two elements of `arr` were already swapped before this operation. So, after the given code is executed, the first two elements of `arr` will be in their original order. 

If `max_index` is 0, the first two elements of `arr` were not swapped before this operation. In this case, after the given code is executed, `arr[0]` will be the original `arr[1]` and `arr[1]` will be the original `arr[0]`. 

However, according to the initial state, if `max_index` is 0, `arr[0]` should be the maximum of the original `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`, and `arr[1]` should be the minimum of the original `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`. This condition is overridden by the actual swapping that occurs due to the code.

Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is 2. The first two elements of `arr` are swapped, regardless of the original value of `max_index`. If `max_index` is not 0, `arr` is in its original state except for the swapping that occurred before the given code was executed, which is now reversed. If `max_index` is 0, the original `arr[0]` and `arr[1]` are swapped.

However, taking into account the rules for `max_index`, we can conclude that if `max_index` is 0, then after the initial swapping, `arr[0]` is the maximum of the original `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`, and `arr[1]` is the minimum of the original `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`. After the given code is executed, `arr[0]` will be the minimum of the original `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`, and `arr[1]` will be the maximum of the original `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`. If `max_index` is not 0, then the first two elements of `arr` were already swapped, and the given code will swap them back to their original order.

So, the output state should reflect the changes in `arr` based on the initial state and the given code. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is 2. If `max_index` is 0, `arr[0]` is the minimum of the original `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`, and `arr[1]` is the maximum of the original `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`. If `max_index` is not 0, the first two elements of `arr` are in their original order.**
