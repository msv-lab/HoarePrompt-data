You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements that can be ordered, the function find_max_index and flip are defined and accessible within the scope of func_1, and they operate on arr.
def func_1(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements in descending order, `n` is the original number of elements in `arr`, `find_max_index` and `flip` are defined and accessible, `curr_size` is 2
    return arr
    #The program returns a list 'arr' that contains elements in descending order, with 'n' as the original number of elements in 'arr', and 'curr_size' is 2

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, end is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= end < len(arr).
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        
        start += 1
        
        end -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: The elements of `arr` from the original `start` index to the original `end` index are reversed, `start` is equal to the original value of `end`, and `end` is equal to the original value of `start`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of elements, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(arr).
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `arr` is a list of elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the subarray `arr[0:n]`.
    return max_index
    #The program returns the index of the maximum element in the subarray arr[0:n], which is an integer between 0 and n-1.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
