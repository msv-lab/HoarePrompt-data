Correctness: **False**.

The provided code is attempting to implement a sorting algorithm, specifically a variant of the pancake sort. However, there are several issues that make the program incorrect.

1. The `arr` variable is used in multiple functions, but it is not defined as a global variable or passed as an argument to the functions. This will cause a `NameError` when the functions are called.

2. The `find_max_index` function is called with an argument `curr_size`, but it is not used correctly inside the function. The function should find the index of the maximum element in the subarray from index 0 to `curr_size - 1`, but the provided implementation does not consider the `curr_size` argument.

3. The `func_1` function does not correctly implement the pancake sort algorithm. The algorithm should repeatedly find the maximum unsorted element and flip it to the end of the unsorted portion of the array, but the provided implementation does not correctly implement this step.

4. The `flip` function is not correctly implemented. It is trying to flip the elements of the array from the start to the end index, but it does not correctly swap the elements.

Here's an example where the program does not work correctly:

* Input: `arr = [3, 2, 1]`
* Expected output: `[1, 2, 3]`
* Actual output: `NameError` because `arr` is not defined in the `find_max_index` function.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be corrected to properly implement the pancake sort algorithm and handle the array correctly. Additionally, the `arr` variable should be passed as an argument to the functions or defined as a global variable. 

Here is an example of how the corrected code could look like:

```python
def pancake_sort(arr):
    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(arr, curr_size)
        if max_index!= curr_size - 1:
            flip(arr, max_index)
            flip(arr, curr_size - 1)
    return arr

def flip(arr, end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        arr[start], arr[end] = arr[end], arr[start]
        start += 1
        end -= 1

def find_max_index(arr, n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index

arr = [3, 2, 1]
print(pancake_sort(arr))  # Output: [1, 2, 3]
```
