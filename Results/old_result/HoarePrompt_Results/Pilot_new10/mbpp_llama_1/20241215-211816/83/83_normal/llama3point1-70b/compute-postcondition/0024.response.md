To determine the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's break down its components and the operations it performs on the input list `arr`.

1. **Input and Initialization**: The function accepts a list `arr` as its input. It calculates the length of the list `arr` and assigns it to `n`.

2. **Loop and Sorting Logic**: It then enters a loop that runs from `n` down to 1. In each iteration of the loop, it finds the maximum element in the unsorted part of the list (`arr[:size]`), and if this maximum element is not at the end of the unsorted part, it performs two reversal operations to move the maximum element to the end of the unsorted part. 

    - The first reversal is from the beginning of the list up to and including the index of the maximum element (`arr[:max_index + 1] = arr[:max_index + 1][::-1]`). This operation is conditional on `max_index` not being 0, to avoid unnecessary operations.
    
    - The second reversal is over the entire unsorted part of the list (`arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]`). This operation effectively moves the maximum element found in the unsorted part to the end of the unsorted section.

3. **Return Statement**: After the loop completes, the function returns the list `arr`, which is now sorted in descending order.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**:
    - **Empty List**: If `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute (`range(n, 0, -1)` would be `range(0, 0, -1)`, which is empty), and the function returns an empty list, which is the correct result for sorting an empty list.
    
    - **List with One Element**: If `arr` contains only one element, the loop runs once but given the conditionals inside, no reversal operations are performed, and the function correctly returns the original list (which is already sorted).

Given this breakdown, the functionality of the function `func_1` is accurately described by its return postcondition but also includes inherent handling of edge cases like empty lists or lists with a single element.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of elements, sorts it in descending order using a variant of the pancake sort algorithm, and returns the sorted list. It correctly handles edge cases, including empty lists and lists containing a single element, returning them as is since they are already sorted. **
