The given code reverses the elements in `arr` up to `max_index + 1`. The value of `max_index` is the index of the maximum value between `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`. Since `arr` has at least 1 element, `max_index` can be either 0 or 1.

If `max_index` is 0, the maximum value is at index 0, and `arr[0]` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`. Reversing `arr[:max_index + 1]` means reversing `arr[:1]`, which is `arr[0]`. This doesn't change `arr[0]` because it's a single element.

If `max_index` is 1, the maximum value is at index 1, and `arr[1]` is the maximum of `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`. Reversing `arr[:max_index + 1]` means reversing `arr[:2]`, which swaps `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `size` is 2, `arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element where the first `max_index + 1` elements are reversed. If `max_index` is 0, then `arr[0]` remains the same. If `max_index` is 1, then `arr[0]` and `arr[1]` are swapped. The value of `max_index` itself doesn't change because it still refers to the index of the maximum value between the original `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`, which after the reversal could be at index 0 if the maximum was originally at index 1 and vice versa.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `size` is 2, `arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element where if `max_index` is 0 then `arr[0]` remains the same, if `max_index` is 1 then the first two elements of `arr` are swapped**
