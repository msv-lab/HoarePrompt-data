The code initializes a new variable `max_index` and assigns it the value 0. The initial state variables `arr` and `n` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, `arr` remains a list of elements, and `n` remains a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(arr). 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(arr), `max_index` is 0**
