Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `n` is the number of elements in `arr` and is greater than 0, `size` is 2. If `max_index` is not equal to `size - 1` (which is 1), and `max_index` is 0, then `arr[0]` is the minimum of the original `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`, and `arr[1]` is the maximum of the original `arr[0]` and `arr[1]`. If `max_index` is not 0 (i.e., `max_index` is 1), the first two elements of `arr` remain in their original order. If `max_index` equals `size - 1` (which is 1), then the first two elements of `arr` remain unchanged.***
