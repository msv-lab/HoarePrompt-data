You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort a list of elements.
Functions with output description for each function:
assert func_1([15, 79, 25, 38, 69]) == [15, 25, 38, 69, 79]
assert func_1([98, 12, 54, 36, 85]) == [12, 36, 54, 85, 98]
assert func_1([41, 42, 32, 12, 23]) == [12, 23, 32, 41, 42]

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(arr):


    n = len(arr)
    for curr_size in range(n, 1, -1):
        max_index = find_max_index(curr_size)
        if max_index != curr_size - 1:
            flip(max_index)
            flip(curr_size - 1)
    return arr
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts an ordered list `arr` and returns the list in descending order by iteratively finding the maximum element in the unsorted part of the list and swapping it with the last element of the unsorted part, handling edge cases such as empty lists, single-element lists, and lists with duplicate elements, but assuming that the input list is ordered and that the `find_max_index` and `flip` functions are defined and accessible.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def flip(end):
    start = 0
    while start < end:
        (arr[start], arr[end]) = (arr[end], arr[start])
        start += 1
        end -= 1
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function `flip` modifies the original list `arr` by reversing the elements from the start of the list to the index specified by the `end` parameter, but does not return anything; it handles cases where `end` is within the valid range, but may not work as expected for invalid inputs, and does not handle cases where `end` is not a non-negative integer or is out of range.
Function number 3 :
 Code:
 '''
def find_max_index(n):
    max_index = 0
    for i in range(1, n):
        if arr[i] > arr[max_index]:
            max_index = i
    return max_index
''' 

 Output hints for function3:  To determine the functionality of the given function, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Parameters and Variables**: The function is defined as `find_max_index(n)`, indicating it accepts one parameter `n`. However, within the function, it references a list `arr`, which is not passed as a parameter but is assumed to be accessible. This implies `arr` is either a global variable or is somehow passed implicitly, not through the function's parameters.

2. **Functionality**: The function iterates through the first `n` elements of the list `arr` (from index 0 to `n-1`), comparing each element to the current maximum found so far. If an element is greater than the current maximum, the function updates the `max_index` to the index of this new maximum element. After iterating through all `n` elements, the function returns the index of the maximum element found.

3. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
    - The function does not handle the case where `n` is 0. In such a scenario, the `for` loop will not execute because `range(1, 0)` is empty, and the function will return `0` without any comparison, which might not be the intended behavior if the list is empty or if `n` equals 0.
    - The function assumes that `arr` has at least `n` elements. If `n` is greater than the length of `arr`, the function will not throw an error but will only consider the elements up to the length of `arr`, because it uses `range(1, n)` and only accesses `arr[i]` within this range. However, the annotation suggests that `n` should be such that `0 <= n <= len(arr)`, implying this case should be handled or considered valid.
    - The annotations and return postconditions do not address what happens if all elements in the subarray are equal. The function will return `0` in this case, as it initializes `max_index` to `0` and only updates it if a greater element is found.

4. **Potential Issues with Annotations**: The annotations and return postconditions are generally consistent with the code's behavior, except for the implicit assumption about `arr` and the lack of discussion on edge cases like `n` being 0 or `n` exceeding the length of `arr`.

**Functionality**: **The function finds the index of the maximum element in a subarray of length `n` from a list `arr`, returning this index. It assumes `arr` is accessible and `n` is within the bounds of `arr`'s length. The function handles the general case but has edge cases for when `n` is 0 or potentially exceeds `arr`'s length, in which scenarios its behavior is either undefined by the annotations or implicitly defined by the code's behavior.**



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
