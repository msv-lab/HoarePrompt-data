The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. 

Based on the problem description, which is to find the shared elements from two given lists, and the provided code, the function `func_1` takes two parameters, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2`, and returns a tuple containing the elements common to both lists, with no duplicate elements.

The annotated version of the code provides additional information about the state of the program. It states that before the function call, `test_tup1` and `test_tup2` are lists, and after the function call, the program returns a tuple containing the common elements of both lists with no duplicates.

The provided code seems to be correct based on the problem description. It uses the set intersection operation `&` to find the common elements between the two lists and then converts the result back to a tuple. 

However, there is a discrepancy between the variable names (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) and the type of the variables (lists). The variable names suggest that the variables should be tuples, but the annotated code and the problem description state that they are lists. 

Despite this discrepancy, the code will work correctly for lists, because the code is treating the inputs as iterable collections, which both lists and tuples are.

Final: **True**
