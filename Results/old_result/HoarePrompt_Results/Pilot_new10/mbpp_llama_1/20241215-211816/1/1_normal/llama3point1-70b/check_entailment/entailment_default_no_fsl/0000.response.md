Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to be correct as it successfully finds the shared elements from two given lists (tuples in this case) and returns them as a tuple. The function uses Python's set operations to achieve this. 

Here's why it works:
- The `set()` function is used to convert the input tuples into sets, which automatically removes any duplicate elements within each tuple.
- The `&` operator is then used to find the intersection of the two sets, which gives a new set containing only the elements common to both.
- Finally, the `tuple()` function is used to convert this resulting set back into a tuple, which is then returned by the function.

The output hints also seem to match the code's behavior:
- If there are no common elements or if either input is empty, the function will indeed return an empty tuple, because the intersection of two sets with no common elements (or an empty set and any other set) is an empty set.
- If the inputs are not iterables, the function will indeed throw an error, because both `set()` and `tuple()` require iterable inputs.

Overall, the code appears to correctly implement the problem description for every potential case. It handles the case of no common elements, empty inputs, and potential errors when the inputs are not iterables.
