Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two lists as input and returns a tuple of common elements between the two lists in ascending order.

Here's why it works:

1. The `set(list1) & set(list2)` expression finds the intersection of the two sets, which gives us the common elements between the two lists.
2. The `sorted(common_elements)` function sorts the common elements in ascending order.
3. The `tuple(...)` function converts the sorted list into a tuple, which is then returned by the function.

The program handles all potential cases correctly:

* If there are no common elements between the two lists, the function returns an empty tuple.
* If there are duplicate elements in the lists, the function only returns each common element once, because sets automatically eliminate duplicates.
* If the lists are in any order, the function sorts the common elements correctly.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function works correctly in different scenarios.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description, and its correctness is verified by the provided unit tests and the explanation above.
