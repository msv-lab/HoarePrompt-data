The original assessment is "None", which means there is no prior assessment of the program's correctness. The problem description asks for a function to find the shared elements from two given lists. 

Upon examining the provided code, it appears to be correct. The function `func_1` takes two lists as input, converts them to sets, finds their intersection using the `&` operator, and returns the common elements as a tuple in ascending order.

The annotated version of the code confirms this understanding. The annotation states that the program returns a tuple of common elements between `list1` and `list2`, in ascending order, which aligns with the problem description.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, I believe the program is correct.

Final: **True**
