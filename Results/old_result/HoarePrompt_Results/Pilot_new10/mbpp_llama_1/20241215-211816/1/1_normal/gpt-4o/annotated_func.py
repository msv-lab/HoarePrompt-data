#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists.
def func_1(list1, list2):
    common_elements = set(list1) & set(list2)
    return tuple(sorted(common_elements))
    #The program returns a tuple of common elements between list1 and list2, in ascending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a tuple of common elements between them in ascending order. If there are no common elements, it returns an empty tuple. The function assumes that the elements in the lists are hashable and comparable, and may raise a TypeError if this is not the case.
