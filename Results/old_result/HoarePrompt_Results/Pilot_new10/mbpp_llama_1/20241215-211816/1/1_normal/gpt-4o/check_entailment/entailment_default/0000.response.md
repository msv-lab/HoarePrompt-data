Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a tuple of common elements between them in ascending order. If there are no common elements, it returns an empty tuple.

The code uses the set intersection operation (`set(list1) & set(list2)`) to find the common elements between the two lists, and then converts the resulting set to a tuple and sorts it in ascending order using the `sorted` function.

The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function returns a tuple of common elements between the two lists in ascending order. The hints also mention that the function assumes that the elements in the lists are hashable and comparable, which is a valid assumption given that the code uses sets and sorting.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the correctness of the function for various input cases, including cases with multiple common elements, cases with no common elements, and cases with duplicate elements in the input lists.

After reviewing the code and the output hints, I could not find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code correctly handles cases with duplicate elements, empty lists, and lists with different lengths. Additionally, the code raises a TypeError if the elements in the lists are not hashable and comparable, which is a reasonable behavior given the problem constraints.

Overall, the code appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
