Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle every potential case as described in the problem description. The Output hints mention that the function assumes the input list only contains integers and does not handle non-integer values or null inputs explicitly. If the input list contains non-integer values, such as floats or strings, or if the input is null, the function could lead to errors. For example, if the input is `[1, 2, '3', 4, 5]`, the function will throw an error when it tries to calculate `num % 2` for the string '3'. Another case is when the input is `None`, the function will throw an error when it tries to iterate over `None`.

To make the function correct, it should include error handling to check the type of the input and its elements, and either filter out non-integer values or throw a meaningful error message. 

For instance, the function could be modified to handle non-integer values as follows:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    if not isinstance(numbers, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")
    return [num for num in numbers if isinstance(num, int) and num % 2 == 0]
```
This modified function will correctly handle lists containing non-integer values by filtering them out, and will throw an error if the input is not a list.
