#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even integers from the 'numbers' list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, filters out the even integers, and returns them in a new list. If the input list is empty or contains no even integers, it returns an empty list. The function assumes the input list only contains integers and does not handle non-integer values or null inputs explicitly, which could lead to errors in such cases.
