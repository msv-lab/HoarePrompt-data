#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    return [num for num in numbers if num % 2 == 0]
    #The program returns a list of even integers from the list 'numbers'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers, returns a list of even integers from the input list, and handles empty lists by returning an empty list, but may throw an error or behave unexpectedly if the input is not a list or if the list contains non-integer values.
