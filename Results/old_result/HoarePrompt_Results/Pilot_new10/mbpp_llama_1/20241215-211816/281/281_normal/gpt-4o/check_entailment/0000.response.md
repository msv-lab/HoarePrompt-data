Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns all even numbers from a given list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate through each number in the input list and checks if the number is even by using the modulo operator (`num % 2 == 0`). If the number is even, it is included in the output list.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Empty lists: The function will return an empty list, which is the expected output for an empty input list.
* Lists with only odd numbers: The function will return an empty list, which is the expected output for a list with no even numbers.
* Lists with only even numbers: The function will return the input list, which is the expected output for a list with only even numbers.
* Lists with a mix of odd and even numbers: The function will return a list of only the even numbers, which is the expected output for a list with a mix of odd and even numbers.
* Lists with zero: The function will correctly identify zero as an even number and include it in the output list.

Overall, the function is correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
