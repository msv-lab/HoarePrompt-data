Correctness: **True**

The given Python program meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

- The problem description asks for a function to find even numbers from a list of numbers.
- The provided function, `func_1`, accepts a list of integers as input and uses a list comprehension to filter out the even numbers.
- It correctly identifies even numbers by using the condition `num % 2 == 0`, which is a standard way to check if a number is even.
- The function returns a list of even integers from the input list, which aligns with the problem description.
- The function also handles empty lists correctly by returning an empty list, as demonstrated by the list comprehension's behavior when the input list is empty.

However, it's worth noting that the function may throw an error or behave unexpectedly if the input is not a list or if the list contains non-integer values, as mentioned in the annotation. But based on the problem description alone, which does not specify what should happen in these cases, the function meets the requirements.

To make the function fully robust, you might consider adding error checking code to handle non-list inputs and non-integer values within the list. For example:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    if not isinstance(numbers, list):
        raise TypeError("Input must be a list")
    return [num for num in numbers if isinstance(num, int) and num % 2 == 0]
```

This modified version of the function includes a check to ensure the input is a list and only attempts to filter integers from the list, skipping any non-integer values.
