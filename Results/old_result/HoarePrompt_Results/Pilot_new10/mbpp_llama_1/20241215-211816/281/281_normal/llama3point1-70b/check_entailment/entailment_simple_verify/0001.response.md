To determine the correctness of the program, we need to check if it meets the problem description's requirements.

The problem description asks to write a Python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input and returns a list of numbers for which `num % 2 == 0`, which is the condition for a number to be even.

The original assessment is "None", indicating no prior evaluation of the program's correctness.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function is designed to return a list of even integers from the input list 'numbers'. Given that the input to the program is assumed to be valid (i.e., a list of integers), the function should work as expected.

Based on the information provided:
- The program correctly implements a function to filter even numbers from a list.
- The annotations support the understanding that the function is intended to and does return even numbers.
- There is no indication from the problem description or the annotated code that the program should handle invalid inputs or edge cases (like empty lists or non-integer values), and it is assumed that the user will always provide a valid input.

Therefore, considering the problem description and the annotated code, the original assessment's absence does not impact the evaluation since we are directly assessing the program's correctness based on the provided information.

Final: **True**
