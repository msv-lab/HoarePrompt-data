The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness.

Given the problem description, which is to write a Python function to find even numbers from a list of numbers, and the provided code, the function `func_1` seems to correctly implement this functionality. It uses a list comprehension to filter out numbers that are not even (i.e., `num % 2!= 0`) and returns a list of even numbers.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for valid inputs (a list of integers) and handles edge cases like empty lists correctly by returning an empty list. However, they also highlight potential issues if the input is not a list or contains non-integer values, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

Despite these potential issues, given the assumption that the input will always be valid (a non-empty list of integers), the function `func_1` correctly implements the required functionality based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
