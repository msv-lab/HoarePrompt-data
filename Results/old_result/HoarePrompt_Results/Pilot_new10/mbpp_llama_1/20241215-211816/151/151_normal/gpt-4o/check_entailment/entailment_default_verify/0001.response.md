The original assessment is None, which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. The problem description asks for a function to flatten a given nested list structure. The provided code implements a recursive function `func_1` that handles nested lists of arbitrary depth, flattening them into a single list of integers.

The code provided is correct based on the problem description. It handles lists containing integers and/or other lists, potentially nested to any depth, and returns a flattened version of this list. The function `func_1` recursively calls itself for each sublist it encounters, effectively flattening the input list.

The output hints further support the correctness of the program, stating that the function accepts a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and returns a flattened version of this list. This is consistent with the problem description and the provided code.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, I conclude that the original assessment was a non-evaluation, but the program itself is correct.

Final: **True**
