The original assessment is "None", which means that no assessment was made. Based on the problem description and the provided code, it appears that the program is correct.

The problem description asks for a function to flatten a given nested list structure, and the provided code does exactly that. The function `func_1` takes a nested list as input and returns a flat list. The code uses recursion to handle nested lists of any depth.

The annotated version of the code also confirms that the program is correct. The annotations describe the state of the program before and after the function call, and they match the expected behavior of the function.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
