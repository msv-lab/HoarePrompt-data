Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened list. The function uses recursion to handle nested lists of arbitrary depth.

Here's why I think the code is correct:

1. The function checks each element in the input list to determine if it's a list or not.
2. If an element is a list, the function calls itself with that element as the new input list, effectively flattening the nested list.
3. If an element is not a list, it's appended to the `flat_list`.
4. The function returns the `flat_list`, which contains all the elements from the original nested list, but in a flattened structure.

I've considered various potential cases, such as:

* An empty input list: The function returns an empty list, which is correct.
* A list with only one element: The function returns a list with that single element, which is correct.
* A list with multiple elements, including nested lists: The function correctly flattens the nested lists and returns a single list with all the elements.
* A list with deeply nested lists: The function's recursive approach allows it to handle lists of arbitrary depth.

Since I couldn't find any cases where the program doesn't work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.
