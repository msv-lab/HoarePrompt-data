The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which can be a list containing integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth. 

Upon analyzing the code line by line, it appears that the function recursively flattens the `nested_list`. If an item in the list is a list itself, the function calls itself with this sublist; if the item is not a list, it is appended to the `flat_list`.

The code handles the case where the input list is empty, as the for loop will simply not execute in this case, and an empty list will be returned.

However, the code does not check the type of the input. If the input is not a list, the function may throw an error when trying to iterate over it. 

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the list contains non-integer and non-list elements. In this case, these elements will be appended to the `flat_list` without any issues.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and return a flattened version of this list. The function will work with lists containing non-integer and non-list elements, but may throw an error if the input is not a list.
