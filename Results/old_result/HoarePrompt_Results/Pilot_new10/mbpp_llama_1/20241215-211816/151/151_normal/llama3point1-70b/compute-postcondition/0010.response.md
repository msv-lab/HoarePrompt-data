Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least two elements, `i` is the second element in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, then `flat_list` contains twice the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. If `i` is not a list, then `flat_list` contains two `i`s and the elements returned by `func_1(i)` if `i` was previously a list, otherwise `flat_list` contains two `i`s***
