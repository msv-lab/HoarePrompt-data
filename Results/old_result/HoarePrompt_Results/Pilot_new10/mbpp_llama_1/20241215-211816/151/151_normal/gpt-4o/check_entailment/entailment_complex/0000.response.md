Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to flatten a given nested list structure, as described in the problem description. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a `nested_list` as input, which may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth.
2. The function initializes an empty list `flat_list` to store the flattened elements.
3. It then iterates over each `item` in the `nested_list`. If the `item` is a list, it recursively calls `func_1` on that `item` and extends the `flat_list` with the returned flattened list. If the `item` is not a list, it simply appends the `item` to the `flat_list`.
4. After iterating over all elements in the `nested_list`, the function returns the `flat_list`, which contains the flattened version of the `nested_list`.

This implementation correctly handles nested lists of any depth and ensures that all elements are properly flattened into a single list.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1([0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]) == [0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120]`, demonstrate the function's correctness in handling various scenarios.

The code's recursive nature allows it to handle nested lists of arbitrary depth, and the use of `isinstance(item, list)` ensures that only lists are recursively flattened, while non-list elements are simply appended to the `flat_list`.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the problem description and returns the expected output for all potential cases.
