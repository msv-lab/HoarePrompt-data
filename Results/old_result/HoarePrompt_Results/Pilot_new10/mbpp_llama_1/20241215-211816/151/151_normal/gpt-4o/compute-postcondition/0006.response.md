Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and must have at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in the `nested_list`. If `item` is a list, then `flat_list` contains the flattened version of `item`. If `item` is not a list, then `flat_list` contains the value of `item`.***
