Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct because it recursively flattens a given nested list structure, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The function `func_1` takes a `nested_list` as input and initializes an empty `flat_list` to store the flattened elements.
2. It then iterates over each `item` in the `nested_list`.
3. If the `item` is a list (checked using `isinstance(item, list)`), the function calls itself recursively with the `item` as the new `nested_list`. The `extend` method is used to add the flattened elements from the recursive call to the `flat_list`.
4. If the `item` is not a list (i.e., it's an integer), it is simply appended to the `flat_list`.
5. After iterating over all elements in the `nested_list`, the function returns the `flat_list`, which contains the flattened version of the input list.

This approach ensures that the function can handle nested lists of any depth, as it recursively flattens each inner list until it reaches the integers. The unit tests provided also demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs.

For example, when the input is `[0, 10, [20, 30], 40, 50, [60, 70, 80], [90, 100, 110, 120]]`, the function will recursively flatten the inner lists as follows:

* `[20, 30]` is flattened to `20, 30`
* `[60, 70, 80]` is flattened to `60, 70, 80`
* `[90, 100, 110, 120]` is flattened to `90, 100, 110, 120`

The final `flat_list` will contain the integers `0, 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, 100, 110, 120`, which is the correct flattened version of the input list.

Overall, the program accurately implements the problem description, making it correct.
