To understand the impact of the code on the program, we must consider the initial state and how the given line of code affects it.

Given that `nested_list` is a list with at least three elements and `i` is the third element in `nested_list`, we know `i` can be either a list or a non-list element.

The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))` implies that `func_1(i)` returns an iterable (like a list, tuple, etc.), and its elements are added to the end of `flat_list`.

If `i` is a list, the initial state condition implies that `flat_list` will contain twice the elements returned by `func_1(i)`. However, the given code line only extends `flat_list` with the elements returned by `func_1(i)` once. Therefore, after executing this line, `flat_list` will contain the elements returned by `func_1(i)` plus any elements it had before, but it won't reach twice the elements of `func_1(i)` solely based on this operation unless `flat_list` initially contained the same elements.

If `i` is not a list, then the condition about `flat_list` containing two `i`s and the elements returned by `func_1(i)` if `i` was previously a list suggests a conditional behavior based on the type and past state of `i`. However, this code line specifically adds elements returned by `func_1(i)` to `flat_list`, not the `i` values themselves.

Therefore, considering the provided code line `flat_list.extend(func_1(i))`, we can deduce the following about the output state:

- `nested_list` remains a list with at least three elements.
- `i` remains the third element in `nested_list`.
- The type of `i` (list or not) and its past state could influence what `func_1(i)` returns, but the direct outcome of this code line is that `flat_list` is extended by the elements returned by `func_1(i)`.
- The condition about containing twice the elements or including `i` values directly is not fully addressed by this single line of code, suggesting that additional operations or initial conditions of `flat_list` are relevant but not shown here.

Given these considerations, the output state after executing the provided code line would be:

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least three elements, `i` is the third element in `nested_list`, and `flat_list` contains its original elements plus the elements returned by `func_1(i)`**
