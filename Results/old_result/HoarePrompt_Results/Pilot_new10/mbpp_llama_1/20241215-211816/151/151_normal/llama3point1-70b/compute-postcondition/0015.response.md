To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code step by step.

The loop iterates over each element `i` in `nested_list`. If `i` is a list, it calls a function `func_1(i)` and extends `flat_list` with the returned elements. If `i` is not a list, it appends `i` to `flat_list`.

From the given output states after executing the loop for a few times, we can observe the following:

- The loop executes at least once if `nested_list` has at least one element.
- If `i` is a list, `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(i)`.
- If `i` is not a list, `flat_list` contains `i` as its element.
- The loop keeps track of all the elements processed so far, either by appending them directly or by extending `flat_list` with the results of `func_1(i)` if `i` is a list.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, we can infer the following about the output state:

- `nested_list` is the original list that may contain integers and/or other lists. Its state doesn't change during the loop execution.
- `flat_list` will contain all the elements from `nested_list`, but with any nested lists flattened by the `func_1` function if such a function exists and works as expected to flatten the list. If an element `i` in `nested_list` is a list, `func_1(i)` should return a flattened version of `i`.
- `i` will be the last element processed in `nested_list`.

Given that `func_1` is assumed to flatten the input list (though its actual implementation is not provided), the output state after all iterations can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`nested_list` is the original list, `flat_list` contains the flattened elements of `nested_list` where any nested lists are flattened by `func_1`, and `i` is the last element in `nested_list`. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` remains an empty list.**
