To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and must have at least 1 item.
- `flat_list` is an empty list.
- The current value of `item` is the first item in the `nested_list`, which is a list itself.

Given the code:
```python
flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
```
The impact of this code is to extend `flat_list` with the result of `func_1(item)`. 

Since `item` is the first item in `nested_list` and is a list itself, and assuming `func_1` is designed to flatten a nested list (as suggested by the context of flattening and extending `flat_list`), the result of `func_1(item)` would be a flattened list of integers.

After executing this code, the state of the variables would be:
- `nested_list` remains unchanged as it's not directly modified by the code.
- `flat_list` now contains the flattened version of `item` (the first sublist in `nested_list`).
- The value of `item` remains unchanged, still being the first item in `nested_list`, which is a list.

Therefore, considering the specifics of the task and the nature of the function `func_1` which is implied to flatten nested lists:
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and must have at least 1 item, `flat_list` contains the flattened version of the first item in `nested_list`, and the current value of `item` is the first item in the `nested_list`, which is a list.**
