Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code originally looks correct, and the output hints agree with the code. The function accepts a list that may contain integers and/or other lists as its elements, potentially nested to any depth, and returns a flattened version of this list. The provided unit tests confirm that the function works as expected for various nested list structures. 

The function uses recursion to flatten the list. It iterates over each item in the input list. If the item is a list, it calls itself with the sublist as an argument, effectively flattening the sublist and adding its elements to the result list. If the item is not a list (i.e., an integer), it simply appends the item to the result list. 

The function handles lists containing non-integer and non-list elements correctly, as it checks the type of each item before attempting to flatten it or append it to the result list. However, it may throw an error if the input is not a list, as mentioned in the output hints, but this aligns with the problem description. 

Since the function correctly handles nested lists of arbitrary depth and the examples provided in the problem description work as expected, it seems that the code does what the problem description says for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
