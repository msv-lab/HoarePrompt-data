The original assessment is None, indicating that no initial evaluation of the program's correctness was provided. Based on the problem description, the given code, and the output hints, we can conduct a thorough analysis to determine the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks for a function to flatten a given nested list structure. The provided code defines a recursive function `func_1` that iterates over each element in the input list. If an element is a list itself, the function calls itself with this sublist and extends the `flat_list` with the returned flattened sublist. If an element is not a list, it simply appends this element to the `flat_list`.

The output hints describe the functionality of `func_1` as accepting a list that can contain integers and/or other lists and returning a new list with all elements flattened to the top level, handling lists of arbitrary depth and including all types of elements found in the original list.

Given this information, the code provided seems to align with both the problem description and the output hints. It correctly handles nested lists of arbitrary depth and includes all types of elements found in the original list, not just integers, but any type of element that could be in the list.

Therefore, the original assessment of None does not provide any information to contradict, and based on the analysis, the program appears to be correct as per the given problem description and output hints.

Final: **True**
