Correctness: **True**.

This program correctly flattens a given nested list structure. The function `func_1` recursively traverses the nested list, checking each item to see if it's a list itself. If it is, the function calls itself with that sublist, effectively flattening it and adding its elements to the `flat_list`. If the item is not a list, it's simply appended to the `flat_list`.

This approach ensures that all elements, regardless of how deeply they're nested, are ultimately added to the `flat_list` in the correct order. The function handles lists of arbitrary depth and complexity, making it a correct solution to the problem.

I've considered various potential cases, including:

* Lists with multiple levels of nesting
* Lists containing a mix of integers and sublists
* Lists with empty sublists
* Lists with duplicate elements

In all of these cases, the function produces the expected output, which is a flat list containing all the elements from the original nested list. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
