Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` is designed to flatten a nested list structure. It uses recursion to handle lists of arbitrary depth. Here's why the code is correct:

1. **Base Case**: The function starts by checking each element `i` in the `nested_list`. If `i` is not a list (i.e., `type(i)!= list`), it simply appends `i` to the `flat_list`. This handles the base case where the element is not a list.

2. **Recursive Case**: If `i` is a list, the function calls itself with `i` as the new `nested_list`. This recursive call continues until it encounters elements that are not lists, at which point it starts appending them to the `flat_list`. This effectively handles lists of any depth.

3. **Handling Arbitrary Depth**: Because the function uses recursion, it can handle lists that are nested to any depth. Each recursive call breaks down the problem into smaller sub-problems until it reaches the base case, ensuring that all elements, regardless of how deeply nested, are eventually added to the `flat_list`.

4. **Including All Types of Elements**: The function does not discriminate based on the type of non-list elements it encounters. As long as an element is not a list, it will be appended to the `flat_list`, regardless of whether it's an integer, float, string, or any other type.

5. **Robustness**: The function appears to be robust and will work correctly for any input that matches the problem description (a list containing integers and/or other lists), including edge cases like an empty list or a list containing only non-list elements.

Given the provided output hints and the problem description, there are no obvious cases where the program would fail to meet the requirements. Therefore, the code is considered correct for all potential cases described.
