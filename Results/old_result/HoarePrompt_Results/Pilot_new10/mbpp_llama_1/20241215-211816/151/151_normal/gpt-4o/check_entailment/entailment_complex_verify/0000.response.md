To assess the correctness of the provided program, we need to evaluate it based on the problem description: to write a function that can flatten a given nested list structure. The provided program, `func_1`, is designed to handle lists that may contain integers and/or other lists as their elements, potentially nested to any depth.

The original assessment is "None", meaning there was no initial evaluation provided. Let's examine the program and the annotated version to determine its correctness.

The program `func_1` recursively traverses the input list. For each item in the list:
- If the item is a list, `func_1` calls itself with this sublist, effectively flattening it, and then extends the `flat_list` with the result.
- If the item is not a list, it is appended to `flat_list`.

The annotated version of the program describes the state at different parts:
- Before the function call, `nested_list` is any list that may contain integers and/or other lists, potentially nested.
- After the `for` loop, `flat_list` contains the flattened version of `nested_list`.
- The function returns `flat_list`, which is the flattened version of the input list.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to correctly implement a function to flatten nested lists. It handles lists of arbitrary depth and correctly distinguishes between list items that need further flattening and non-list items that should be appended directly to `flat_list`.

The reason the original assessment of "None" might seem inaccurate in hindsight is because it did not provide any evaluation or hint towards the correctness or incorrectness of the program. However, based on the analysis, the program indeed meets the criteria specified by the problem description.

Therefore, considering the detailed breakdown of the program's functionality and its alignment with the problem description, it's clear that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
