Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description, which is to convert a list to a tuple. The function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all elements from the list using the built-in `tuple()` function.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for various input lists. Additionally, the comments in the code accurately describe the function's behavior, including its ability to handle other iterable objects and potential errors when dealing with non-iterable objects.

It's worth noting that the problem description specifically mentions converting a list to a tuple, but the function is designed to be more versatile and can handle other iterable objects as well. This does not make the function incorrect, as it still meets the requirements of the problem description for the specific case of converting a list to a tuple.

In all cases where the input is a list, the function will correctly convert it to a tuple, which is the primary requirement specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
