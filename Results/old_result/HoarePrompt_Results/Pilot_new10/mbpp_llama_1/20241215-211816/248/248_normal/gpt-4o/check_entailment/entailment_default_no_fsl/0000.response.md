Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it simply uses the built-in `tuple()` function in Python, which can convert any iterable (including lists, strings, etc.) into a tuple. The function `func_1` takes a list as an input, and it correctly returns a tuple containing all the elements from the input list.

The output hints also agree with the code, as it mentions that if the object is a list, the tuple will contain all elements from the list. The hints also mention that if the object is not a list but is iterable (like a string), the tuple will contain its individual elements, which is also correct.

The function will work correctly for every potential case, including empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with multiple elements. It will also work correctly for other iterable objects, such as strings.

For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3])`, it will correctly return `(1, 2, 3)`. If we call `func_1([])`, it will correctly return `()`. If we call `func_1("hello")`, it will correctly return `('h', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o')`. 

Therefore, the code is correct and works as expected for every potential case.
