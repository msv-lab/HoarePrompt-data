To determine the final correctness of the program, we must first analyze the problem description, the original program, and the annotated version of the program.

The problem description asks for a function that converts a list to a tuple. The original program provided is:
```python
def func_1(input_list):
    return tuple(input_list)
```
The annotated version of the code indicates that the state of the program right before the function call is that `input_list` is a list, and after the function call, the program returns a tuple containing all elements from `input_list`.

Given this information, the original assessment being "None" implies a lack of initial judgment on the program's correctness. 

However, based on the provided code and the annotations, it's evident that the function `func_1` indeed takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing all the elements from the input list. This directly aligns with the problem description of converting a list to a tuple.

Therefore, the annotated version supports the notion that the program is correct, as it accurately reflects the intended behavior described in the problem statement. There are no indications from the annotations that would suggest the original program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.

Given the direct match between the problem description and the behavior of the program as outlined by the annotations, the original assessment's lack of judgment does not undermine the program's correctness based on the evidence provided.

Final: **True**
