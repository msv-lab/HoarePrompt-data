The function accepts an object, attempts to convert it into a tuple, and returns the resulting tuple. If the object is a list, the tuple will contain all elements from the list. If the object is not a list but is iterable (like a string), the tuple will contain its individual elements. If the object is not iterable, the function may raise an error.
