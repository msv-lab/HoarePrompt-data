The problem description asks for a function to convert a list to a tuple. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes an input list and returns a tuple created from that list using the `tuple()` function. This directly addresses the problem description.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting an input list and returning a tuple with all elements from the input list.

Given that the code directly implements the requested functionality and the output hints match the expected behavior, the original assessment of "None" can be inferred to mean that the program was correct as is, without needing any changes or further assessment.

Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints. 

Final: **True**
