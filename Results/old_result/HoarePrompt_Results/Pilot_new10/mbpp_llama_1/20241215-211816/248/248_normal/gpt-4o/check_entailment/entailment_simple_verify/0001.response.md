The original assessment is "None", which means there is no initial assessment provided. 

Based on the problem description, which is to write a function to convert a list to a tuple, and the provided code, it appears that the function `func_1` correctly achieves this goal. The function takes a list `lst` as input and returns a tuple that contains all elements from the list.

The annotated version of the code supports this conclusion. It states that the state of the program right before the function call is that `lst` is a list, and after the function call, the program returns a tuple that contains all elements from the list `lst`.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, it seems that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
