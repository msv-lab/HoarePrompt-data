The function `func_1` accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`. The function is supposed to return the maximum integer value found at index `n-1` across all rows in the `matrix`. However, looking at the code, it seems that the function actually returns the maximum integer value found at index `n-1` across all rows in the `matrix`, but it does not handle the case when `n` is 0. 

In Python, when `n` is 0, `n-1` would be -1, which is a valid index in Python, referring to the last element of the list. However, the annotations suggest that `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]), which implies that `n-1` should be a valid index for all rows in the `matrix`. 

If `n` is equal to the number of columns in `matrix`, `n-1` would be out of range for all rows, causing an `IndexError`. The function does not handle this potential edge case.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to return the maximum integer value found at index `n-1` across all rows in the `matrix`, but it may raise an `IndexError` if `n` is equal to the number of columns in `matrix`, and it treats `n` as 0 as a valid input, returning the maximum integer value found at the last index across all rows.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the maximum integer value found at index `n-1` across all rows in `matrix`. If `n` is equal to the number of columns in `matrix`, it raises an `IndexError`. If `n` is 0, it returns the maximum integer value found at the last index across all rows. **
