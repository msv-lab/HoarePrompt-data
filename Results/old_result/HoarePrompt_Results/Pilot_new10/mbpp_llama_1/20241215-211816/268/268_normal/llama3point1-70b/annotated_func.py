#State of the program right berfore the function call: matrix is a 2D list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n < len(matrix[0]).
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)
    #The program returns the maximum integer value found at index `n-1` across all rows in the `matrix`, where `n` is a specified non-negative integer less than the number of columns in `matrix`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a 2D list of integers `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n`, and returns the maximum integer value found at index `n-1` across all rows in `matrix`. If `n` is equal to the number of columns in `matrix`, it raises an `IndexError`. If `n` is 0, it returns the maximum integer value found at the last index across all rows.
