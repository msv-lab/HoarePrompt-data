Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a 2D list `matrix` and a non-negative integer `n` as input and returns the maximum value from the `n`-th column of the matrix. 

The function uses list comprehension to extract the `n`-th column from the matrix and then returns the maximum value from this column using the built-in `max` function.

The provided unit tests demonstrate that the function works correctly for different inputs. 

The output hints also suggest that the function may raise exceptions for edge cases such as an empty matrix, an out-of-range index `n`, or non-comparable elements. However, the function itself does not explicitly handle these cases, which could be a potential issue. 

But as per the problem description, it does not mention that the function should handle such edge cases. It simply asks for a function that given a matrix represented as a list of lists returns the max of the n'th column. 

Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided unit tests, the function appears to be correct for every potential case that is described in the problem description.
