Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(matrix, n)` correctly returns the maximum value in the n'th column of a given matrix. Here's why:

- The function uses a generator expression `(row[n - 1] for row in matrix)` to extract the elements in the n'th column. 
- It then uses the built-in `max` function to find the maximum of these elements.
- The function correctly handles 1-based indexing by using `n - 1`, which ensures that the first column is accessed when `n` is 1.

One potential issue could be if the input matrix is empty, or if the column index `n` is out of range. However, the function will correctly raise an exception in these cases (e.g., `IndexError` or `ValueError`), which is a reasonable behavior.

No example was found where the program does not work as expected according to the description, therefore the program is correct.
