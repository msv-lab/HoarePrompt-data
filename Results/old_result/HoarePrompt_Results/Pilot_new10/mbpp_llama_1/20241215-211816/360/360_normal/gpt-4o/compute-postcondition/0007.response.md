Postcondition: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 inner list, `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the first inner list of `list_of_lists`. If `current_sum` is greater than the initial `max_sum` (negative infinity), then `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum` and `max_list` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.**
