Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is None, which means there was no initial assessment of the program's correctness. 

However, after examining the code and the annotated version, it appears that the program is correctly implemented to solve the problem. The function `func_1` iterates over each sublist in the `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of each sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum. 

The annotated version of the code provides additional insights into the state of the program at different points, which confirms that the program is working as expected. The state before the function call is valid, and the state after the for loop has been executed accurately reflects the maximum sum and the corresponding sublist.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is that it is correct based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

Final: **True**
