To assess the program's correctness, let's analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints.

The problem description asks for a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. The provided code implements this using the `max` function with `key=sum`, which returns the first list with the maximum sum if there are multiple.

The original assessment is "None," which means there is no prior assessment to evaluate against.

The output hints provide crucial information about the function's behavior:
- It accepts a non-empty list of lists of numbers and returns a sublist with the maximum sum of its numbers.
- If the input list is empty, it raises a ValueError. However, the provided code does not explicitly handle this case; Python's built-in `max` function will raise a ValueError if the input list is empty.
- If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns one of them.
- The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of lists of numbers or where the sublists contain non-numeric values.

Given this information, the code seems to correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem statement. It returns the list with the maximum sum, handles the case of an empty input list implicitly through Python's built-in error handling, and behaves as described for cases of multiple maximum sums.

However, the code and the output hints both acknowledge that the function does not handle invalid input scenarios, such as non-numeric values within sublists or input that is not a list of lists. This lack of error handling could be considered a limitation but does not affect the program's correctness under the assumption that the input will always be valid, as stated.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, and considering the assumption of always valid inputs, the program correctly achieves its intended purpose.

Final: **True**
