According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 3 inner lists, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` has at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the second inner list of `list_of_lists`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 inner lists and the `sublist` is the third inner list in `list_of_lists`. 
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 inner lists, `sublist` is the third inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the third inner list of `list_of_lists`**
