To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 inner lists.
- `sublist` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`.
- `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the second inner list of `list_of_lists`.
- `max_sum` is the sum of the elements in the second inner list of `list_of_lists`.
- `max_list` is either the first inner list or the second inner list depending on the values.

The code provided is:
```python
max_list = sublist
```

From the code, we can see that `max_list` is assigned the value of `sublist`, which is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`. 

Given the initial state, `sublist` is already defined as the second inner list, so `max_list` is now explicitly set to this second inner list, regardless of its original value (which could have been the first inner list or the second, depending on the conditions not specified in the initial state but implied by the variable's possible values).

The values of `list_of_lists`, `sublist`, `current_sum`, and `max_sum` are not changed by the code. Only the value of `max_list` is updated, and it is set to be the same as `sublist`, which is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 inner lists.
- `sublist` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`.
- `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the second inner list of `list_of_lists`.
- `max_sum` is the sum of the elements in the second inner list of `list_of_lists`.
- `max_list` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`, which is the same as `sublist`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the second inner list of `list_of_lists`, `max_sum` is the sum of the elements in the second inner list of `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`, equal to `sublist`.**
