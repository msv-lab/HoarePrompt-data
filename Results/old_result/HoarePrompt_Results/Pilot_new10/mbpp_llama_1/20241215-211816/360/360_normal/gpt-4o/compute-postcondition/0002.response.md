According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numbers, and `list_of_lists` is not empty; `max_sum` is negative infinity; `max_list` is an empty list. This state does ensure that the loop will execute, but for clarity, we can specify that `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 inner list and `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`.
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 inner list, `max_sum` is negative infinity, `max_list` is an empty list, `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`**
