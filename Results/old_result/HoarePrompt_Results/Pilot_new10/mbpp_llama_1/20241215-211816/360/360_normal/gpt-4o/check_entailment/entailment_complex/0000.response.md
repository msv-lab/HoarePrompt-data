Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through each sublist in the input list of lists, calculates the sum of elements in each sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum. Once it has checked all sublists, it returns the sublist with the maximum sum.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list. This ensures that the first sublist will always have a greater sum than `max_sum`, and `max_list` will be updated to the first sublist.

2. The function then iterates through each sublist in the input list of lists. For each sublist, it calculates the sum of elements using the built-in `sum` function.

3. If the sum of the current sublist is greater than `max_sum`, the function updates `max_sum` to the current sum and `max_list` to the current sublist. This ensures that `max_sum` always stores the maximum sum of elements seen so far, and `max_list` stores the corresponding sublist.

4. After iterating through all sublists, the function returns `max_list`, which is the sublist with the maximum sum of elements.

The program handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty inner lists: The program will skip empty inner lists because their sum will be 0, and will return the first non-empty sublist it encounters with the maximum sum.
* Non-numeric elements: The program assumes that all elements are numeric, and will raise a TypeError if it encounters a non-numeric element.
* Empty input list of lists: The program will return an empty list if the input list of lists is empty.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic to find the sublist with the maximum sum of elements in a list of lists, as described in the problem description.
