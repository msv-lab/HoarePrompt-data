The code initializes a variable `max_sum` to negative infinity. The initial state mentions that `list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing numbers and is not empty. This information about `list_of_lists` remains unchanged as the code snippet only introduces a new variable `max_sum` without modifying `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numbers, and `list_of_lists` is not empty; `max_sum` is negative infinity**
