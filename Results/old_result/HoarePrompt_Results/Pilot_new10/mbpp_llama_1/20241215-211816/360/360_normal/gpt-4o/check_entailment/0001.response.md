Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct. It iterates through each sublist in the list of lists, calculates the sum of elements in the current sublist, and checks if it's greater than the current maximum sum. If it is, the program updates the maximum sum and the corresponding sublist. This process ensures that the sublist with the highest sum of elements is returned.

The program handles various cases, including:

*   Sublists with different lengths
*   Sublists with different element values
*   A list of lists containing only one sublist
*   A list of lists containing multiple sublists with the same maximum sum (in this case, it returns the first one it encounters)

The use of `float('-inf')` to initialize `max_sum` ensures that the first sublist's sum will always be greater, avoiding potential issues with initial maximum sum values.

The program's logic is straightforward and correctly implemented, making it correct for all potential cases.
