To calculate the output state, we first analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code. 

The initial state is as follows:
- `list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 inner list.
- `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`.
- `max_list` is an empty list.
- `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`.
- `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the first inner list of `list_of_lists`.

Given the code:
```python
max_list = sublist
```

The impact of this code is that it assigns the value of `sublist` to `max_list`. 

From the initial state, we know that `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`. 

Therefore, `max_list` now holds the value of the first inner list in `list_of_lists`, which is the same as `sublist`.

The states of the other variables (`list_of_lists`, `max_sum`, `sublist`, `current_sum`) are not affected by this assignment.

Hence, the output state, considering the update to `max_list`, is:
- `list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 inner list.
- `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`.
- `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, which is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`.
- `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`.
- `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the first inner list of `list_of_lists`.

Given the direct relationship and the fact that `max_list` now equals `sublist`, and considering that `sublist` is the first inner list of `list_of_lists`, we can express the output state as follows:

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 inner list, `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`, `sublist` is the first inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the first inner list of `list_of_lists`**
