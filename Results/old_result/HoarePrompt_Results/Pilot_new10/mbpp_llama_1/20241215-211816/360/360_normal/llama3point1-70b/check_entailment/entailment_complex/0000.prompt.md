You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that returns the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lists is a list of lists of numbers.
def func_1(lists):
    return max(lists, key=sum)
    #The program returns a sublist from 'lists' that has the maximum sum of its numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of lists of numbers and returns a sublist with the maximum sum of its numbers. If the input list is empty, it raises a ValueError. If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, it returns one of them. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a list of lists of numbers or where the sublists contain non-numeric values.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
