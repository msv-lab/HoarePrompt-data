Postcondition: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 inner lists, `sublist` is the second inner list in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in the second inner list of `list_of_lists`. If `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is set to the second inner list, which is equal to `sublist`. Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged, with `max_sum` being the sum of the elements in the first inner list and `max_list` being the first inner list.**
