Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the list whose sum of elements is the highest. The `max` function with the `key` argument set to `sum` is used to achieve this. This approach is correct and efficient.

Here's why the code is correct:

* The `max` function will iterate over all sublists in the input list of lists.
* For each sublist, the `sum` function calculates the sum of its elements.
* The `max` function then returns the sublist with the maximum sum.

This approach handles all potential cases correctly:

* If there are multiple sublists with the same maximum sum, `max` will return one of them, which is a valid result.
* If the input list of lists is empty, `max` will raise a `ValueError`, which is an expected behavior.
* If a sublist contains non-numeric elements, `sum` will raise a `TypeError`, which is an expected behavior.

Overall, the code correctly implements the described functionality, and no counterexamples can be found.
