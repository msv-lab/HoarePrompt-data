To understand the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's analyze the provided annotated code and return postconditions.

1. **Parameters and Return Value**: The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists containing numbers. It returns the inner list with the maximum sum of elements.

2. **Functionality Based on Code**:
   - The function iterates over each inner list in `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of elements in each inner list, and keeps track of the inner list with the maximum sum found so far.
   - If an inner list has a sum greater than the current maximum sum (`max_sum`), it updates `max_sum` with this new sum and stores the current inner list as `max_list`.
   - After iterating over all inner lists, it returns `max_list`, which is the inner list with the maximum sum of elements.

3. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - **Empty Inner Lists**: The function can handle empty inner lists since the sum of an empty list is 0. However, if all inner lists are empty, `max_list` will be an empty list because the initial `max_list` is set to an empty list and the maximum sum (`max_sum`) is initialized to negative infinity.
   - **Non-Numeric Elements**: The function does not check if the elements in the inner lists are numbers. If an inner list contains non-numeric elements, attempting to sum its elements will result in a TypeError.
   - **Ties for Maximum Sum**: If multiple inner lists have the same maximum sum, the function returns the first one it encounters. This behavior might be considered an edge case, but it is a clear consequence of the function's implementation.
   - **Empty `list_of_lists`**: The annotations specify that `list_of_lists` is not empty. However, if `list_of_lists` were empty, the function would return an empty list (`max_list`) because the loop would not execute, and no updates would be made to `max_list` or `max_sum`.

4. **Functionality Summary**:
   - The function accepts a non-empty list of lists containing numbers and returns the first inner list it encounters with the maximum sum of elements.
   - It handles empty inner lists by considering their sum as 0.
   - It assumes all elements in the inner lists are numeric; otherwise, it will raise a TypeError.
   - If multiple inner lists have the same maximum sum, it returns the first one encountered.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists containing numbers and returns the first inner list it encounters with the maximum sum of elements, handling empty inner lists and assuming all elements are numeric, with a potential TypeError if non-numeric elements are present, and returning an empty list if the input list of lists is empty or all inner lists are empty. **
