#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each inner list contains numbers, and list_of_lists is not empty.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_sum = float('-inf')
    max_list = []
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        current_sum = sum(sublist)
        
        if current_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = current_sum
            max_list = sublist
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each inner list contains numbers, `max_sum` is the maximum sum of elements in any inner list in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list` is the inner list with the maximum sum of elements.
    return max_list
    #The program returns max_list, which is the inner list with the maximum sum of elements in list_of_lists
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists containing numbers and returns the first inner list it encounters with the maximum sum of elements, handling empty inner lists and assuming all elements are numeric, with a potential TypeError if non-numeric elements are present, and returning an empty list if the input list of lists is empty or all inner lists are empty.
