The original assessment is None, which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that iterates through a list of lists, calculates the sum of elements in each sublist, and returns the sublist with the maximum sum.

The output hints summarize the functionality of `func_1`, indicating that it correctly handles empty inner lists, returns an empty list if the input list of lists is empty or all inner lists are empty, and potentially raises a TypeError if non-numeric elements are present.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the program appears to be correct. It correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, returning the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.

The code handles the edge cases mentioned in the output hints, such as empty inner lists and empty input lists, and it assumes all elements are numeric, as expected.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
