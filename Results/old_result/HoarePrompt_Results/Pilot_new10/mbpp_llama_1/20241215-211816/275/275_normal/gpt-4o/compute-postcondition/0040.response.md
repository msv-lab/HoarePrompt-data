To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code is designed to update the `dp` array based on the divisibility of `nums[i]` by `nums[j]`, where `j` ranges from `0` to `i-1`. The update rule is to set `dp[i]` to the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.

Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:

- `nums` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty.
- `i` increases with each iteration, indicating the loop's progress.
- `j` takes on values from `0` to `i-1` during each iteration of the outer loop (not explicitly shown but implied by the range in the inner loop).
- `dp[i]` is updated to reflect the maximum chain of divisors ending at `nums[i]`, considering all previous numbers `nums[j]` that divide `nums[i]`.

After all iterations have finished, the values of the variables can be summarized as follows:

- `nums` remains unchanged as it is the input list.
- `i` would have iterated over the entire range of indices of `nums`, given the loop's structure is a `for` loop with a predefined range.
- `dp` would contain the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`, where a chain of divisors is defined by a sequence of numbers where each number is a divisor of the next.

Considering the loop's purpose and its updates, if the loop does not execute (which would happen if the input list `nums` is empty, contradicting the initial state that `nums` is not empty), the state of the variables would remain as in the initial state, with `dp` reflecting no updates since no iterations occurred.

However, based on the given initial state that `nums` is not empty, the loop will execute. Therefore, after all iterations:

- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, not empty.
- `i` has conceptually iterated over all indices of `nums`.
- `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`.

Considering the initial state and the loop's operation, the output state can be determined as follows:

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`.**
