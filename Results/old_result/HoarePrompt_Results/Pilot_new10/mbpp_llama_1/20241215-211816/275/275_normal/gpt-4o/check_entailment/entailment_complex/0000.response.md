Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The problem asks for the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. 

The function `func_1` sorts the input list `nums` in ascending order and then uses dynamic programming to build up a table `dp` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest chain of divisors for `nums[i]`. It does this by checking for each number `nums[i]` whether it can be divided by any of the previous numbers `nums[j]` in the sorted list. If it can, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

This approach ensures that every pair in the subset is divisible because it only extends the chain of divisors if the current number can be divided by the previous number. The function finally returns the maximum value in the `dp` table, which represents the length of the longest chain of divisors.

The given unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function for the provided cases. 

The function handles the case of an empty list correctly by returning 0, as specified in the problem description. For non-empty lists, it correctly identifies the longest chain of divisors, which is the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible.

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, making it correct.
