To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the loop statement:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```
And the state before the loop starts:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements.
- `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1.
- `i` is 1.

The loop will execute based on the value of `i`, as `j` takes values from `range(i)`. Since `i` is initially 1, `range(i)` will generate numbers from 0 up to but not including 1, meaning `j` will only take the value 0 for `i = 1`.

For the loop to execute at least once, `i` needs to be greater than 0 because `range(0)` would not generate any numbers, and thus the loop would not execute. Given that `i` is already 1, this condition is met.

Considering the initial states and the loop condition, the adjusted state to reflect the start of the loop execution would be:
- `nums` remains a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements.
- `dp` remains a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1.
- `i` is 1, which allows the loop to execute because `range(1)` generates the number 0.
- `j` would be 0 at the start of the loop since it iterates over `range(i)`, and `i` is 1.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
