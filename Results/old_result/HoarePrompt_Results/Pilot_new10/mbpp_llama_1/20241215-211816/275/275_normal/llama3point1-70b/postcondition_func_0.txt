The function accepts a list of integers, returns 0 if the list is empty, and otherwise returns the maximum length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors for any number in the list, assuming the input list only contains integers and is not extremely large. If the input list contains non-integer values, non-numeric values, or is None, the function's behavior is undefined.
