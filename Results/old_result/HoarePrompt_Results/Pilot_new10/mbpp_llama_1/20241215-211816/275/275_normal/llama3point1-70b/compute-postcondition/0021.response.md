Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1 and is greater than 0, if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged, and `j` is 0***
