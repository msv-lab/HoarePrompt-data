According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1 and `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the previous `nums`. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be increased by 1. So, `j` becomes 2. 
State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with a length greater than the previous `nums`, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`, `i` is greater than 1 and equals the length of the previous `nums`, and `j` is 2**
