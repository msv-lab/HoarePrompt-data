Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(nums)` correctly implements a dynamic programming approach to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. Here's why:

1. The function first checks if the input list `nums` is empty. If it is, the function returns 0, which is correct because an empty list cannot have a non-empty subset.

2. The function then sorts the list `nums` in ascending order. This is done to ensure that for any pair of numbers, the smaller number comes first, which is necessary for the dynamic programming approach to work correctly.

3. The function initializes a list `dp` of the same length as `nums`, where `dp[i]` represents the size of the largest subset ending at index `i` such that every pair is divisible. The list `dp` is initialized with all elements set to 1, which means that every number itself forms a subset of size 1.

4. The function then iterates over the list `nums` from the second element to the last element. For each element at index `i`, it iterates over the previous elements (from the first element to the element at index `i-1`). If the current element at index `i` is divisible by any of the previous elements, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` is the index of the previous element.

5. Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the list `dp`, which represents the size of the largest subset such that every pair is divisible.

This approach is correct because it considers all possible subsets and ensures that every pair of numbers in the subset is divisible. The dynamic programming approach allows the function to efficiently compute the solution by building up the solution from smaller subproblems.

The function handles all edge cases correctly, including the case where the input list is empty, the case where the list contains only one element, and the case where the list contains multiple elements. It also handles cases where the numbers in the list are not necessarily distinct.

Overall, the provided Python function `func_1(nums)` is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
