According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. 

The range of the loop is `range(i)`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be increased by 1 and the loop will iterate over `range(i+1)`, that is from 0 to `i`. Since we don't know the exact values of `nums` and `dp` but we know `nums` is not empty and is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`, these states remain the same.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums`, `i` is greater than 2**
