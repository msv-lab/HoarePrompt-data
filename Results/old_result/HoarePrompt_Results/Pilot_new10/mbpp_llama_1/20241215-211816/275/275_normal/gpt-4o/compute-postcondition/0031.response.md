Postcondition: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and not empty, `dp` reflects the chains of divisors up to the current `i`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. The current value of `nums[i]` is a multiple of the current value of `nums[j]`, specifically, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` with no remainder.**
