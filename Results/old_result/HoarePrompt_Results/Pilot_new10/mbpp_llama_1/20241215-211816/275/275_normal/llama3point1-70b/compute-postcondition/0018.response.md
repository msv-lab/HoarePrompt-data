According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, and `nums` has at least 3 elements, `i` is at least 2. This means `j` will take values from 0 to `i-1`. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is the last index of `nums`, and `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]`. For the loop to be executed, `i` must be greater than 0, and `j` will be initialized to 0.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1 and must be greater than 0, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i]` and has at least one more element, `j` is 0**
