The code creates a new list `dp` with the same length as `nums`, where each element in `dp` is initialized to 1. The initial state of `nums` being a sorted list of integers in ascending order and not empty is still valid after the code execution.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, and the list is not empty, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1**
