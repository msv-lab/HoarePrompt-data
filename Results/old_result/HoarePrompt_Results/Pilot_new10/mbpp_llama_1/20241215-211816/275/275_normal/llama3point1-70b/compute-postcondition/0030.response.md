According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `i` is equal to the original length of `nums`, `dp` has a length equal to the length of `nums` with `dp[i-1]` being the maximum length of the increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i-1]`, and `j` is `i-1`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0, and `j` will take values from `i-1` down to 0.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `i` is equal to the original length of `nums` and must be greater than 0, `dp` has a length equal to the length of `nums` with `dp[i-1]` being the maximum length of the increasing subsequence of divisors ending at `nums[i-1]`, and `j` will range from `i-1` down to 0**
