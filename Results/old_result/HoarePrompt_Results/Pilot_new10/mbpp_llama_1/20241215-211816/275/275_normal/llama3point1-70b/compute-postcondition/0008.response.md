The code updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `dp[i]` is initially 1 and `dp[j]` is also 1, `dp[i]` will be updated to 2 because `nums[i]` is a multiple of `nums[j]`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where `dp[i]` is 2 and all other elements are 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where `dp[i]` is 2 and all other elements are 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 0**
