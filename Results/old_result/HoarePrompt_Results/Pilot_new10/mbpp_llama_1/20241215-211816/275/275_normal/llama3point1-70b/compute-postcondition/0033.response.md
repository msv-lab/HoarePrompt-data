Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 4 elements, `i` is equal to the original length of `nums` and is greater than 0, `dp` has a length equal to the length of `nums` where if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for any `j` ranging from `i-1` down to 0, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains unchanged, and `j` has ranged from `i-1` down to 0***
