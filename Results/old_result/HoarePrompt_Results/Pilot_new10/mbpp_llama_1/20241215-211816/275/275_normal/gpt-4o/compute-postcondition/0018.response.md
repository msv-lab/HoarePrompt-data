To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty.
- `nums` must have at least the length of the previous `nums` + 1 elements.
- `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`.
- `i` equals the length of the previous `nums`.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i):`, which means the loop will iterate from 0 to `i-1`.

For this loop to execute:
- `i` must be greater than 0 because `range(i)` needs to have at least one element to iterate over. Given that `i` equals the length of the previous `nums`, this implies that the previous `nums` must not have been empty.
- Since `i` is the length of the previous `nums`, and we know `nums` must have at least the length of the previous `nums` + 1 elements, it aligns with the condition that `i` must be greater than 0 for the loop to execute.
- `j` will take values from 0 to `i-1` during each iteration of the loop.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order, not empty, and has at least one more element than the previous `nums`, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`, `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the previous `nums`, `j` is 0**
