Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `j` is 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` where `dp[i]` is 2 and all other elements are 1. Otherwise, the state of `dp` remains unchanged with all elements equal to 1***
