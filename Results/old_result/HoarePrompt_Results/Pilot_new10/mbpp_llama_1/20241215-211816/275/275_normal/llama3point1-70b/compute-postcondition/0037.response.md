According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1 because the loop iterates over the range from 0 to `i-1`. Since `nums` has at least 5 elements and `i` is equal to the new length of `nums`, increasing `i` by 1 means `nums` must have at least 6 elements. The length of `dp` is equal to the new length of `nums`, so it must also be increased by 1. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 6 elements, `i` is equal to the new length of `nums` and is greater than 1, `dp` has a length equal to the new length of `nums`**
