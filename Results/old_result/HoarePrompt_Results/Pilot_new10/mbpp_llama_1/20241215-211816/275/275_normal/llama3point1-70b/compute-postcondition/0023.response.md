To calculate the result, we need to understand the given code and the initial state. 

The initial state is: 
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, 
- `i` is greater than 1, 
- if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, 
- otherwise, `dp[i]` remains unchanged, 
- and `j` is 1.

Given the code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`, it updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. 

Since `j` is 1, the code is comparing `dp[i]` with `dp[1] + 1` and updating `dp[i]` accordingly.

The output state is: 
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, 
- `i` is greater than 1, 
- `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + 1`, 
- `j` is 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 3 elements, `i` is greater than 1, `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + 1`, `j` is 1**
