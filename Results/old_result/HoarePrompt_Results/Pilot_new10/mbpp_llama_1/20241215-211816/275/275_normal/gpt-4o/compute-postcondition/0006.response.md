According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. If `i` is at least 1, the loop can execute because `range(i)` will have at least one element. However, given that `i` is 0, `range(i)` will be empty and the loop will not execute. 

For the loop to execute, `i` must be greater than 0. Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers and `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1, these conditions do not directly affect the execution of the loop. Nonetheless, they should still be considered as part of the state.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1, `i` must be greater than 0**
