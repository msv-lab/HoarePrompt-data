Postcondition: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with a length greater than the previous `nums`, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`, otherwise `dp[i]` remains unchanged, `i` is greater than 0 and equals the length of the previous `nums`, and `j` is 1.**
