Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order with at least 6 elements, `i` is equal to the new length of `nums` and is greater than 1, `dp` has a length equal to the new length of `nums`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + 1`***
