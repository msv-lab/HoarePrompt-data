Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code is designed to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible. The function `func_1` sorts the input list `nums` in ascending order and initializes a dynamic programming (DP) array `dp` with all elements set to 1, representing the minimum length of a divisible subset that can be formed with each number.

The function then iterates over the sorted list, and for each pair of numbers `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` where `i > j`, it checks if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`. If it is, the function updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, effectively extending the divisible subset by including `nums[i]`.

The function returns the maximum value in the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest subset of numbers where every pair is divisible.

The output hints agree with the code, and they do not provide any specific cases that the code does not handle correctly. The function correctly handles the edge case where the input list is empty, returning 0 in this case.

In general, the code follows the problem description and should work correctly for all potential cases. The use of dynamic programming ensures that the function efficiently considers all possible subsets of the input list and finds the largest one that satisfies the divisibility condition.
