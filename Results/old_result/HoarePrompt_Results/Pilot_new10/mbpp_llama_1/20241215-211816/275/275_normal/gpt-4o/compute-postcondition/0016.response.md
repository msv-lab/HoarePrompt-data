To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code is:
```python
for j in range(i):
    if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
        dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

The initial state is:
- `nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty.
- `dp` is a list of the same length as `nums` with all elements equal to 1.
- `i` is 0.

The output states after the loop executes some number of times give us hints about how `dp` is updated based on the divisibility of `nums[i]` by `nums[j]`, where `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`. 

After analyzing the loop code and the given output states, we can deduce the following:

1. The loop iterates over the list `nums`, and for each `nums[i]`, it checks all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`) to see if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.
2. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, the value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. This essentially means that if there's a previous number that divides the current number, the length of the divisor chain (represented by `dp`) is increased by 1, compared to the divisor chain length of the previous divisor.
3. The `dp` list is initially all 1s, which means every number is considered to have a divisor chain length of at least 1 (the number itself).

Considering these points and the fact that `nums` is sorted in ascending order, the loop's purpose seems to be finding the longest chain of divisors for each number in `nums` where each subsequent number in the chain divides the next.

After all iterations are complete, the values of the variables will be as follows:

- `nums` remains the same as it's not modified by the loop.
- `i` will be equal to the length of `nums` because the loop seems to be designed to iterate over `nums` with `i` taking on each index value from 0 to the end of `nums`. However, the actual loop is not provided, so based on the given information, we infer `i`'s behavior from the output states given.
- `dp` will contain the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`, where a chain is defined by the divisibility relationship as described.

So, the output state after all iterations of the loop will be:

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers in ascending order and is not empty, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest chains of divisors for each number in `nums`, `i` equals the length of `nums`.**
