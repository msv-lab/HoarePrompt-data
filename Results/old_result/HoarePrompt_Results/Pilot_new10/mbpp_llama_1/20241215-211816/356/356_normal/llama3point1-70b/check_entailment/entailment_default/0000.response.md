Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code provided in the problem description only removes spaces from the input string, but the problem description asks to remove all whitespaces. In Python, whitespace characters include not only spaces but also tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), and others. The `replace` method used in the code only removes spaces, leaving other types of whitespace characters intact. For example, if the input string is `"Hello\tWorld\n"`, the function will return `"Hello\tWorld\n"`, which still contains whitespace characters. To correctly remove all whitespace characters, a different approach would be needed, such as using the `replace` method to remove each type of whitespace character individually or using a regular expression.
