To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program in removing all whitespaces from a string, let's examine the original assessment, the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version of the code.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that removes all whitespaces from a given string.

2. **Original Assessment**: There is no original assessment provided.

3. **Original Code**:
   ```python
def func_1(input_str):
    return input_str.replace(' ', '')
   ```
   This code defines a function `func_1` that takes an input string `input_str` and uses the `replace` method to remove all occurrences of spaces (' ') from the string, returning the modified string.

4. **Annotated Code**:
   ```python
# State of the program right before the function call: input_str is a string.
def func_1(input_str):
    return input_str.replace(' ', '')
    # The program returns a string where all spaces have been removed from the initial string `input_str`.
   ```
   The annotations clarify the state of the program before the function is called (i.e., `input_str` is a string) and describe the outcome of the function (i.e., it returns the input string with all spaces removed).

Given the above information, let's assess the program's correctness:

- The function `func_1` is designed to remove spaces from the input string, which it does by using the `replace` method.
- However, the task is to remove **all whitespaces**, not just spaces (' '). Whitespace characters include spaces (' '), tabs ('\t'), newline characters ('\n'), and others.
- The provided code only removes spaces (' '), not other types of whitespace characters.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code does not fully achieve the task of removing all whitespaces from a string. It only removes space characters, not other types of whitespace.

Final: **False**
