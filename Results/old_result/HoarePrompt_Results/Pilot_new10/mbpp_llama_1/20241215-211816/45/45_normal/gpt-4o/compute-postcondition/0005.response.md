The code assigns the value of the second character of string `s` to the variable `second_digit`. Since `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of more than or equal to 3, the second character of `s` corresponds to the second digit of `n`. 

The value of `n` is still a positive integer greater than or equal to 100, and `s` is still a string representation of `n` with a length of more than or equal to 3. The value of `first_digit` is still the first character of `s`, which is the first digit of `n`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 100, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of more than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, which is the first digit of `n`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, which is the second digit of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 100, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of more than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, which is the first digit of `n`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, which is the second digit of `n`.**
