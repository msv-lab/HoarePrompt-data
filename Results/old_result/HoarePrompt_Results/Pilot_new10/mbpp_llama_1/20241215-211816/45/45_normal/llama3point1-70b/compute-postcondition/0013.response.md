Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 4, `i` is 2. If the current value of `n` at index `i-1` is less than the value at index `i` and the value at index `i` is less than the value at index `i+1`, or the value at index `i-1` is greater than the value at index `i` and the value at index `i` is greater than the value at index `i+1`, then `undulating` is `True`. Otherwise, `undulating` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
