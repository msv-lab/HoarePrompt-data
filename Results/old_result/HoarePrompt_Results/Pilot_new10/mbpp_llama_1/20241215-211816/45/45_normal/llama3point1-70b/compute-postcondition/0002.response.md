To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement:

```python
for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Given that `n` is a string representation of a positive integer and `undulating` is `True`, we need to consider the conditions under which this loop will execute.

1. **The loop will execute if `len(n) - 1` is greater than 1**: This means `len(n)` must be at least 3, because the `range` function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value. Thus, for `i` to take on at least one value (which is 1, given the start of the range is 1), the length of `n` must be sufficient to allow `i` to range from 1 up to but not including `len(n) - 1`.

2. **The value of `undulating` does not directly affect the loop's execution**: While `undulating` is `True`, its value does not influence whether the loop will execute or not. The execution of the loop depends solely on the length of `n` and the range defined in the loop.

3. **The state of `i`**: Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined in the context of the loop. Once the loop begins, `i` will take on the value of 1 in the first iteration.

Considering these points, for the loop to execute:

- `n` must be a string of length at least 3, since `len(n) - 1` needs to be greater than 1 for the loop to have an iteration.
- `undulating` being `True` does not affect the loop's condition but is part of the initial state.
- `i` will start at 1 as per the loop definition.

State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with a length of at least 3, `undulating` is `True`, `i` is 1**
