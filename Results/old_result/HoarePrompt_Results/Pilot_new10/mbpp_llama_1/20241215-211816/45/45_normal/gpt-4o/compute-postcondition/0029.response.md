The function func_1 accepts a positive integer n and returns True if the number meets certain conditions, and False otherwise. 

After analyzing the code line by line, here is how it works:
- If the length of the string representation of n is less than 3, it returns False.
- If the first and second digits of n are the same, it returns False.
- Then, it checks every even-indexed digit (starting from the 3rd digit, index 2) to see if it's equal to the first digit of n. If it finds one that's not equal, it returns False.
- It also checks every odd-indexed digit (starting from the 3rd digit, index 2) to see if it's equal to the second digit of n. If it finds one that's not equal, it returns False.
- If none of the above conditions cause it to return False, it returns True, indicating that n's digits alternate between the first and second digits.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer n, checks if its string representation has a length of at least 3, and if the first and second digits are different. Then it checks if every even-indexed digit (starting from index 2) is equal to the first digit, and every odd-indexed digit (starting from index 2) is equal to the second digit. If all these conditions are met, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. **
