Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code checks whether a given number is undulating or not. An undulating number is defined as a number where all sequences of three adjacent digits are either in ascending or descending order. The function `func_1` converts the input number to a string and then iterates over each digit in the string, checking if the current digit and its adjacent digits are in ascending or descending order. If any sequence of three adjacent digits does not meet this condition, the function returns `False`, indicating that the number is not undulating. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The code handles all potential cases, including numbers with fewer than three digits, which are considered undulating by default. The output hints agree with the code and indicate that the function checks for ascending or descending order in all sequences of three adjacent digits and returns `True` for integers with fewer than three digits.

The code correctly handles edge cases, such as single-digit numbers and two-digit numbers, which are considered undulating. It also correctly handles numbers with three or more digits, checking each sequence of three adjacent digits to ensure they are in ascending or descending order.

Overall, the code meets the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly, making it a correct implementation of the undulating number check.
