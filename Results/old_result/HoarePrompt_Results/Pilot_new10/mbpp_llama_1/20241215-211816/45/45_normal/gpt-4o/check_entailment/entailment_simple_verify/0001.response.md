The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` checks if a given number is undulating or not by verifying that it has at least 3 digits, its first two digits are different, and the remaining digits alternate between the first two digits. 

The annotated version of the code confirms this assessment by specifying the state of the program at various points, including after each conditional check and after the loop. These annotations align with the original assessment's explanation of the function's behavior.

One key point of consideration is whether the function correctly handles edge cases, such as numbers with fewer than 3 digits or numbers where the first two digits are the same. The function returns `False` in these cases, which is consistent with the definition of an undulating number.

The provided assertions also support the correctness of the function, demonstrating its behavior with different inputs and expected outputs.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the function is correct based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
