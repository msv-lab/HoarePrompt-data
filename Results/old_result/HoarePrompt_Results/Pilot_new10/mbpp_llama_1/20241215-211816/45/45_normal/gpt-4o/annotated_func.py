#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer.
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if (len(s) < 3) :
        return False
        #The program returns False

    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if (first_digit == second_digit) :
        return False
        #The program returns False
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 100, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of more than or equal to 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, which is the first digit of `n`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, which is the second digit of `n`, and the `first_digit` is not equal to the `second_digit`.
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 100, `s` is a string representation of `n` where every even-indexed character (starting from index 2) is equal to the first digit of `n` (`first_digit`), and every odd-indexed character (starting from index 3) is equal to the second digit of `n` (`second_digit`), `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, and `i` is equal to the length of `s`. If the loop does not execute due to `s` having a length less than 3, the original values of `n`, `s`, `first_digit`, and `second_digit` are retained.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer n, checks if its string representation has a length of at least 3, and if the first and second digits are different. Then it checks if every even-indexed digit (starting from index 2) is equal to the first digit, and every odd-indexed digit (starting from index 2) is equal to the second digit. If all these conditions are met, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
