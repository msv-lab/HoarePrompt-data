Based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(n)` correctly checks whether a given number is undulating or not by alternating between two digits. The annotated version of the code provides a clear step-by-step explanation of the program's state at different points, which confirms the original assessment.

The original assessment states that the function is correct, and it provides a detailed explanation of how the function works. The annotated version of the code supports this explanation, showing that the function correctly checks the length of the string representation of the number, the difference between the first two digits, and the alternation of the digits.

One potential issue with the function is that it returns True for numbers with a length of less than 3, such as 121, which may not be considered an undulating number by some definitions. However, the problem description does not explicitly state that an undulating number must have a length of at least 3, and the unit tests provided support the function's behavior in this case.

Therefore, based on the information available, I believe that the original assessment is accurate, and the function is correct.

Final: **True**
