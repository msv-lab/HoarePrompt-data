Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1(n)` that calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. This function uses the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients of a given power is equal to `2^(n-1)`.

To verify the correctness of this program, we need to understand the mathematical concept it is based on and test it with various inputs.

The formula for the sum of even index binomial coefficients is based on the Binomial Theorem, which states that `(x + y)^n = âˆ‘[k=0 to n] (n choose k) * x^(n-k) * y^k`. When `x = 1` and `y = 1`, the sum of all binomial coefficients is `2^n`. The sum of even index binomial coefficients can be found by taking the average of `(1 + 1)^n` and `(1 - 1)^n`, which simplifies to `(2^n + 0)/2 = 2^(n-1)`.

After analyzing the given code, it appears to correctly calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients using this mathematical property.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also support the correctness of the function:

- `func_1(4)` returns `8`, which is `2^(4-1) = 2^3 = 8`.
- `func_1(6)` returns `32`, which is `2^(6-1) = 2^5 = 32`.
- `func_1(2)` returns `2`, which is `2^(2-1) = 2^1 = 2`.

Since the code matches the mathematical property for the given test cases and does not contain any apparent logical errors or edge cases that it does not handle, it is considered correct.
