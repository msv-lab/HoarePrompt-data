The value of `sum` is updated by adding the result of `math.comb(n, i)`, where `n` is at least 2 and `i` is 2. The `math.comb(n, i)` function calculates the number of ways to choose `i` items from `n` items without repetition and without order. 

Given `i` is 2, `math.comb(n, i)` is equivalent to `math.comb(n, 2)`, which is equal to `n * (n - 1) / 2`. 

Therefore, `sum` becomes `sum + n * (n - 1) / 2`. 

Since the initial value of `sum` is not specified, we cannot determine its exact value after the update, but we can express it as `sum + n * (n - 1) / 2`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `sum` is `sum + n * (n - 1) / 2`**
