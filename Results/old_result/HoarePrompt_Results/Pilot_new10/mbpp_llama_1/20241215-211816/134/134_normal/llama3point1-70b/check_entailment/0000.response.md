Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` accurately calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:
1. The function uses the `math.comb(n, i)` function to calculate the binomial coefficient, which is a built-in function in Python that calculates the number of ways to choose `i` items from `n` items without repetition and without order.
2. It iterates over all possible values of `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) using a for loop.
3. Inside the loop, it checks if the current index `i` is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`. If `i` is even, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum.
4. Finally, it returns the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices.

This code correctly implements the problem description and handles all possible cases. The function works for any positive integer `n`, and it correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients. There are no obvious edge cases that the code does not handle, and it should work as expected for all valid inputs. 

For example, if we take `n = 3`, the function will calculate the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices as follows: 
- `math.comb(3, 0)` = 1 (even index 0)
- `math.comb(3, 2)` = 3 (even index 2)

The function will return `1 + 3 = 4`, which is the correct sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices for `n = 3`. 

Therefore, the code is correct, and it should work as expected for all valid inputs.
