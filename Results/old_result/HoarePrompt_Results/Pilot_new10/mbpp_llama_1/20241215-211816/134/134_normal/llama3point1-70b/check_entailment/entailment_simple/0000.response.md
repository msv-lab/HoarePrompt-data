Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The problem description asks to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`.
2. The program uses a loop to iterate over all possible indices `i` from 0 to `n` (inclusive) and checks if the index `i` is even by using the condition `i % 2 == 0`.
3. If the index `i` is even, it adds the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum.
4. The `math.comb(n, i)` function calculates the binomial coefficient, which is the number of ways to choose `i` items from a set of `n` items.
5. The program returns the sum of the even index binomial coefficients, which is the desired result according to the problem description.

The program correctly implements the problem description for every potential case. It handles the loop correctly, checks for even indices, and calculates the sum of the corresponding binomial coefficients.

Note: The comment in the program states that the sum is `2^(n-1)`, but this is not a requirement of the problem description. The program is correct because it calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients, regardless of whether the sum is `2^(n-1)` or not. In fact, the sum of even index binomial coefficients is indeed `2^(n-1)` for a positive integer `n`, which is a known mathematical property.
