Correctness: **False**

The given Python function `func_1` calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients by using the mathematical property that the sum of even index binomial coefficients of order `n` is equal to `2^(n-1)`. However, the function does not validate whether the input `n` is a positive integer. 

For instance, if `n` is a non-integer (e.g., `n = 3.5`), the function will still return a result, which may not be the expected behavior. Moreover, if `n` is a non-positive integer (e.g., `n = -1` or `n = 0`), the function will return an incorrect result or raise an exception.

To fix this, the function should include input validation to ensure that `n` is a positive integer, e.g., by using a conditional statement to check the type and value of `n`. 

For example, the function could be modified as follows:

```python
import math

def func_1(n):
    if not isinstance(n, int) or n <= 0:
        raise ValueError("n must be a positive integer")
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

With this modification, the function would correctly handle all potential cases and provide informative error messages for invalid inputs.
