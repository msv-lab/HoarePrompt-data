To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to understand what the problem description asks for and then check if the program fulfills this requirement.

The problem description requires writing a Python function that takes in a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

The sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given `n` can be directly calculated using the formula `2^(n-1)`, which is derived from the properties of binomial expansions and the symmetry of Pascal's triangle. The formula essentially represents the sum of all coefficients at even positions in the `n`-th row of Pascal's triangle, which corresponds to the binomial expansion of `(1+1)^n`.

Now, let's analyze the given program:

```python
import math

def func_1(n):
    return 2 ** (n - 1)
```

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns `2` raised to the power of `(n - 1)`. This directly corresponds to the mathematical formula for calculating the sum of even index binomial coefficients for any given positive integer `n`.

The provided assertions:

```python
assert func_1(4) == 8
assert func_1(6) == 32
assert func_1(2) == 2
```

also validate the function's correctness by comparing its output for specific inputs (`n = 4`, `n = 6`, and `n = 2`) with the expected results, which are derived from the sum of even index binomial coefficients for those values of `n`.

Given this analysis, the program indeed meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for any positive integer `n` using the formula `2^(n-1)`.

Correctness: **True**
