To verify the correctness of the given Python program, we need to understand what the problem description asks for and then compare it with what the program actually does.

The problem description requires a function that takes a positive integer `n` and finds the sum of even index binomial coefficients. In the context of binomial coefficients, the sum of even-indexed coefficients in the expansion of \((x + y)^n\) is given by \(2^{n-1}\) when we consider the expansion of \((1 + 1)^n\), because the coefficients of the even powers of \(x\) (or \(y\), depending on the perspective) in the binomial expansion of \((x + y)^n\) are summed and equate to \(2^{n-1}\) when \(x = 1\) and \(y = 1\).

Now, let's analyze the given program. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n` and returns \(2^{n-1}\). This directly aligns with the mathematical property related to the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients.

However, to fully align with the problem description, the function should also ensure that `n` is a positive integer, as specified. The function does not include any validation to check if `n` is indeed a positive integer, which might lead to unexpected results if `n` is not a positive integer.

Despite the lack of validation, from a mathematical perspective, the function `func_1(n)` = \(2^{n-1}\) is a correct representation of the sum of even-indexed binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The provided assertions with specific values of `n` also validate this for those cases.

Therefore, considering the mathematical aspect and the given problem description, the program is correct in terms of the calculation it performs for the intended purpose, but it could be improved with input validation to ensure `n` is a positive integer.

Correctness: **True** 

This conclusion is based on the mathematical correctness of the formula used and its alignment with the problem description's requirement, despite the omission of input validation.
