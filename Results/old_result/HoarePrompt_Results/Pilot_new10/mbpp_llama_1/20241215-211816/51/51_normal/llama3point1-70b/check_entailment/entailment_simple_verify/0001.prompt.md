You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
Program:
```
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input list is empty. If an empty list is passed to the function, it will raise a ZeroDivisionError because it tries to divide by the length of the list, which is 0. 

Additionally, the program does not handle the case when the list contains a 0. In this case, the product will be 0, but the function will still try to divide by the length of the list, resulting in 0. However, this might not be the expected behavior, as it does not actually calculate the product of the non-zero numbers in the list and then divide by the length.

The program also does not handle non-numeric values in the list. If a non-numeric value is in the list, it will raise a TypeError when it tries to multiply the product by the non-numeric value.

The program only handles the case when the list contains only numeric values and is not empty. 

Here's an example of an input that will cause the function to fail:
```python
print(func_1([]))  # Raises ZeroDivisionError
print(func_1([1, 2, 'a']))  # Raises TypeError
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers (either integers or floats), and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `numbers` is a list of numbers, `product` is the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the last number in the `numbers` list.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the average of all numbers in the list, which is calculated as the product of all numbers divided by the total count of numbers


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
