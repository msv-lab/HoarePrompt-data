The code `product *= num` multiplies the current value of `product` by `num` and assigns the result back to `product`. 

Given the initial state: 
- `numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 3 numbers.
- `product` is the product of the first two numbers in the `numbers` list.
- `num` is the third number in the `numbers` list.

The product of the first two numbers in the `numbers` list is `numbers[0] * numbers[1]`, and `num` is `numbers[2]`. 

After executing `product *= num`, `product` becomes `(numbers[0] * numbers[1]) * numbers[2]`, which simplifies to `numbers[0] * numbers[1] * numbers[2]`.

The state of `numbers` remains unchanged as it is a list of numbers with at least 3 numbers. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 3 numbers, `product` is equal to the product of the first three numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the third number in the `numbers` list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 3 numbers, `product` is `numbers[0] * numbers[1] * numbers[2]`, `num` is `numbers[2]`.**
