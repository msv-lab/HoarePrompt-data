Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input list is empty. If an empty list is passed to the function, it will raise a ZeroDivisionError because it tries to divide by the length of the list, which is 0. 

Additionally, the program does not handle the case when the list contains a 0. In this case, the product will be 0, but the function will still try to divide by the length of the list, resulting in 0. However, this might not be the expected behavior, as it does not actually calculate the product of the non-zero numbers in the list and then divide by the length.

The program also does not handle non-numeric values in the list. If a non-numeric value is in the list, it will raise a TypeError when it tries to multiply the product by the non-numeric value.

The program only handles the case when the list contains only numeric values and is not empty. 

Here's an example of an input that will cause the function to fail:
```python
print(func_1([]))  # Raises ZeroDivisionError
print(func_1([1, 2, 'a']))  # Raises TypeError
```
