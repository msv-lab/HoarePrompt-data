The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty list of numbers, which can be either integers or floats. It calculates the product of all numbers in the list and then divides this product by the total count of numbers in the list. However, this is not the definition of an average. The average of a list of numbers is calculated by summing all the numbers and then dividing by the total count of numbers, not by multiplying all the numbers and then dividing by the count.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears that the function does not correctly calculate the average of the numbers in the list as stated in the annotations. Instead, it calculates the product of all numbers and then divides by the count of numbers, which would result in a different value than the actual average.

Additionally, the function does not handle the case where the list contains a zero. If the list contains a zero, the product of all numbers will be zero, regardless of the other numbers in the list. However, this is still a result of the flawed calculation, not the correct average.

The function also does not handle potential edge cases such as an empty list, which would cause a ZeroDivisionError when trying to divide by the length of the list. However, according to the annotations, the list is not empty.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers, calculates the product of all numbers in the list, and returns this product divided by the total count of numbers, which is not the correct calculation for the average of the numbers in the list. **
