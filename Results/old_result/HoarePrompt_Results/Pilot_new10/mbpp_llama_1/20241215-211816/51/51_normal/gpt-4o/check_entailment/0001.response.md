Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide by the length of the list. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input.
2. It initializes a variable `product` to 1 and then iterates over each number in the input tuple, multiplying the `product` by the current number.
3. After calculating the product of all numbers, it divides the product by the length of the input tuple and returns the result.
4. The `math.isclose` assertions are used to verify the correctness of the function for certain test cases, considering a relative tolerance of 0.001 to account for potential floating-point precision issues.

The code handles various cases correctly, including:

* Positive numbers: The function correctly multiplies and divides the numbers.
* Negative numbers: The function correctly handles negative numbers, including the sign of the result.
* Mixed positive and negative numbers: The function correctly calculates the product and division.

No potential cases have been found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is considered correct.
