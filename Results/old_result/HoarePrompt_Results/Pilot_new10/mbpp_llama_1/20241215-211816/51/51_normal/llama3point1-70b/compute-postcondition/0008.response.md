To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet.

- `numbers` is a list of numbers.
- `product` is the product of all numbers in the `numbers` list.
- `num` is the last number in the `numbers` list.

The code snippet is `return product / len(numbers)`. 

Here, `product` is the product of all numbers in the list, and `len(numbers)` gives the total count of numbers in the list.

Given that `product` is the product of all numbers and `len(numbers)` is the count of all numbers in the list, the return statement calculates the average of the numbers in the list by dividing the product of all numbers by the total count of numbers.

Therefore, the program returns the average of all numbers in the `numbers` list.

Output State: **The program returns the average of all numbers in the list, which is calculated as the product of all numbers divided by the total count of numbers**
