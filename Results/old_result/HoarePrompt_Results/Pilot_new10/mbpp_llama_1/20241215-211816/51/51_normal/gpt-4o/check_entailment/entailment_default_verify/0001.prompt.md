You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
Program:
```
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((-10, -20, -30)), -2000.0, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((19, 15, 18)), 1710.0, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide by the length of the list. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of numbers as input.
2. It initializes a variable `product` to 1 and then iterates over each number in the input tuple, multiplying the `product` by the current number.
3. After calculating the product of all numbers, it divides the product by the length of the input tuple and returns the result.
4. The `math.isclose` assertions are used to verify the correctness of the function for certain test cases, considering a relative tolerance of 0.001 to account for potential floating-point precision issues.

The code handles various cases correctly, including:

* Positive numbers: The function correctly multiplies and divides the numbers.
* Negative numbers: The function correctly handles negative numbers, including the sign of the result.
* Mixed positive and negative numbers: The function correctly calculates the product and division.

No potential cases have been found where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers, calculates the product of all numbers in the list, and returns this product divided by the total count of numbers, which is not the correct calculation for the average of the numbers in the list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
