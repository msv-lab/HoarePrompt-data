The code `product *= num` updates the value of `product` by multiplying it with `num`. The initial state specifies that `numbers` is a list of numbers with at least 3 numbers, `product` is the product of the first two numbers in the `numbers` list, and `num` is the third number in the `numbers` list.

Given this, the new value of `product` is the old value of `product` (which is the product of the first two numbers in the `numbers` list) multiplied by `num` (which is the third number in the `numbers` list). Therefore, the new value of `product` can be expressed as the product of the first three numbers in the `numbers` list.

The states of `numbers` and `num` are not affected by the code, as `numbers` remains the list of numbers and `num` remains the third number in the list.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of numbers that must have at least 3 numbers, `product` is equal to the product of the first three numbers in the `numbers` list, `num` is the third number in the `numbers` list**
