Correctness: **True**

The code is correct as it accurately checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. Here's why:

- The function `func_1` first checks if the tuple is empty. If it is, the function returns `True` because an empty tuple can be considered to have all elements of the same type (vacuously true, as there are no elements).
- It then identifies the data type of the first element of the tuple (`first_type = type(tup[0])`).
- The code iterates over each element in the tuple. If any element's type (`type(element)`) does not match the type of the first element (`first_type`), the function immediately returns `False`, indicating not all elements have the same type.
- If the loop completes without finding any mismatch in types, the function returns `True`, confirming all elements in the tuple are of the same type.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) validate this behavior for various scenarios: 
- An all-integer tuple returns `True`.
- A tuple mixing integers and a string returns `False`.
- Another all-integer tuple returns `True`.

These tests cover basic functionality, and the code logic aligns with the problem description without any apparent gaps for edge cases, including handling empty tuples and tuples with single elements (which would also return `True` as there's only one type present).
