Correctness: **True**.

The code provided is a Python function named `func_1` that checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It uses the `set` function to create a set of the types of all elements in the tuple. If all elements have the same type, the set will contain only one element, which is the type of all elements.

The function handles tuples of any size and type composition correctly. It works for empty tuples (although it might be argued that an empty tuple has no type, the function will return `True` in this case), tuples with one element, and tuples with multiple elements.

For example, if we call `func_1((1, 2, 3))`, the function will correctly return `True` because all elements are integers. If we call `func_1((1, 2.0, 3))`, the function will correctly return `False` because the elements are of different types (int and float).

The function also handles tuples with elements of any type, including strings, lists, dictionaries, and more. It will return `True` if all elements are of the same type and `False` otherwise.

The output hints agree with the code and do not provide any cases where the code might not work as expected. Therefore, we can conclude that the code is correct for every potential case.
