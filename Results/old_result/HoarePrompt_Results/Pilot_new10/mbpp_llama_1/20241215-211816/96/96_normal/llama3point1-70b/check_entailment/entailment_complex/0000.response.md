Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(tup)` takes a tuple as input and returns `True` if all elements in the tuple are of the same type, and `False` otherwise.

Here's why it works:

1. The `set(type(x) for x in tup)` expression generates a set of the types of all elements in the tuple. This means that if all elements are of the same type, the set will contain only one element (that type).

2. The `len()` function then counts the number of elements in this set. If the count is 1, it means that all elements in the tuple are of the same type, so the function returns `True`.

3. If the count is greater than 1, it means that there are elements of different types in the tuple, so the function returns `False`.

This program handles tuples of any size and type composition correctly, because it uses a set to store the types, which automatically eliminates duplicates. This means that it will work correctly for tuples with any number of elements, and for tuples containing elements of any type, including but not limited to integers, floats, strings, lists, dictionaries, etc.

For example, the function will return:

- `True` for the tuple `(1, 2, 3)` because all elements are integers.
- `True` for the tuple `('a', 'b', 'c')` because all elements are strings.
- `False` for the tuple `(1, 'a', 3.0)` because the elements are of different types (integer, string, and float).

Overall, the program accurately implements the functionality described in the problem description, so it is correct.
