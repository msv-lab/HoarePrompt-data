Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(tup)` correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. It uses a set comprehension to generate a set of the types of all elements in the tuple, and then checks if the length of this set is 1. If it is, that means all elements have the same type, because a set in Python cannot contain duplicate values.

Here's a breakdown of why this function works correctly:

- It handles tuples of any size, including empty tuples. In the case of an empty tuple, `len(set((type(x) for x in tup)))` would be 0, not 1, correctly indicating that not all elements have the same type (since there are no elements).
- It correctly identifies tuples where all elements are of the same type, regardless of what that type is (e.g., integers, strings, floats).
- It also correctly identifies tuples where elements have different types, returning `False` as expected.

Since the function handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement without any exceptions or incorrect results, it is considered correct.
