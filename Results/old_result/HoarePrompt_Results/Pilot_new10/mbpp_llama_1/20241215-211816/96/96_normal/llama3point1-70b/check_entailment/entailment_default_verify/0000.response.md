The original assessment is "None", which implies that there is no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. 

To determine the final correctness of the program, we need to review the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints.

The problem description asks to write a function to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that uses a generator expression to get the type of each element in the tuple, converts the types to a set (which removes duplicates), and checks if the length of the set is 1. If it is, that means all elements in the tuple have the same type, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The output hints indicate that the function `func_1` correctly handles tuples of any size and type composition, returning `True` if all elements are of the same type and `False` otherwise.

Based on the code review, the code correctly implements the problem description. It checks the type of each element in the tuple and returns `True` if all elements are of the same type and `False` otherwise. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected.

Therefore, the final assessment is that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
