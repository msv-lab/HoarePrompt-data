The original assessment is None, which means there is no information about the correctness of the program. However, based on the problem description and the provided code, we can assess the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks to write a function to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type or not. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and returns `True` if all elements in `tup` are of the same type, `False` otherwise.

The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` behaves as expected, handling tuples of any size and type composition. The code uses a set comprehension to create a set of types of all elements in the tuple, and then checks if the length of this set is 1. If the length is 1, it means all elements have the same type, so the function returns `True`. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

This approach is correct because a set in Python cannot contain duplicate elements, so if all elements in the tuple have the same type, the set will contain only one type.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
