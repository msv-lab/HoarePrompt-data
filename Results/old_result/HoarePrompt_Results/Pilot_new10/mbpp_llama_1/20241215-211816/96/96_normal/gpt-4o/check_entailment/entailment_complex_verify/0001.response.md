To determine the final correctness of the program based on the problem description, let's analyze the original assessment, the provided code, and the annotated version.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type or not.
2. **Original Assessment**: None
3. **Provided Code**: The function `func_1(tup)` checks if all elements in the tuple `tup` are of the same type. It does this by first checking if the tuple is empty, in which case it returns `True`. Then, it determines the type of the first element and checks each subsequent element against this type. If it finds an element with a different type, it immediately returns `False`. If it checks all elements without finding any of a different type, it returns `True`.
4. **Annotated Code**: The annotations in the code provide a step-by-step explanation of what the function does and the state of the program at different points. It correctly explains how the function handles empty tuples and tuples with elements of the same or different types.

Given that the original assessment is "None," there is no prior evaluation to agree or disagree with. However, based on the problem description and the provided code, the function seems to correctly implement the required functionality:

- It correctly handles the case where the tuple is empty.
- It correctly identifies tuples where all elements are of the same type.
- It correctly identifies tuples where not all elements are of the same type.

The annotated version of the code reinforces this understanding by walking through the logic step by step.

**Conclusion**: The program is correct according to the problem description. It properly checks if all elements in a tuple are of the same data type and returns `True` if they are, and `False` otherwise, including handling the edge case of an empty tuple.

Final: **True**
