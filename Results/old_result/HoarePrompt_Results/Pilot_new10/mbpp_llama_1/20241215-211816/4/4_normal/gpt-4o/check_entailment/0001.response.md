Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(a, b)` checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. The function uses the XOR operation (`a ^ b`) to find the bits that are different between the two numbers. The result of the XOR operation is then checked against two conditions: 

1. `xor_result!= 0`: This ensures that there is at least one bit difference between the two numbers. If there were no differences, the XOR result would be zero.

2. `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`: This is a trick to check if the number is a power of 2. In binary, a power of 2 has exactly one 1 bit and all other bits are 0. When you subtract 1 from a power of 2, you get a number with all bits to the right of the first 1 set to 1 and the first 1 set to 0. For example, if you have `1000` (8 in decimal) and subtract 1, you get `0111` (7 in decimal). When you do a bitwise AND operation (`&`) between these two numbers, you get zero.

Since the XOR result must be a power of 2 to fulfill the second condition, this implies that there is only one bit difference between the two numbers, which is exactly what the problem description requires. 

All the provided unit tests (`assert` statements) pass with the given function, which further supports the correctness of the function. Without a specific counterexample or an edge case where this function fails, it can be concluded that the function works as expected based on the problem description.
