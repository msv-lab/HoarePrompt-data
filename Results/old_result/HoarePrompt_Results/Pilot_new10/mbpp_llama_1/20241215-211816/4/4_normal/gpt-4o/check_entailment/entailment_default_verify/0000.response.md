The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only by using bitwise operations. The function first calculates the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`, then checks if the result is not zero and if it is a power of 2. This logic covers all potential edge cases correctly, as explained in the original assessment.

The output hints also support the original assessment. They state that the function returns `True` if the XOR result is a non-zero power of 2, which aligns with the logic explained in the original assessment.

There are no apparent cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness, and the output hints confirm that the function behaves as intended.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
