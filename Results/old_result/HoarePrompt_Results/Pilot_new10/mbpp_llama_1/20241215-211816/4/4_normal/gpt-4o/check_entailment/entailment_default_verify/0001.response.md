The original assessment is accurate. The provided Python function `func_1(a, b)` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at one bit position only or not. The function uses the XOR operation (`a ^ b`) to find the bits that are different between the two numbers, and then checks the result against two conditions: 

1. `xor_result!= 0`: This ensures that there is at least one bit difference between the two numbers. 

2. `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`: This checks if the number is a power of 2, which implies that there is only one bit difference between the two numbers.

The output hints provided confirm that the function works as expected, returning `True` if the XOR result is a non-zero power of 2 and `False` otherwise. This behavior aligns with the problem description.

Given that the function correctly implements the required logic, passes the provided unit tests, and aligns with the output hints, it can be concluded that the original assessment of the function's correctness is accurate.

Final: **True**
