The given Python code is `xor_result = a ^ b`. This code calculates the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b` and assigns the result to `xor_result`.

The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are integers. After executing the code, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged because the XOR operation does not modify its operands. A new variable, `xor_result`, is introduced, which holds the result of the XOR operation between `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged integers `a` and `b`, along with the new variable `xor_result`, which is equal to `a ^ b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers, `xor_result` is equal to `a ^ b`**
