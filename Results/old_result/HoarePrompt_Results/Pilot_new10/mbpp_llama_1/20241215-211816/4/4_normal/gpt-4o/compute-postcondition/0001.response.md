To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

```python
return xor_result!= 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0
```

Given that `xor_result` is equal to `a ^ b`, where `a` and `b` are integers, we need to understand what the expression `xor_result!= 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` evaluates to.

1. `xor_result!= 0`: This condition checks if the XOR result of `a` and `b` is not equal to 0. The XOR operation (`^`) compares each bit of the first operand to the corresponding bit of the second operand. If one bit is 0 and the other bit is 1, the corresponding result bit is set to 1. Otherwise, the corresponding result bit is set to 0. For `xor_result` to be not equal to 0, `a` and `b` must have at least one bit that is different.

2. `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`: This condition checks if `xor_result` is a power of 2. In binary representation, powers of 2 have exactly one bit set to 1 (the bit in the place that corresponds to that power of 2), and all other bits set to 0. When you subtract 1 from a power of 2, you get a number that has all the bits to the right of the first 1 set to 1, and all other bits set to 0. Therefore, a bitwise AND operation (`&`) between a power of 2 and the number one less than it will result in 0, because there are no bits that are 1 in both numbers.

Given these conditions, the expression `xor_result!= 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` will be `True` if `xor_result` is a power of 2 (and not zero), and `False` otherwise.

Since `xor_result` is the result of `a ^ b`, and we know that `a` and `b` are integers, the program returns `True` if the XOR of `a` and `b` is a power of 2 (excluding 0), and `False` otherwise.

Output State: **The program returns True if the XOR of `a` and `b` is a non-zero power of 2, and False otherwise.**
