Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because the XOR operation (`a ^ b`) yields a result where each bit is set only if the corresponding bits in `a` and `b` differ. The condition `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` checks if the XOR result is a power of 2. This is a property of powers of 2 in binary representation, where exactly one bit is set (the bit in the place that corresponds to that power of 2). 

The condition `xor_result!= 0` ensures that `a` and `b` must differ in at least one bit position. 

Therefore, the code correctly checks whether `a` and `b` differ in exactly one bit position, as required by the problem description. All the provided unit tests also pass, which further supports the correctness of the code. 

Note that this solution leverages the fact that XORing two numbers and then checking if the result is a non-zero power of 2 is equivalent to checking if the two numbers differ by exactly one bit. This is because the binary representation of powers of 2 have exactly one '1' bit and all other bits are '0'. This property makes the code efficient and correct for all possible inputs.
