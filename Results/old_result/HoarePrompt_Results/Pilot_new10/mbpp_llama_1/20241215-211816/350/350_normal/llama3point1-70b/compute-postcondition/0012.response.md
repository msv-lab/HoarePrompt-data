The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `target`. `arr` is a sorted list of elements, and `target` is an element that may be present in `arr`. The function returns different values based on the following conditions: 

1. If the `target` is found at the last index of the sorted list `arr`, the function returns the last index of `arr`.
2. If the `target` is not found at the last index but the second last index of the sorted list `arr`, the function returns the second last index of `arr`.
3. If the `target` is not found at the last or second last index but at the third last index of the sorted list `arr`, which has at least 3 elements, the function returns the third last index of `arr`.
4. If none of the above conditions are met, indicating the `target` element is not found in the sorted list `arr`, the function returns -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list `arr` and a `target` element, then return the index of the `target` in `arr` based on specific conditions, or -1 if the `target` is not found.

Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list `arr` and a `target` element, then returns the index of the `target` in `arr` if found at specific positions, otherwise returns -1.**
