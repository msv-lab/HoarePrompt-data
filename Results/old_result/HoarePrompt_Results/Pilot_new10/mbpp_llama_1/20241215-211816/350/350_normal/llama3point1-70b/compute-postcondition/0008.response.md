To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the code snippet. 

The initial state provides us with the following information:
- `arr` is a sorted list of elements with at least 2 elements.
- `target` is an element that may be present in `arr`.
- `i` is the third last index of `arr`.

Given that `arr` has at least 2 elements, and considering it's sorted, the actual values or the nature of the elements in `arr` aren't specified, but we know `arr` has a structure that can be indexed.

The code snippet given is `return i`, which simply returns the value of `i`. Since `i` is defined as the third last index of `arr`, we need to understand what this implies in terms of indexing.

In Python, indexing starts at 0. So, if `arr` has `n` elements, the last index is `n-1`, the second last index is `n-2`, and the third last index is `n-3`. Therefore, `i` is equal to `n-3`, where `n` is the number of elements in `arr`.

However, the exact value of `i` depends on the length of `arr`. Since we're not given the exact length of `arr` but know it has at least 2 elements, and `i` is the third last index, `arr` must have at least 3 elements for `i` to be a valid index.

Thus, when the program returns `i`, it returns the index of the third last element in `arr`. Without knowing the exact length of `arr`, we cannot determine the exact numerical value of `i`, but we know it refers to a specific position in the sorted list `arr`.

Output State: **The program returns the third last index of the sorted list `arr`, which has at least 3 elements.**
