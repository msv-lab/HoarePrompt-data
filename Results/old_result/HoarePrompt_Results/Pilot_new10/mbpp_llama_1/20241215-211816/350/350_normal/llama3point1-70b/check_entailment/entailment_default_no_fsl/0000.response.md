Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates over the array from the last element to the first, and as soon as it finds a match with the target element, it returns the index of that element. If it iterates over the entire array without finding a match, it returns -1, indicating that the target element is not present in the array.

The function handles all potential cases, including:

* The target element is present in the array: The function correctly returns the index of the last occurrence of the target element.
* The target element is not present in the array: The function correctly returns -1.
* The array is empty: The function correctly returns -1, since there are no elements to search.
* The target element is the first and last element in the array: The function correctly returns the index of the last occurrence of the target element, which is the same as the index of the first occurrence.

The output hints provided agree with the code's functionality, and there are no edge cases that the code does not handle correctly. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
