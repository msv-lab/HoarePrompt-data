You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is a Python function that finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array from the end to the start, and as soon as it finds the target element, it returns its index. If the target element is not found in the array, it returns -1.

This program works correctly for every potential case. Here are a few examples:

- If the target element is present in the array, the function returns its last index. For example, if `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]` and `target = 2`, the function returns `2`.
- If the target element is not present in the array, the function returns -1. For example, if `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 4]` and `target = 5`, the function returns `-1`.
- If the target element is present at the end of the array, the function returns its correct index. For example, if `arr = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3]` and `target = 3`, the function returns `4`.
- If the array is empty, the function does not throw an error but instead returns -1. For example, if `arr = []` and `target = 5`, the function returns `-1`.

The function's time complexity is O(n), where n is the length of the array, because in the worst case, it needs to iterate through the entire array. The function's space complexity is O(1), which means it uses constant space, as it only uses a fixed amount of space to store the variables and does not use any data structures that grow with the size of the input array.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality to find the last position of an element in a sorted array, and it handles all edge cases correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a sorted list `arr` and a `target` element, then returns the index of the last occurrence of the `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise returns -1, handling the case where the target is not present or the list is empty

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
