The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The program iterates through the array from the end to the start, and as soon as it finds the target element, it returns its index, which is the last occurrence of the target element in the sorted array. 

The output hints also support the original assessment, as they describe the function's behavior as returning the index of the last occurrence of the target element in the sorted list if found, and -1 otherwise, including the cases where the target is not present or the list is empty.

The provided code handles all the mentioned cases correctly:
- If the target element is present in the array, the function returns its last index.
- If the target element is not present in the array, the function returns -1.
- If the target element is present at the end of the array, the function returns its correct index.
- If the array is empty, the function returns -1.

The time complexity of O(n) and space complexity of O(1) also seem to be correct, as the function iterates through the array at most once and uses a constant amount of space to store the variables.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, the original assessment seems to be accurate.

Final: **True**
