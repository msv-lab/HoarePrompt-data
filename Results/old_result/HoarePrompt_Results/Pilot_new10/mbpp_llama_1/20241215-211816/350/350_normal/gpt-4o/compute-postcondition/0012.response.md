The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `x`. `arr` is a sorted list of elements, and `x` is an element that may or may not be present in `arr`. After executing the function body, the function returns different values based on the following conditions: 
If `x` is equal to the last element of `arr`, the function returns the last index of `arr`. 
If this condition is not met, but `x` is equal to the second last element of `arr`, the function returns the index of the second last element. 
If neither of the above conditions is met, but `x` is equal to the third last element of `arr`, the function returns the index of the third last element. 
If none of the above conditions are met, or if the list `arr` is empty, the function returns -1, indicating that the element `x` was not found in the sorted list `arr`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list `arr` and an element `x`, and return the index of `x` if it matches the last, second last, or third last element of `arr`; otherwise, it returns -1.
Functionality: **The function accepts a sorted list `arr` and an element `x`, and returns the index of `x` if it matches the last, second last, or third last element of `arr`; otherwise, it returns -1.**
