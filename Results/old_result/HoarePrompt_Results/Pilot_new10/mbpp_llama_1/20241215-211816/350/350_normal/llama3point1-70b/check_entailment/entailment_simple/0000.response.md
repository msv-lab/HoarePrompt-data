To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step in relation to the task it's supposed to accomplish.

The problem description asks for a function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The given Python function, `func_1`, iterates over the array in reverse order. When it encounters an element that matches the target, it immediately returns the index of that element. If the loop completes without finding the target, the function returns -1, indicating that the target element is not present in the array.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Reverse Iteration**: The function iterates over the array in reverse order. This is crucial for finding the last occurrence of an element because as soon as it finds a match, it can return that index, knowing it's the last one due to the reverse iteration.

2. **Immediate Return on Match**: The function returns the index as soon as it finds a match. This ensures that it returns the index of the last occurrence of the target element in the array because it started searching from the end.

3. **Handling Not Found Case**: If the target element is not found after iterating over the entire array, the function correctly returns -1. This is a common convention to indicate that an element was not found in a list or array.

However, there's a minor annotation mistake in the provided code. The comment after the for loop mentions that the function returns `None` if `target` is not found, but the actual code returns `-1`. While both could be considered valid indicators of an element not being found, the code and comments should ideally match for clarity.

Given the actual functionality and typical conventions in programming, returning `-1` to indicate an element is not found is common and clear. Therefore, despite the minor discrepancy in the comments, the program itself is correct in its implementation to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.

**Correctness: True**
