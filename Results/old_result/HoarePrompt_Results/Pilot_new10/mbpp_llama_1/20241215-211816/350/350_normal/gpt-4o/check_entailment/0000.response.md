Correctness: **True**.

The given program is correct because it iterates through the sorted array from right to left and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target element it finds, which is effectively the last position of the element in the array since the array is sorted.

This approach ensures that the function finds the last position of the target element, as required by the problem description. The function also returns -1 if the target element is not found in the array, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs, including cases where the target element appears multiple times in the array and cases where the target element does not appear at all.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of why the code works:

1.  The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a sorted array `arr` and a target element `x`.
2.  It iterates through the array from right to left using a for loop with `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`.
3.  Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the target element `x`.
4.  If a match is found, it immediately returns the index `i` of the matching element, which is the last position of the target element due to the right-to-left iteration.
5.  If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns -1 to indicate that the target element is not present in the array.

Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
