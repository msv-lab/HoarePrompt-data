You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3], 1) == 0
assert func_1([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1) == 2
assert func_1([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3) == 3

def func_1(arr, x):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == x:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program is correct because it iterates through the sorted array from right to left and returns the index of the first occurrence of the target element it finds, which is effectively the last position of the element in the array since the array is sorted.

This approach ensures that the function finds the last position of the target element, as required by the problem description. The function also returns -1 if the target element is not found in the array, which is the correct behavior according to the problem description.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate that the function works correctly for various inputs, including cases where the target element appears multiple times in the array and cases where the target element does not appear at all.

Here is a step-by-step breakdown of why the code works:

1.  The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a sorted array `arr` and a target element `x`.
2.  It iterates through the array from right to left using a for loop with `range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1)`.
3.  Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `arr[i]` is equal to the target element `x`.
4.  If a match is found, it immediately returns the index `i` of the matching element, which is the last position of the target element due to the right-to-left iteration.
5.  If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns -1 to indicate that the target element is not present in the array.

Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a sorted list `arr` and an element `x`, and returns the index of `x` if it is found in `arr` while iterating from the end towards the beginning; otherwise, it returns -1, indicating that `x` was not found in `arr` or `arr` is empty.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
