Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of elements with at least 2 elements, `target` is an element that may be present in `arr`, and `i` is the third last index of `arr`. If `arr` at index `i` is equal to `target`, the function returns the third last index of `arr`. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged as there are no additional operations specified in the else part.***
