The original assessment is "None", meaning that no initial assessment was provided. To determine the final correctness of the program, we will analyze the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code.

The problem description requires writing a Python function to check whether all characters in a given string are the same or not.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and checks if all characters are the same. It first checks if the string is empty, in which case it returns `True`. Then, it iterates over each character in the string and checks if it is equal to the first character. If it finds a character that is not equal to the first character, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the iteration without finding any such character, it returns `True`.

The annotated version of the code provides additional information about the state of the program at different points. It confirms that the function behaves as expected: it returns `True` for an empty string, and for a non-empty string, it checks if all characters are the same.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, the function `func_1` correctly implements the required behavior. It handles the edge case of an empty string and correctly identifies strings with all same characters.

The original assessment was "None", which means no initial judgment was made. After analyzing the code and its annotation, it's clear that the function is implemented correctly according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
