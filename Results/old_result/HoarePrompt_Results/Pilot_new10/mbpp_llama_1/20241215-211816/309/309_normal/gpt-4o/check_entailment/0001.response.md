Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program checks whether all characters in a given string are the same. The function `func_1(s)` iterates over each character in the string and compares it with the first character. If it finds a character that is different from the first character, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates over the entire string without finding any different characters, it returns `True`. 

The edge case where the input string is empty is also correctly handled, as the function returns `True` in this case. This is reasonable because there are no characters in an empty string that could be different from each other.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1('python') == False`, `assert func_1('aaa') == True`, and `assert func_1('data') == False`, also pass with the given function. 

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, therefore I conclude that the program is correct.
