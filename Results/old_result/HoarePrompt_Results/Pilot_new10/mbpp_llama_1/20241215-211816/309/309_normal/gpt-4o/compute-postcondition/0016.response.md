The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. `s` is a string. After executing the function body, the function returns `True` in Case_1 and Case_5, and `False` in Case_2, Case_3, and Case_4. Since the problem doesn't specify the conditions for each case, we can only describe the functionality of the function in general terms.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter s, returns `True` in certain cases and `False` in other cases, dependent on the conditions for each case, which are not provided.**
