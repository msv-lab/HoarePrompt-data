The original assessment is None, meaning there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. 

Given the problem description, the program, and the annotated version, we can assess the program's correctness. The problem asks to write a Python function to check whether all characters in a string are the same or not. The provided program defines a function `func_1(s)` that takes a string `s` as input and returns `True` if all characters in the string are the same and `False` otherwise.

The annotated version of the code indicates that the function returns `True` if all characters in the string `s` are the same and `False` otherwise. This aligns with the problem description. 

The function uses the `set(s)` function to create a set of unique characters in the string. If all characters are the same, the set will contain only one character, and `len(set(s))` will return 1. Therefore, the function correctly checks whether all characters in the string are the same.

Based on this analysis, the original assessment of None can be updated to reflect that the program is correct. The annotated version of the code supports this conclusion, as it provides a clear explanation of the function's behavior.

Final: **True**
