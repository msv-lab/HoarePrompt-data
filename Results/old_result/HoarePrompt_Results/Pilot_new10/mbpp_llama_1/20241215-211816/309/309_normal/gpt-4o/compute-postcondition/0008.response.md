According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has at least one more character after the current character, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is `s[0]`, `char` is `s[0]` or the same as `first_char`, and `char` is equal to `first_char`. This means the loop has just started or `char` has not changed. So for the loop to execute one more time, `char` should be the next character in `s`.
State: **`s` is a string with at least two characters, `first_char` is `s[0]`, `char` is `s[1]`**
