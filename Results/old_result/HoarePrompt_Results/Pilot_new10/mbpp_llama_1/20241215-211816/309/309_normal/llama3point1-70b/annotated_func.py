#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
    #The program returns True if all characters in string `s` are the same, False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if all characters in `s` are the same (including the case where `s` has only one character), and `False` otherwise, including the case where `s` is an empty string. It assumes `s` is a string and does not handle cases where `s` might be `None` or a non-string type.
