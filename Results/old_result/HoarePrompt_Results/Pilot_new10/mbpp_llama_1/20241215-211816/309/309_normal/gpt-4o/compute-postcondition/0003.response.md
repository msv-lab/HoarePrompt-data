The code assigns the first character of the string `s` to the variable `first_char`. Since `s` is not empty, `s[0]` will be the first character of the string. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, and `s` is not empty; `first_char` is the first character of string `s`, i.e., `s[0]`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, and `s` is not empty; `first_char` is `s[0]`.**
