#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])
    #The program returns a string consisting of characters from `s` that are at even indices (0-based indexing)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s`, returns a string consisting of characters from `s` that are at even indices (0-based indexing), and handles strings of any length, including empty strings, but may raise errors for non-string inputs or if the input is `None`.
