Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function, `func_1`, correctly removes the characters at odd index values from a given string. This is because Python uses zero-based indexing, where the first character of a string is at index 0, the second character is at index 1, and so on. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the string, selecting only the characters at even indices (`i % 2 == 0`) and joining them together into a new string.

The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1('abcdef') == 'ace'` and `assert func_1('python') == 'pto'`, demonstrate the function's correct behavior for various input strings. The function's logic is straightforward and aligns with the problem description, making it correct for all potential cases.

In every case, the function will return a string containing only the characters at even indices from the original string, effectively removing the characters at odd indices. Since the function works as intended and there are no apparent edge cases that it does not handle correctly, its correctness is confirmed.
