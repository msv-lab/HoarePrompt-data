Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(s)` removes the characters which have odd index values of a given string. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the string `s` with a step of 2, effectively selecting only the characters at even index positions. 

In Python, the indexing of strings is zero-based, meaning that the first character is at index 0, the second character is at index 1, and so on. The characters at odd index positions are skipped by the `range(0, len(s), 2)` function, which generates indices starting from 0 up to `len(s)` with a step size of 2. 

As a result, the function correctly removes all characters that have odd index values from the string. 

Here are a few examples that illustrate the correctness of the function:
- If you have the string "abcdef", the function will return "ace", which are the characters at the even indices (0, 2, 4).
- If you have the string "Hello World", the function will return "Hl Wrld", which are the characters at the even indices.

Since we cannot find any potential case where the code does not work as expected according to the problem description, the function is considered correct.
