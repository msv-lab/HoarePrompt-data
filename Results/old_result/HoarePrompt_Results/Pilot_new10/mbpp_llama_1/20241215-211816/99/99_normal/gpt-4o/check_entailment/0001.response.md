Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function, `func_1`, is designed to remove characters at odd index values from a given string. The function utilizes list comprehension to iterate over the string `s` and includes characters at even index values (`i % 2 == 0`) in the output string. 

This function works as expected because Python uses zero-based indexing, meaning the first character is at index 0 (even), the second character is at index 1 (odd), and so on. The function correctly filters out characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.) and only includes characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, etc.) in the resulting string.

The unit tests provided (`assert` statements) cover various string lengths and edge cases, and all of them pass with the given implementation. Without being able to find a counterexample where the function does not work as described, it's reasonable to conclude that the function is correct for all potential input cases.
