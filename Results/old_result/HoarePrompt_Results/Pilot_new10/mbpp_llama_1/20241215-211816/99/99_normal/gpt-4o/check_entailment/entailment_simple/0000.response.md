Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string consisting of characters from `s` that are at even indices (0-based indexing). This effectively removes the characters at odd index values from the original string.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the indices of the input string `s`.
2. The `if i % 2 == 0` condition filters out the indices that are odd, only keeping the indices that are even (i.e., 0, 2, 4,...).
3. The `s[i]` expression extracts the character at each even index `i`.
4. The `''.join(...)` method concatenates the extracted characters into a new string, which is then returned by the function.

This implementation correctly removes the characters at odd index values from the original string, as specified in the problem description.

For example, if the input string is `'abcdef'`, the function will extract the characters at indices 0, 2, and 4, resulting in the output string `'ace'`. Similarly, if the input string is `'python'`, the function will extract the characters at indices 0, 2, and 4, resulting in the output string `'pto'`.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also demonstrate the correctness of the function for various input cases. Overall, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore correct.
