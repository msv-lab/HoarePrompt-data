#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join(s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2))
    #The program returns a string consisting of characters at even indices from string `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string consisting of characters from `s` that are at even indices, handling all cases including empty strings, single-character strings, and strings of varying lengths.
