Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an element, then uses the built-in `all` function in combination with a generator expression to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element.

Here's a breakdown of why this function works as expected:

1. The `all` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true. If at least one element is false, it returns `False`.

2. The generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` generates a sequence of boolean values, where each value is `True` if the corresponding item in the list is equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise.

3. By combining `all` with the generator expression, the function will return `True` only if all items in the list are equal to the given element, which perfectly meets the problem description.

To verify the correctness of this function, we can consider various test cases:

- An empty list: `func_1([], 5)` returns `True` because the `all` function returns `True` for an empty iterable. This aligns with the problem description since there are no items in the list that are not equal to the given element.

- A list with all items equal to the given element: `func_1([5, 5, 5], 5)` returns `True`, which is correct.

- A list with not all items equal to the given element: `func_1([5, 3, 5], 5)` returns `False`, which is also correct.

Since the function handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description, it is deemed correct.
