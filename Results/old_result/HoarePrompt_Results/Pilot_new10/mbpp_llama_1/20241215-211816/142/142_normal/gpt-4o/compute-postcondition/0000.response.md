To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement. The loop iterates over each item in `lst`. For the loop to execute, `lst` must not be empty, meaning it must have at least one item. The variable `item` will take the value of the first element in `lst` at the start of the loop. The presence of `element` suggests it will be used for comparison within the loop, but its specific value or relation to the items in `lst` isn't crucial for the loop to start executing.

State: **`lst` is a list that must have at least one item, `item` is the first item in `lst`, `element` is an object that can be compared to the elements in `lst`**
