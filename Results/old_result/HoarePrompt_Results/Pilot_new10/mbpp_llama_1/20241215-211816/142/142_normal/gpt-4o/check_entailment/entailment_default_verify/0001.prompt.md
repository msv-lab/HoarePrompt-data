You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue') == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4], 7) == False
assert func_1(['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green') == True

def func_1(lst, element):
    for item in lst:
        if item != element:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it meets the requirements described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks whether all items in the input list are equal to the given element. It uses a simple and efficient approach by iterating through each item in the list and comparing it to the given element. If it finds any item that does not match the given element, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any mismatches, it returns `True`.

This program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- An empty list: Although not explicitly tested, if an empty list were passed to the function, it would correctly return `True` for any element, because there are no items in the list that are not equal to the given element.
- A list with a single element: The function will correctly return `True` if the single element matches the given element and `False` otherwise.
- A list with multiple elements: As demonstrated by the provided unit tests, the function correctly returns `True` only when all elements in the list are equal to the given element and `False` otherwise.

The function's logic is straightforward and comprehensive, covering all possible scenarios without any apparent gaps or edge cases that it does not handle correctly. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the analysis of the program's behavior, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`, returns `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element` or if `lst` is empty, and returns `False` otherwise.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
