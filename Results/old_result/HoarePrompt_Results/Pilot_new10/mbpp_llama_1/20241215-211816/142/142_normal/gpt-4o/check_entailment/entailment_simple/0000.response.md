Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

- The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `lst` (a list) and `element` (any type of object that can be compared to the elements in the list).
- It iterates over each `item` in `lst` and checks if `item` is not equal to `element`. If it finds any such `item`, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that not all items in the list are equal to the given `element`.
- If the function iterates through the entire list without finding any item not equal to `element`, it returns `True`, indicating that all items in the list are indeed equal to the given `element`.
- This logic covers all possible cases:
  - An empty list would result in the function returning `True` because the condition to return `False` is never met (since there are no items to compare).
  - A list with all elements equal to the given element returns `True`.
  - A list with at least one element not equal to the given element returns `False`.

The program's logic aligns perfectly with the problem description's requirements. It correctly handles lists of any size, with any type of comparable elements, and returns the expected result based on the comparison with the given element. Therefore, the program is correct according to the provided problem description.
