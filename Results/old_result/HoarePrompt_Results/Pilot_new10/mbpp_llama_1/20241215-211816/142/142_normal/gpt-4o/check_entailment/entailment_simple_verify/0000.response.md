The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. It handles cases where all elements match, where not all elements match, and implicitly handles the case of an empty list.

The annotated version of the code also supports this assessment. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program at different points, and they do not reveal any issues with the original assessment.

The reason the original assessment is accurate is that it correctly identifies the function's behavior in different scenarios, including all elements matching, not all elements matching, and the implicit handling of an empty list. The function's implementation is also consistent with the problem description, and the provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the code, the final correctness of the program is:

Final: **True**.
