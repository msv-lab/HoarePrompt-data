The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `lst` and `element`, where `lst` is a list and `element` is any type of object that can be compared to the elements in the list.

Analyzing the code line by line, the function iterates over each item in `lst` using a for loop. Inside the loop, it checks if the current item is not equal to `element`. If it finds such an item, it immediately returns `False`. 

If the loop completes without finding any item not equal to `element`, the function returns `True`, indicating that all items in `lst` are equal to `element`. 

However, there's an implicit case that the annotations partially touch upon but do not fully address: the case when `lst` is empty. In Python, if a for loop is given an empty iterable (like an empty list), it will simply not execute the loop body at all and will move on to the next statement. Therefore, if `lst` is empty, the function will not enter the loop and will directly return `True`, because there are no items in `lst` that are not equal to `element`.

Thus, considering all potential cases, including the edge case where `lst` is empty, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and an `element`, returns `True` if all items in `lst` are equal to `element` or if `lst` is empty, and returns `False` otherwise. **
