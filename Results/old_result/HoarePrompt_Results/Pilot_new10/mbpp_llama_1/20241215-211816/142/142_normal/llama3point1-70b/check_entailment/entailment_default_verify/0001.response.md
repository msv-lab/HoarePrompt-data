The original assessment seems accurate based on the provided code and problem description. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element, handling cases such as an empty list, a list with all items equal to the element, and a list with not all items equal to the element.

The output hints also align with the expected functionality of the code, indicating that the function returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the element or if the list is empty, and `False` otherwise.

The provided Python function utilizes the built-in `all` function in combination with a generator expression to efficiently check the condition, and it does so without any apparent errors or edge cases that would contradict the problem description or the output hints.

Given that the input is assumed to be valid (i.e., a list and an element), and considering the function handles empty lists and lists with all or some elements equal to the given element correctly, there is no evidence to suggest that the original assessment of correctness is inaccurate.

Final: **True**
