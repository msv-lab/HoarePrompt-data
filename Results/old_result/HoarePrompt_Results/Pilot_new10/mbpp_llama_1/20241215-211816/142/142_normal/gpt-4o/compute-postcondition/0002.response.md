The code snippet provided returns a boolean value. Given the initial state, we know that `lst` is a list with at least one item, `item` is the first item in `lst`, and `element` is an object that can be compared to the elements in `lst`, with the condition that `item` is not equal to `element`.

Output State: **The program returns False**
