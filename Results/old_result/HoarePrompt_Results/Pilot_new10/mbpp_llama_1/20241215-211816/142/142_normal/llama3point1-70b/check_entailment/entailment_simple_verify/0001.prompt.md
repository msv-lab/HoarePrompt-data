You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and element and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all((item == element for item in lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes in a list `lst` and an element, then uses the built-in `all` function in combination with a generator expression to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element.

Here's a breakdown of why this function works as expected:

1. The `all` function returns `True` if all elements of the iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true. If at least one element is false, it returns `False`.

2. The generator expression `(item == element for item in lst)` generates a sequence of boolean values, where each value is `True` if the corresponding item in the list is equal to the given element, and `False` otherwise.

3. By combining `all` with the generator expression, the function will return `True` only if all items in the list are equal to the given element, which perfectly meets the problem description.

To verify the correctness of this function, we can consider various test cases:

- An empty list: `func_1([], 5)` returns `True` because the `all` function returns `True` for an empty iterable. This aligns with the problem description since there are no items in the list that are not equal to the given element.

- A list with all items equal to the given element: `func_1([5, 5, 5], 5)` returns `True`, which is correct.

- A list with not all items equal to the given element: `func_1([5, 3, 5], 5)` returns `False`, which is also correct.

Since the function handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description, it is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and element is any type of object that can be compared with the items in lst.
def func_1(lst, element):
    return all(item == element for item in lst)
    #The program returns True if all items in lst are equal to element, False otherwise


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
