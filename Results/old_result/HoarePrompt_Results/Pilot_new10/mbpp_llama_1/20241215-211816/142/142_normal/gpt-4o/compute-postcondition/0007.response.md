According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst`. If the list has at least 3 items, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least two items, `item` is the second item in `lst`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 items and the `item` is the third item in the `lst`.
State: **`lst` is a list with at least three items, `item` is the third item in `lst`**
