To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the provided code.

The problem description asks for a function that checks whether all items in a given list are equal to a specified element. The function should return `True` if all items in the list are equal to the element and `False` otherwise.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes in a list `lst` and an element. It uses the built-in `all()` function in combination with a generator expression to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element.

Here is the breakdown of how the code works:

1. `item == element for item in lst`: This is a generator expression that iterates over each item in the list `lst` and checks if it is equal to the specified `element`.

2. `all(...)`: The `all()` function returns `True` if all elements in the given iterable (in this case, the generator expression) are true. If at least one element is false, it returns `False`.

Given this explanation, the provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. For every potential case, it checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element and returns `True` or `False` accordingly.

Example cases that demonstrate its correctness include:

- An empty list and any element: The function will return `True` because there are no items in the list that are not equal to the element (vacuously true).
- A list with all elements equal to the given element: The function will return `True`.
- A list where at least one element is not equal to the given element: The function will return `False`.

Given the above analysis, it's clear that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
