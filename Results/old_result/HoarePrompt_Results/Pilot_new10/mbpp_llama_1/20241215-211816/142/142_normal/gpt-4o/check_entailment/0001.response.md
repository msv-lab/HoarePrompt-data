Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct because it meets the requirements described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks whether all items in the input list are equal to the given element. It uses a simple and efficient approach by iterating through each item in the list and comparing it to the given element. If it finds any item that does not match the given element, it immediately returns `False`. If it iterates through the entire list without finding any mismatches, it returns `True`.

This program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

- An empty list: Although not explicitly tested, if an empty list were passed to the function, it would correctly return `True` for any element, because there are no items in the list that are not equal to the given element.
- A list with a single element: The function will correctly return `True` if the single element matches the given element and `False` otherwise.
- A list with multiple elements: As demonstrated by the provided unit tests, the function correctly returns `True` only when all elements in the list are equal to the given element and `False` otherwise.

The function's logic is straightforward and comprehensive, covering all possible scenarios without any apparent gaps or edge cases that it does not handle correctly. Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the analysis of the program's behavior, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
