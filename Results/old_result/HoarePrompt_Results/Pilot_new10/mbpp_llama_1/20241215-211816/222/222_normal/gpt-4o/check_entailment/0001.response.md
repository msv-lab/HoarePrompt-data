Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem statement asks to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the provided code removes all lowercase characters, not just substrings.

For example, if we have the string 'aBa', the code will return 'B', which is incorrect because it should remove the entire substring 'a' and return 'Ba'. However, in this specific implementation, the code is actually removing all lowercase characters, not just substrings. 

A correct implementation should iterate through the string, checking for substrings that are entirely in lowercase and removing them. However, the provided code does not do this.

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to modify the function to identify and remove sequences of lowercase characters, not just individual lowercase characters. 

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly: 
Let's consider the string 'AbcDEf'. The program will return 'ADE', which is incorrect because it should remove the entire substring 'bc' and return 'ADEF'.
