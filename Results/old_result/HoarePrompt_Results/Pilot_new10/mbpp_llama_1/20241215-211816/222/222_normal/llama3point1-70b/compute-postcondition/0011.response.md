To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's break down the information provided and analyze the loop's behavior.

The loop iterates over each character `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is an uppercase letter, it appends `char` to the `result` string. The output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times give us insight into how `result` is constructed based on the characters in `s`.

- After 1 iteration, `result` contains the first character of `s` if it is uppercase; otherwise, `result` remains an empty string.
- After 2 iterations, `result` contains the first character of `s` (if it is uppercase) plus the second character (if it is uppercase), or just the second character (if it is uppercase and the first is not), or remains the same as after the first iteration if the second character is not uppercase.
- After 3 iterations, `result` is the accumulation of all uppercase characters encountered so far in `s`.

Given this pattern, we can deduce that after all iterations of the loop have finished, `result` will contain all the uppercase characters from the original string `s`, in the order they appeared. If `s` contains no uppercase characters, `result` will remain an empty string.

Therefore, considering the loop's behavior and the provided output states, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is:

Output State: **`s` is the original string, `result` is a string containing all the uppercase characters from `s`, `char` is the last character in `s`.**
