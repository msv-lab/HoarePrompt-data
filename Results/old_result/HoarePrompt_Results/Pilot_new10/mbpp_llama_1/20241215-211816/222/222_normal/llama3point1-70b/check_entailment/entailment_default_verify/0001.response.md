The original assessment was "None", indicating that no initial assessment was made. However, based on the problem description and the provided code, we can evaluate the correctness of the program.

The problem description asks for a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that iterates over each character in the input string and appends it to the result if the character is uppercase. This effectively removes all lowercase characters from the string, not just lowercase substrings.

The output hints suggest that the function correctly handles empty strings and strings with only lowercase characters, returning an empty string in these cases. However, they also mention that the function may throw an error if the input is not a string, which is not explicitly handled by the code.

Considering the problem description, the code does not entirely meet the requirements. The code removes all lowercase characters, not just lowercase substrings. For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the function would return "HW", which is correct if the goal is to remove all lowercase characters. However, if the goal is to remove lowercase substrings (e.g., "ello" from "Hello"), the function does not achieve this.

Given this analysis, the original assessment of "None" is not accurate because it does not reflect the fact that the code does not fully meet the problem description's requirements.

Final: **False**
