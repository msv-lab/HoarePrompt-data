Correctness: **True**

The problem description states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, upon closer inspection, it seems that the function is actually designed to remove individual lowercase characters, not substrings. 

But, upon analyzing the given unit tests and the output hints, we can see that the function works as expected for every potential case mentioned in the problem description. The unit tests check for different cases where the input string contains a mix of uppercase and lowercase characters, and the function correctly returns a string containing only the uppercase characters.

The output hints also agree with the code, stating that the function returns a new string containing all the uppercase characters from the input string, in the order they appear. If the input string is empty or contains no uppercase characters, the function returns an empty string, which is consistent with the code.

Therefore, based on the provided unit tests and output hints, the code seems to be correct and handles all potential cases as expected. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string, checks if the character is uppercase using the `isupper` method, and joins the uppercase characters into a new string. This approach ensures that the function works correctly for every potential case mentioned in the problem description.
