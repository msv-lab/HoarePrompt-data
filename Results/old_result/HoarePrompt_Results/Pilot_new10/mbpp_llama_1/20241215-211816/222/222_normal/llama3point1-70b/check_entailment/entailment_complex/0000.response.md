Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it only removes lowercase characters from the string, not lowercase substrings. A substring is a sequence of characters within a string, and the program does not check for sequences of lowercase characters.

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program will return "HW", which is correct. However, if the input string is "HeLLOwOrld", the program will return "HW", which is also correct. But if the input string is "abcABC", the program will return "ABC", which is correct according to the function's behavior, but the problem description asks to remove lowercase "substrings", implying that it should return "ABC" which is what the function does, however the function will fail in a case like "aBcAbC" where "aBc" and "AbC" are substrings with both upper and lower case characters, it will return "BC" because it only checks for individual characters and not substrings.

A correct solution would involve checking for sequences of lowercase characters and removing them from the string. The provided program does not do this, it only checks for individual lowercase characters and removes them. 

A correct implementation would involve iterating over the string and building a new string that excludes any sequences of lowercase characters. Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    temp = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            temp += char
        else:
            if temp:
                temp = ''
            result += char
    return result
```
This implementation will correctly remove any sequences of lowercase characters from the input string.
