The given code defines a set `months_with_30_days` containing the months (4, 6, 9, 11) that have 30 days. The initial state specifies that `month` is an integer between 1 and 12 (inclusive), representing the months of the year.

Since the code only defines a set and does not directly modify the `month` variable, the state of `month` remains unchanged. The set `months_with_30_days` is now defined and can be used in subsequent code to check if a given month has 30 days.

Output State: **`month` is an integer such that 1 <= `month` <= 12, `months_with_30_days` is a set containing {4, 6, 9, 11}**
