Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description asks to write a function that checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function `func_1` does exactly this by checking if the input `month` is one of the months with 30 days in the standard Gregorian calendar, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

The function uses a list `thirty_days_months` to store the month numbers with 30 days and then checks if the input `month` is in this list using the `in` operator. If the `month` is in the list, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month has 30 days. Otherwise, it returns `False`.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, as specified in the problem description, where the input `month` is an integer between 1 and 12. For example, if the input is 4 (April), 6 (June), 9 (September), or 11 (November), the function returns `True`, and for all other month numbers, it returns `False`.

The annotations provided in the code also confirm that the function behaves as expected, and the overall description of the function's behavior matches the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct, and the correctness is **True**.
