Correctness: **False**.

The code does not validate if the input `month` is an integer within the range of 1 to 12. For example, if the input is a non-integer (like a float or a string), or if the input is an integer outside the range of 1 to 12 (like 0, 13, or -1), the function will not behave as expected.

In the given code, if the input `month` is not within the range of 1 to 12 or if it's not an integer, it will not raise any errors, but it will simply return `False` for months outside the set `{4, 6, 9, 11}`, which does not align with the problem description.

For instance, if the input `month` is 13, the function will return `False` without indicating that the input is invalid. Similarly, if the input `month` is a string like "hello", the function will raise an error when attempting to check membership in the set, but it won't provide any meaningful information about the input being invalid.

To fix this issue, the function should include input validation to ensure that the `month` is an integer within the range of 1 to 12. 

For example, a more robust version of the function could be:
```python
def func_1(month: int) -> bool:
    if not isinstance(month, int) or not 1 <= month <= 12:
        raise ValueError("Invalid month. Month must be an integer between 1 and 12.")
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
```
