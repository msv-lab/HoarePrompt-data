You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
Program:
```
assert func_1(6) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(12) == False

def func_1(month: int) -> bool:
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct as it correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. The function `func_1` takes a month number as input and checks if it exists in the set `months_with_30_days`, which contains the numbers of months that have 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11). 

This solution assumes that the input will always be a valid month number between 1 and 12, as specified in the problem description. If the input can potentially be outside this range, additional error checking would be needed.

However, based on the problem description and the provided unit tests, the program works as expected. The function correctly returns `True` for months with 30 days and `False` for months with a different number of days. 

It correctly handles all 12 months of the year:
- Months with 31 days (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) return `False` as expected.
- Months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11) return `True` as expected.
- February (2), which has 28 or 29 days depending on the year, returns `False` as expected. 

Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided unit tests, the program is correct and should return the expected results for all valid inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(6) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(12) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
    #The program returns True if the month is one of the months with 30 days (4, 6, 9, 11), otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `month` and returns `True` if the month is April, June, September, or November, and `False` otherwise, without explicitly validating if the month is within the range of 1 to 12 or if it's an integer.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
