Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately checks whether a given month number contains 30 days or not. According to the problem description, months are given as numbers from 1 to 12. The function `func_1` takes a month number as input and checks if it belongs to the list of months that have 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11).

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function correctly identifies the months with 30 days: April, June, September, and November.
2. It uses a list `thirty_days_months` to store the month numbers of these months.
3. The function returns `True` if the input month is in this list, indicating that the month has 30 days.
4. It returns `False` otherwise, indicating that the month does not have 30 days.

This implementation covers all possible cases, as it checks every input month number against the list of months with 30 days. The program does not have any potential errors or edge cases that would cause it to deviate from the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and always meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
