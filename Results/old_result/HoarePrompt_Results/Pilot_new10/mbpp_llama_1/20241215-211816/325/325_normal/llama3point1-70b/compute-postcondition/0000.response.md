The code defines a list `thirty_days_months` containing the months with 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). This list does not depend on the value of the `month` variable. 

The variable `month` remains unchanged as it is not modified by the code. 

Output State: **`month` is an integer such that 1 <= `month` <= 12, `thirty_days_months` is a list [4, 6, 9, 11]**
