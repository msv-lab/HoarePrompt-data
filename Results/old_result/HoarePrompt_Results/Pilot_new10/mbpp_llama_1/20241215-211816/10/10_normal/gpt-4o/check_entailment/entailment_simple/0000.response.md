To determine the correctness of the given program, let's analyze it based on the problem description, which is to find the volume of a triangular prism.

The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is given by:
\[ \text{Volume} = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length} \]
where the base area of a triangle is calculated as:
\[ \text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} \]
Thus, substituting the base area formula into the volume formula gives:
\[ \text{Volume} = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height}\right) \times \text{Length} \]
\[ \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{Base} \times \text{Height} \times \text{Length} \]

Let's examine the provided Python function `func_1(base, height, length)`:
```python
def func_1(base, height, length):
    base_area = 0.5 * base * height
    volume = base_area * length
    return volume
```
Here, the function first calculates the `base_area` using the formula for the area of a triangle (`0.5 * base * height`), and then calculates the `volume` by multiplying the `base_area` by the `length`. This directly implements the formula for the volume of a triangular prism.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the function against expected outcomes for specific inputs, which is crucial for verifying the correctness of the function. However, to confirm that the function always does what the problem description says, we must consider all potential cases, not just those covered by the unit tests.

Given that the function correctly implements the mathematical formula for the volume of a triangular prism and uses the correct arithmetic operations for the given inputs (positive numbers for base, height, and length), it should work correctly for all positive inputs.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism for any given positive base, height, and length.

Correctness: **True**
