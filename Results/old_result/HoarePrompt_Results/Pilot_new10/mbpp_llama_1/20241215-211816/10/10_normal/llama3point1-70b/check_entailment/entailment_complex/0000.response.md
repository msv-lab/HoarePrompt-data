Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the volume of a triangular prism according to the formula provided in the problem description. The volume of a triangular prism is indeed the product of the area of the triangular base and the length of the prism, and the area of the base is calculated as (base length * height) / 2. 

The function `func_1(b, h, l)` takes three parameters: `b` (the base length), `h` (the height of the triangular base), and `l` (the length of the prism), and returns their product divided by 2, which corresponds to the volume of a triangular prism if `b`, `h`, and `l` represent non-negative base length, height, and length respectively.

Although the program does not validate the non-negativity of the inputs, the problem description does not explicitly require input validation. It only states that `b`, `h`, and `l` are non-negative numbers, which implies that the user or the caller of the function is responsible for ensuring that the inputs are valid. 

Therefore, assuming that the inputs are valid (i.e., `b`, `h`, and `l` are non-negative numbers), the program correctly calculates the volume of the triangular prism according to the formula provided in the problem description.
