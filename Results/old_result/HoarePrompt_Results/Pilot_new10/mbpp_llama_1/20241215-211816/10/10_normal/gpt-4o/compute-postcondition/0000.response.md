The code calculates the area of a triangle using the formula 0.5 * base * height and assigns it to the variable `base_area`. The values of `base`, `height`, and `length` are positive numbers. The calculation of `base_area` does not affect the values of `base`, `height`, and `length`. 

Output State: **`base` is a positive number, `height` is a positive number, `length` is a positive number, `base_area` is 0.5 * `base` * `height`**
