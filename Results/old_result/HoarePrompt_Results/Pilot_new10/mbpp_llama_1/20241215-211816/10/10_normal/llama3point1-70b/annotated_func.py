#State of the program right berfore the function call: b, h, and l are non-negative numbers where b is the base length of the triangular prism, h is the height of the triangular base, and l is the length of the prism.
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
    #The program returns the volume of the triangular prism, which is the product of the area of the triangular base and the length of the prism, where the area of the base is calculated as (base length * height) / 2 and base length, height, and length are non-negative numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters b, h, and l, and returns their product divided by 2, which corresponds to the volume of a triangular prism if b, h, and l represent non-negative base length, height, and length respectively; however, it does not validate the non-negativity of the inputs and will return a value for any real numbers b, h, and l, including negative numbers and zero.
