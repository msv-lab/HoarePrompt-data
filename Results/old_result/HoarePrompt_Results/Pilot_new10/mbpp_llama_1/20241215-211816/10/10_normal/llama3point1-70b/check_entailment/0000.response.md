Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume of a triangular prism is `(base area) * height`, where the base area is `(base * height) / 2` for a triangle. In this case, the function multiplies the base `b`, the height of the triangle `h`, and the length `l` of the prism, and divides by 2 to calculate the volume of the triangular prism. 

This function appears to be correct for all potential cases. The formula used in the function accurately represents the volume of a triangular prism, and it handles all possible inputs correctly, assuming that the inputs are non-negative numbers. 

For example, if you call `func_1(5, 6, 7)`, it will return the correct volume of a triangular prism with a base of 5 units, a triangle height of 6 units, and a length of 7 units. 

There are no apparent edge cases that the function does not handle correctly. It will work correctly for triangular prisms with any non-negative base, triangle height, and length.
