Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` calculates the volume of a triangular prism correctly. The volume of a triangular prism can be calculated by multiplying the area of the base (which is a triangle) by the length of the prism. The area of a triangle is calculated as half the product of the base and height of the triangle. 

In the given function, `base_area` is calculated as `0.5 * base * height`, which is the correct formula for the area of a triangle, and then `volume` is calculated as `base_area * length`, which is the correct formula for the volume of a triangular prism.

The provided unit tests also confirm the correctness of the function. For example, `func_1(10, 8, 6)` returns `240`, which is the correct volume of a triangular prism with a base of length `10`, a height of `8`, and a length of `6`, since the area of the base is `0.5 * 10 * 8 = 40` and the volume is `40 * 6 = 240`.

I was unable to find any potential case where the function does not work as expected, and the provided unit tests all pass, so I conclude that the function is correct.
