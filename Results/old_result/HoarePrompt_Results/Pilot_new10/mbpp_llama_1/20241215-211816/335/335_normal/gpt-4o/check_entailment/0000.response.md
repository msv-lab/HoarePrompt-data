Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` appears to be correct based on the problem description. It finds the first occurrence of the substring within the main string and returns a tuple containing the substring, its start position, and end position. If the substring is not found, it returns `None`.

The function uses the `find` method of the string class to get the start position of the substring. If `find` returns `-1`, it means the substring is not found, so the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it calculates the end position by adding the length of the substring to the start position.

All the provided unit tests seem to work correctly with this function. It correctly identifies the start and end positions of the substrings in the main string and returns `None` when the substring is not found.

The function handles the edge cases well, such as when the substring is at the beginning or end of the main string, and when the substring is not found. It does not have any apparent issues with handling different types of input, such as empty strings or substrings.

Overall, the function seems to meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and no potential cases could be found where it does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the function is **True**.
