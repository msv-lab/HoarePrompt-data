The original assessment is `None`, indicating that no initial evaluation of the program's correctness was provided.

Based on the problem description, the code, and the output hints, I can evaluate the correctness of the program. The problem description asks for a function to find the occurrence and position of substrings within a string, returning `None` if there is no match.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two strings as input: `main_string` and `sub_string`. It uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of `sub_string` in `main_string`. If `sub_string` is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the function returns `None`. Otherwise, it calculates the end position of the substring and returns a tuple containing the substring, its start position, and its end position.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning `None` if the substring is not found and a tuple with the substring and its positions if it is found.

After analyzing the code and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
