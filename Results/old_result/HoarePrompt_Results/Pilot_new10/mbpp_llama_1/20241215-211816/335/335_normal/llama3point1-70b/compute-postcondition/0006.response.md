The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `string` and `substring`, both of which are strings. After executing the function body, 
Case 1: the function returns `None`.
Case 2: the function returns the `substring` found in the `string`, along with the starting index of this `substring` and the index of the last character of the `substring`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two string parameters, `string` and `substring`, and return either `None` or the `substring` along with its start and end indices in the `string`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two string parameters, returns `None` or the substring along with its start and end indices in the string.**
