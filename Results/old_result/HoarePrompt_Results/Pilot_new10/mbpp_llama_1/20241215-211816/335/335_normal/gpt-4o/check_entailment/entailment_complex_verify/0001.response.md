Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the original assessment of "None" implies that there was no initial assessment made, which does not directly indicate whether the program is correct or incorrect. The annotated version provides insight into what the program does and how it operates at different stages.

The program is designed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a main string. It uses the `find` method of the string class in Python, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring if found, and -1 otherwise. The program correctly handles the case when the substring is not found, returning `None` as specified in the problem description.

When the substring is found, the program calculates its ending position by adding the length of the substring to the starting position. This calculation is correct and aligns with how string indices work in Python, where the end index of a slice is exclusive.

The annotated code provides a step-by-step breakdown of the program's state and logic, reinforcing the understanding that the program operates as intended according to the problem description. It finds the substring, determines its start and end positions, and returns these values, or it returns `None` if the substring is not found.

Therefore, based on the information provided and the correctness of the program's logic as described in the annotations, I assess the program's correctness as follows:

Final: **True**
