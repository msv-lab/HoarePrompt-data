Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code is designed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a main string. It uses the find() method, which returns the index of the first occurrence of the substring. If the substring is not found, it returns -1, and the function returns None. 

The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `main_string` and `sub_string`. It first finds the starting position of `sub_string` in `main_string` using the `find()` method. If `sub_string` is not found, it returns None. Otherwise, it calculates the ending position by adding the length of `sub_string` to the starting position.

The code handles all potential cases correctly:

1. It returns None if the substring is not found.
2. It returns the correct starting and ending positions of the substring if it is found.

The provided assertions also validate the correctness of the function for different cases, including finding a substring at different positions and returning None when the substring is not found.

Therefore, based on the problem description, output hints, and provided assertions, the code appears to work correctly in every potential case.
