The original assessment was None, indicating that no initial assessment of the program's correctness was provided. 

Upon reviewing the problem description and the provided code, we can see that the function `func_1` is designed to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. The function correctly uses the `find` method to get the starting position of the substring, and it returns `None` if the substring is not found.

The annotated version of the code further confirms that the function behaves as intended. It correctly calculates the ending position of the substring by adding the length of the substring to the starting position.

Based on the provided information, the function appears to be correct. It handles the cases where the substring is found and where it is not found, and it returns the expected results.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the function. The tests cover different scenarios, including finding a substring at the beginning of the string, finding a substring in the middle of the string, and not finding a substring.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations, I conclude that the original assessment should be updated to indicate that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
