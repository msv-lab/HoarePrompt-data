Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a `string` and a `substring` as input. It uses the `find` method to locate the first occurrence of the `substring` within the `string`. If the `substring` is not found, `find` returns -1, and the function returns `None`.

If the `substring` is found, the function calculates the end position of the match by adding the length of the `substring` to the start position. It then returns a tuple containing the matched `substring`, its start position, and its end position.

The program handles the case where the `substring` is not found in the `string` by returning `None`. It also correctly calculates the start and end positions of the match.

The program works as expected for all potential cases, including:

- When the `substring` is found at the beginning of the `string`.
- When the `substring` is found in the middle of the `string`.
- When the `substring` is found at the end of the `string`.
- When the `substring` is not found in the `string`.
- When the `string` or `substring` is empty.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
