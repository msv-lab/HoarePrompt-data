The original assessment of "None" implies a lack of information or no initial judgment about the program's correctness. This assessment seems to be a placeholder or an acknowledgement that no evaluation has been made yet.

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string and a substring as input and returns a tuple containing the substring, its starting index, and the index of its last character if the substring is found in the string. If the substring is not found, the function returns `None`.

The output hints align with the provided code, explaining its functionality and potential edge cases such as handling empty strings and assuming inputs are strings without performing validation.

Given the problem description, the code, and the output hints, the program seems to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem: finding the occurrence and position of a substring within a string and returning `None` if there is no match.

However, considering the problem statement asks to find "the occurrence and position of the substrings" (plural), the code provided seems to find only the first occurrence of a single substring. If the intention was to find all occurrences, the program would be incomplete as it only returns the first match.

Since the output hints indicate the function's behavior aligns with finding a single substring's occurrence and the program does indeed return `None` if there's no match, the only discrepancy is potentially in the interpretation of "the substrings" as requiring a function that finds multiple occurrences.

Given the strict interpretation of the problem as described and considering standard practices in programming problems, the issue with the program seems to be its failure to address all possible occurrences as implied by the plural "substrings," but this might be a misunderstanding based on the singular nature of the function's parameters and return values.

Therefore, based on the provided code, output hints, and the assumption that the problem description implies finding at least one occurrence of a substring (given the singular nature of the parameters and return values), the final assessment is that the original code provides the functionality for finding a single substring's occurrence as described, albeit with potential ambiguity in the problem statement.

Final: **False**
