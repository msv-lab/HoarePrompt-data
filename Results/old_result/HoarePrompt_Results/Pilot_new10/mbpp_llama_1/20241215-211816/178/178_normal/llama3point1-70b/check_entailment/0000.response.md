Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers as input, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and then returns the product of this sum and the length of the input list. 

Here's why the code is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a list of numbers as input, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **Rounding Numbers**: The list comprehension `[round(num) for num in numbers]` correctly rounds each number in the input list to the nearest integer.

3. **Sum Calculation**: The `sum(rounded_numbers)` line correctly calculates the sum of the rounded numbers.

4. **Multiplication by List Length**: The product of the sum of rounded numbers and the length of the input list is calculated and returned.

Given these steps, the function performs exactly as the problem description requires. It rounds every number in the given list, calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list, returning the result.

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to not work as described, assuming the input is a list of numbers. The function does not handle non-numeric inputs explicitly, but it will raise a TypeError if the list contains non-numeric values, which is a reasonable behavior for a function with a specific numeric input requirement. However, the problem description does not specify the behavior for non-numeric inputs, so in the context of the task (focusing strictly on lists of numbers), the function behaves correctly.
