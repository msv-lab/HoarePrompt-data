Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the list contains non-numeric values. The function assumes that all elements in the list are numeric, but if a non-numeric value is present, the `round()` function will throw a `TypeError`. Additionally, the code does not handle potential overflow errors. 

For example, if the list is `[1e308, 1e308]`, the `sum()` function will return `inf`, and the `total_sum * len(numbers)` operation will throw an `OverflowError`.

However, another potential issue can be when the input list is empty. Although the output hints say the function returns 0 in such a case, the actual code will throw a `ZeroDivisionError` or return `nan` (Not a Number) because the `sum()` of an empty list is 0 and 0 multiplied by 0 is 0 but the code can be improved for clarity by adding an explicit condition to check for this case. 

To fix these issues, the code should include error checking to handle non-numeric values and potential overflow errors, and explicitly handle the case of an empty list. 

A correct version of the function might include these checks, for example:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    if not all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in numbers):
        raise ValueError("The list must only contain numeric values")
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
```
