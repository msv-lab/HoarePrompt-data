Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle cases where the input list contains non-numeric values, which could result in a TypeError. According to the problem description, the function should work for a "given list of numbers", but it does not specify what should happen if the list contains non-numeric values. The output hints also mention this potential issue, stating that the function "does not handle lists with non-numeric values, potentially resulting in a TypeError". 

For example, if the input list is `[1, 2, '3', 4, 5]`, the function will throw a TypeError when trying to round the string '3' because the round() function in Python can only be applied to numeric types. 

To fix this issue, the function could be modified to check if all elements in the list are numbers before attempting to round them. If the list contains non-numeric values, the function could either raise a custom error, ignore the non-numeric values, or handle them in some other way that makes sense for the specific use case. 

Here is an example of how the function could be modified to handle this case:
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    if not all(isinstance(num, (int, float)) for num in numbers):
        raise ValueError("All elements in the list must be numbers")
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
```
