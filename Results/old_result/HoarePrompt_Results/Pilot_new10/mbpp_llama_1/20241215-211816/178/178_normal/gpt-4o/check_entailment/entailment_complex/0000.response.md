Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets all the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's a step-by-step analysis:

1. **Rounded numbers**: The program uses a list comprehension to round each number in the input list to the nearest integer, which is done by the `round(num)` function.

2. **Sum of rounded numbers**: The program calculates the sum of these rounded numbers using the built-in `sum()` function.

3. **Product of sum and length**: The program then multiplies this sum by the total count of numbers in the list, which is obtained using the `len()` function.

4. **Return result**: Finally, the program returns this product.

The program also handles the edge case where the input list is empty, returning `0` in this case (because the sum of an empty list is `0`, and the length of an empty list is also `0`, so the product is `0 * 0 = 0`).

However, it's worth noting that the program does not handle the case where the input list contains non-numeric values. In such a case, the program would raise a `TypeError` when trying to round a non-numeric value. But this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description as a requirement, so based on the provided description, the program can be considered correct. 

One potential issue is that the problem description asks to "print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list", but the program returns this value instead of printing it. However, the unit tests provided suggest that returning the value is the expected behavior, so this can be considered a minor discrepancy between the problem description and the unit tests. 

Overall, based on the provided problem description and unit tests, the program can be considered correct.
