#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns the product of the sum of the rounded numbers and the total count of numbers in the list, where each rounded number is the rounded version of each number in the `numbers` list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and returns the product of this sum and the total count of numbers. It returns 0 for an empty list but does not handle lists with non-numeric values, potentially resulting in a TypeError.
