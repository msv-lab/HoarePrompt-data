Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately filters the dictionary to only include entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. The dictionary comprehension `{k: v for (k, v) in d.items() if v >= n}` iterates over each key-value pair in the dictionary `d` and only includes the pair in the new dictionary if the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`.

This program handles all potential cases, including:

* Empty dictionaries: The function will return an empty dictionary, which is the expected result.
* Dictionaries with no values greater than or equal to `n`: The function will return an empty dictionary, which is the expected result.
* Dictionaries with all values greater than or equal to `n`: The function will return a copy of the original dictionary, which is the expected result.
* Dictionaries with a mix of values greater than or equal to `n` and values less than `n`: The function will return a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs where the value is greater than or equal to `n`, which is the expected result.

The function also correctly handles non-integer values and non-numeric values in the dictionary, although the problem description does not specify how these cases should be handled. In Python, attempting to compare a non-numeric value to an integer using `>=` will raise a TypeError. If the problem description intended to specify that the dictionary should only contain numeric values, the function may need to be modified to handle or raise an error for non-numeric values. However, based on the provided problem description, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.
