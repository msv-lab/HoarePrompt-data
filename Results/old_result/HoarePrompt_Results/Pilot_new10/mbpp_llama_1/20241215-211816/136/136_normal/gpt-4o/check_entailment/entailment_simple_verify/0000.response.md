The original assessment seems to be accurate based on the problem description and the provided code. The function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to include only entries with values greater than or equal to the given integer `n`. 

The annotated version of the code confirms this, as it describes the state of the program before and after the function call, and the return statement correctly implements the desired functionality.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the function, as they cover different scenarios and the function returns the expected results.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program correctly implements the desired functionality.

Final: **True**
