To determine the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's analyze the annotated code and the return postconditions step by step:

1. **Parameters and Return Type**: The function accepts two parameters: a dictionary `d` with integer values and an integer `n`. It returns a dictionary.

2. **Functionality Description**: The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary. This dictionary includes only the key-value pairs from the original dictionary `d` where the value `v` is greater than or equal to the integer `n`.

3. **Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - **Empty Dictionary**: If `d` is an empty dictionary, the function will return an empty dictionary, as there are no key-value pairs to filter.
   - **Non-Integer Values in Dictionary**: The annotations and the code suggest that the dictionary `d` contains only integer values. However, if `d` contains non-integer values, the comparison `v >= n` will still work for types that can be compared to integers (like floats), but it may raise a TypeError for other types (like strings, lists, etc.). The functionality should note that the code assumes integer values but might behave unexpectedly or throw errors for non-integer, non-comparable values.
   - **Negative or Zero `n`**: The function does not have any specific handling for negative or zero values of `n`. It will simply filter the dictionary based on the given `n`, including the case where `n` is 0 or negative.
   - **None or Missing Inputs**: The code does not handle cases where `d` or `n` might be `None` or missing. If `d` is `None`, attempting to access `d.items()` will result in an AttributeError. If `n` is `None`, the comparison `v >= n` will throw a TypeError.

4. **Actual Code Behavior**: The code does exactly what the annotations describe for the cases where `d` is a dictionary with integer values and `n` is an integer. However, the code does not explicitly handle or mention edge cases like empty dictionaries, non-integer values in the dictionary, negative or zero `n`, or `None` inputs.

Given this analysis, the functionality of `func_1` can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a dictionary `d` and an integer `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. It assumes `d` contains only integer values and does not explicitly handle edge cases such as empty dictionaries, non-integer values, negative or zero `n`, or `None` inputs, which may result in unexpected behavior or errors. **
