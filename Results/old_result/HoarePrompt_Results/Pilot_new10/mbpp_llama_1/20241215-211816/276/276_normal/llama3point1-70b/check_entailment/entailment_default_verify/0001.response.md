The original assessment is "None," indicating no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. 

The problem description requires finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that merges two lists, sorts the merged list, and calculates the median based on whether the total length is even or odd.

The output hints suggest that the function works as intended, merging the lists, sorting them, and returning the median. However, they also imply assumptions about the input (sorted lists, non-empty, and the length parameter matching the list lengths), which are crucial for the function's correctness.

Upon examining the code, it appears to correctly implement the described functionality under the given assumptions. The key steps are:
1. Merging the two input lists.
2. Sorting the merged list.
3. Identifying the middle index (or indices for even lengths).
4. Calculating the median as either the middle element (for odd lengths) or the average of the two middle elements (for even lengths).

However, the calculation of the `middle_index` is done as `size - 1`, which seems incorrect because if the total size of the merged list is `2*size` (since the two lists are of the same size), the middle indices for even lengths would be `size - 1` and `size`, considering 0-based indexing. The function seems to correctly handle the calculation of the median for both even and odd total lengths, but the indexing calculation should ensure it points to the correct "middle" elements.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the original assessment's lack of evaluation does not directly impact the correctness evaluation. However, the code provided does seem to attempt to solve the problem correctly, with the potential exception of how the middle index is calculated, which could lead to incorrect median calculations for certain input sizes.

Final: **False**
