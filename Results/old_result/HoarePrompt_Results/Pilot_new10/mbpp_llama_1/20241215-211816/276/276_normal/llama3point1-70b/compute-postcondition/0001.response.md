The code assigns the value `size - 1` to the variable `middle_index`. The previous values of the variables `list1`, `list2`, `size`, and `merged_list` are not affected by this line of code. 

The value of `size` is a positive integer, and `middle_index` becomes `size - 1`, which will be the index of the last element in `list1` and `list2` since Python uses zero-based indexing and both lists have a length of `size`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, each with a length of `size`; `size` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2 * size`; `middle_index` is `size - 1`.
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, each with a length of `size`; `size` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2 * size`; `middle_index` is `size - 1`**
