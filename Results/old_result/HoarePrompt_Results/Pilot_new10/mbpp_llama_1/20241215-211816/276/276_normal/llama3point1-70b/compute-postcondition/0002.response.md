Postcondition: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, each with a length of `size`; `size` is a positive integer and the current value of `size` is even, since `size` modulo 2 equals 0; `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2 * size`; `middle_index` is `size - 1`**
