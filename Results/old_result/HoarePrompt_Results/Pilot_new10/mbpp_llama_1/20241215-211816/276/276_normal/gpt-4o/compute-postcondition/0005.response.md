To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. 

The initial state provides the following information:
- `list1` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`.
- `list2` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`.
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order with length `2n`.
- `mid` equals `n`.
- The length of `merged_list` is odd.

Given that the length of `merged_list` is odd and equals `2n`, and knowing that `n` is a positive integer, it seems there might be a contradiction because `2n` would typically result in an even number. However, since the problem states the length of `merged_list` is odd, and it's also stated that `mid` equals `n`, we will proceed under the assumption that there's a misunderstanding in the problem statement regarding the length of `merged_list` being odd when `2n` is inherently even. For the sake of solving this, let's correct the understanding: if `merged_list` has a length of `2n` and `n` is a positive integer, then `merged_list` indeed has an even length, not an odd one.

The code `median = merged_list[mid]` assigns the value of the element at index `mid` in `merged_list` to the variable `median`. Given that `mid` equals `n`, this means we're looking at the `n`-th index (0-based indexing), which would be the middle element if the list had an odd length. However, since `merged_list` has an even length (`2n`), the middle would typically be between the `n-1` and `n` indices.

To correct and clarify based on standard indexing practices and the information given:
- If we were to find the median of an even-length sorted list, we would typically average the two middle numbers. However, the code provided does not do this; it simply assigns the value at the `mid` index (which is `n`) to `median`.

Given this analysis and sticking strictly to what the code does:
- The variable `median` is assigned the value of `merged_list[n]`.
- The other variables (`list1`, `list2`, `n`, `merged_list`, and `mid`) do not change.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`list1` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`, `list2` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order with length `2n`, `mid` equals `n`, and `median` equals `merged_list[n]`.**
