The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, both sorted in ascending order, and `size` is a positive integer where `size` equals the length of both `list1` and `list2`. After executing the function body, it returns the median of the merged and sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`. This median is calculated as the average of the two middle elements if the total length of the merged list is even, or as the middle element if the total length of the merged list is odd. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists of integers and their common length, and returns the median of the merged list.**
