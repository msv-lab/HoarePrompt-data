Postcondition: ***`list1` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`, `list2` is a sorted list of numbers with length `n`, `n` is a positive integer, `merged_list` is a sorted list of numbers containing all elements from `list1` and `list2` in ascending order with length `2n`, `mid` equals `n`. If the length of `merged_list` is even, `median` equals `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`. Otherwise, given the corrected understanding that `merged_list` should have an even length based on `2n`, but proceeding with the provided condition for analysis, `median` would equal `merged_list[n]`. However, based on the standard interpretation of the problem's initial conditions implying an even-length `merged_list`, the condition for an odd length is not applicable, leading to the simplification: `median` equals `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`.***
