Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly calculates the median of the combined and sorted list of two input lists. The function merges the two sorted lists into one, sorts the merged list, and then calculates the median. If the length of the merged list is even, the median is the average of the two middle numbers. If the length of the merged list is odd, the median is the middle number itself.

In the provided code, the calculation of the median is done by checking if the length of the merged list is even or odd. The line `if len(merged_list) % 2 == 0:` checks if the length of the list is even, and if so, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers. The line `median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2` ensures that the average of the two middle numbers is calculated correctly.

The provided unit tests also confirm that the code is working correctly. For example, the test `assert func_1([1, 12, 15, 26, 38], [2, 13, 17, 30, 45], 5) == 16.0` passes because the merged list is `[1, 2, 12, 13, 15, 17, 26, 30, 38, 45]`, and the median is the average of the two middle numbers, which is `(15 + 17) / 2 = 16.0`.

The output hints also agree with the code, stating that the function returns the median of the sorted merged list, calculated as the average of the two middle numbers.

Therefore, based on the code, output hints, and unit tests, it appears that the code correctly calculates the median of the combined and sorted list of two input lists, and it should work correctly for every potential case.
