Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the median of two sorted lists of the same size. Here's why:

1. It merges the two sorted lists into one list `merged_list` and sorts it.
2. It then finds the middle index `mid` of the `merged_list`.
3. If the length of `merged_list` is even, it calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers.
4. If the length of `merged_list` is odd, it calculates the median as the middle number.

The function handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Lists of different sizes are not handled by the function, but this is explicitly stated in the problem description that the lists are of the same size.
* Edge cases, such as empty lists or lists with duplicate elements, are not mentioned in the problem description, but the function would still work correctly for these cases.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the function's correctness for different input scenarios.

In conclusion, since the function correctly implements the logic to calculate the median of two sorted lists of the same size and handles all potential cases, the Correctness is **True**.
