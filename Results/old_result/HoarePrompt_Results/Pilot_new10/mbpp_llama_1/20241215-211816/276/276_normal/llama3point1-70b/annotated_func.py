#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, size is a positive integer such that size == len(list1) and size == len(list2), and both list1 and list2 are sorted in ascending order.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, sorted in ascending order, each with a length of `size`; `size` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers, containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`, with a length of `2 * size`; `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, the `median` is the average of the two middle elements `(merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2`. If `size` is odd, the `median` is the middle element `merged_list[size]` however since `middle_index` is `size - 1`, it can be written as `merged_list[size - 1]`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median of the merged list, which is either the average of the two middle elements if `size` is even, or the middle element if `size` is odd, from a sorted list containing all elements from `list1` and `list2`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers and their common length, merges and sorts the lists, and returns the median of the merged list, either as the average of the two middle elements if the length is even or the middle element if the length is odd, assuming the input lists are sorted and non-empty and the length parameter matches the list lengths.
