The original assessment is None, which means there is no previous verdict on the correctness of the program.

The problem description requires a function to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that merges two sorted lists, sorts the merged list, and calculates the median.

The output hints indicate that the function accepts two sorted lists and a positive integer (the length of both lists) and returns the median of the sorted merged list.

Upon examining the code, it appears to correctly implement the required functionality. The code merges the two input lists, sorts the merged list, and calculates the median as the average of the two middle numbers when the length of the merged list is even.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
