To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop statement and the current program state.

The `while` loop statement is `while True:`, which means the loop will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a `break` statement. Since there's no conditional statement that could potentially stop the loop, we don't need to adjust any states based on the loop condition itself.

Given the current program state:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `k` is 2.
- `triangular_number` is 1.
- The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.

Since the loop is a `while True` loop, it will execute again regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states of `n`, `k`, or `triangular_number` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`**
