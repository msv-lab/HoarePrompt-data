Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, it appears that the original assessment was "None", implying that there was no initial assessment made.

The problem description requires a function to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that iteratively calculates triangular numbers and checks their length until it finds one with at least n digits.

The output hints suggest that the function should accept a positive integer `n` and return the smallest index `idx` such that the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number has a length of at least `n`. This description aligns with the code's behavior, as it dynamically calculates the index without any predefined upper limit.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears to be correct. It initializes an index `idx` to 1 and enters a loop where it calculates the `idx`-th triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. It then checks if the length of the string representation of this number is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the function returns the current value of `idx`. If not, it increments `idx` and repeats the process.

This logic is sound, and the code should produce the correct result for any valid input `n`. Therefore, based on the problem description and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment (or lack thereof) was not accurate because it did not provide an evaluation of the code's correctness.

The reason I think the original assessment is not accurate is that it did not evaluate the code at all, whereas the code appears to be a correct implementation of the problem description.

Final: **True**
