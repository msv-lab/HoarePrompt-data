To determine the output state, we analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: 
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `idx` is 2.
- `triangular_num` is 1.
- The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.

Given Code:
```python
triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
```

The code updates the value of `triangular_num` based on the formula for the `idx`-th triangular number, which is `idx * (idx + 1) / 2`. Given that `idx` is 2, we calculate `triangular_num` as follows:
- `triangular_num = 2 * (2 + 1) // 2 = 2 * 3 // 2 = 6 // 2 = 3`.

Thus, `triangular_num` becomes 3.

The states of `n` and `idx` are not changed by the code. The condition regarding the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` being less than `n` needs to be reevaluated with the new value of `triangular_num`.

Since `triangular_num` is now 3, its string representation is '3', which has a length of 1. The length of '3' (1) is less than any positive integer `n` greater than or equal to 1.

Therefore, the output state after executing the given code is:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `idx` is 2.
- `triangular_num` is 3.
- The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` (which is '3') is less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 3, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`.**
