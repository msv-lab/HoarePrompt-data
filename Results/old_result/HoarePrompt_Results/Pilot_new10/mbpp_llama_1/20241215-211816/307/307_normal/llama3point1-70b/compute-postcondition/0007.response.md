According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until it is manually terminated. Since there is no condition that needs to be met for the loop to execute again, none of the states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 2, `triangular_num` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is less than `n`**
