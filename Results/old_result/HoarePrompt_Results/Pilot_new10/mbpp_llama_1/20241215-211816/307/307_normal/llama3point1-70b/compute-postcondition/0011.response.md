The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` is 2, so the new value of `idx` is 3. The values of `n` and `triangular_num` are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 3, and `triangular_num` is 3. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program returns 2. Otherwise, no changes are made.**
