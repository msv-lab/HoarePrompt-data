The original assessment is "None", which means there is no prior evaluation of the program's correctness. 

Upon reviewing the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1(n)` is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The code uses a while loop to generate triangular numbers and checks the length of the string representation of each number. When it finds a triangular number with a string length greater than or equal to `n`, it returns the index of that triangular number.

The annotated code provides additional information about the state of the program at different points. Before the function call, `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, which is a valid input for the problem. After the loop, the function returns the smallest `idx` such that the length of the string representation of the `idx`-th triangular number is greater than or equal to the original value of `n`. This aligns with the problem description.

Based on the annotated version, the program appears to be correct. It correctly generates triangular numbers, checks their string lengths, and returns the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits.

Final: **True**
