The original assessment is None, which means there is no initial assessment to verify. 

The problem description is asking to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits. The provided code defines a function `func_1(n)` that iteratively calculates triangular numbers and checks if their string representation has a length of `n`. 

The output hints indicate that the function returns the smallest integer `k` for which the string representation of the `k`-th triangular number has a length of `n`. However, it also warns that the function may not handle non-positive integers or non-integers correctly.

Based on the problem description and the code, the function seems to be implemented correctly for the case when the input is a positive integer. It correctly finds the smallest `k` such that the `k`-th triangular number has `n` digits. However, as mentioned in the output hints, it does not handle non-positive integers or non-integers explicitly.

Given the assumptions in the problem description that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, we can conclude that the function is correct for its intended use case.

Final: **True**
