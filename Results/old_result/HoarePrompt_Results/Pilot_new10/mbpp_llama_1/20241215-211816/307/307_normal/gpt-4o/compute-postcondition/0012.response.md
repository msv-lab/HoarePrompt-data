According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a break statement. Since there are no conditions that would prevent the loop from executing again, no adjustments to the states are needed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3**
