The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` was 3, so the new value of `idx` is 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. The condition regarding the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` and `n` does not impact the execution of the given code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 4, and `triangular_num` is 6. If the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program would return `idx` which is 4, but this return has not occurred yet. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 4, `triangular_num` is 6, and if the length of the string representation of `triangular_num` is greater than or equal to `n`, the program will return `idx` which is 4.**
