The original assessment is "None", which implies a lack of evaluation or judgment on the program's correctness. Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function seems to correctly implement the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with n digits.

The annotated version of the code further supports this understanding by providing a clear explanation of the function's behavior and the state of the program at various points. The function correctly returns the smallest integer k for which the string representation of the k-th triangular number has a length of n.

The only potential issue is that the function does not explicitly handle non-positive integers or non-integers, which could lead to incorrect results or infinite loops for these inputs. However, since we are assuming that the input will always be valid (a positive integer greater than 0), this does not affect the correctness of the program for its intended use case.

Therefore, based on the information available, I believe that the original assessment should be affirmative, as the program appears to be correct based on the problem description and the annotations.

Final: **True**
