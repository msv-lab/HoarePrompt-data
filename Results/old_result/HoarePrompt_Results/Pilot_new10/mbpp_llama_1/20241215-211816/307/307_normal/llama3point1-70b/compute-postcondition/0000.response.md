The given code assigns the value 1 to the variable `idx`. The initial state states that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. This information about `n` is still valid after the code has been executed. The code does not modify the value of `n`, it only introduces a new variable `idx` with the value 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `idx` is 1**
