The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. 

Upon examining the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, we can see that the code accurately implements the described functionality. The function `func_1` takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple with `b` first and `a` second, exactly as specified in the problem description. The output hints also confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns the input numbers in reverse order without any conditions or modifications.

Given this information, it appears that the original assessment was simply a lack of assessment, rather than an incorrect assessment. The provided code and output hints lead us to believe that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
