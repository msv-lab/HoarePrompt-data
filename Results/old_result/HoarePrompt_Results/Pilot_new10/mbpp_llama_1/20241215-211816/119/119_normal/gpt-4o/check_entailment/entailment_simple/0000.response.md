Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple with the second number `b` followed by the first number `a`. 

The return statement `return b, a` directly achieves this by returning a tuple where the first element is `b` (the second input number) and the second element is `a` (the first input number). This operation is independent of the actual values of `a` and `b`, meaning it will work correctly for any pair of numbers.

The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) further validate the correctness of the function by checking its output for different input pairs, ensuring the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. 

Therefore, the program always does what the problem description says, making it correct.
