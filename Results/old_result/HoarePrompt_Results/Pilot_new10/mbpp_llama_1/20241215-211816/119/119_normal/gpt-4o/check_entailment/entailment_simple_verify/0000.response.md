The original assessment is "None", which means there is no initial assessment of the program's correctness. 

The problem description asks for a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number. 

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns a tuple `(b, a)`, which matches the problem description.

The annotated version of the code confirms this by stating that the program returns `b` and `a`, where both `b` and `a` are numbers, which is consistent with the problem description.

Based on the information provided, the program appears to be correct. The function `func_1` takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

Final: **True**
