To determine the correctness of the given Python program, we need to compare what the problem description requires with what the annotated program does.

The problem description asks for a function that takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number first, followed by the first number.

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns them in the order `b, a`. This directly matches the requirement specified in the problem description: taking two numbers (`a` and `b`) and returning them in reverse order as a tuple (`b, a`).

The function does not perform any other operations or checks on the inputs beyond returning them in reverse order. This simplicity ensures that for any two numbers passed to `func_1`, it will return a tuple with the numbers in the reverse order of how they were passed, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

The provided assertions (`assert` statements) further demonstrate the correctness of the function by testing it with different input pairs and verifying that it returns the expected output. These assertions cover various cases and show that the function behaves as expected for different inputs.

Since the function `func_1` adheres to the problem description's requirements without exception and performs the exact operation described for all potential cases (taking two numbers and returning them in reverse order as a tuple), we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
