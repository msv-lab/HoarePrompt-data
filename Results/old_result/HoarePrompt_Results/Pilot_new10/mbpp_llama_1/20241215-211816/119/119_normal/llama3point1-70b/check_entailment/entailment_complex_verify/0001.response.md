Based on the problem description, the program is supposed to return a tuple with the second number and then the first number. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function accepts two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns them in reverse order, with `b` first and `a` second.

The original assessment is "None", which means there is no previous evaluation of the program's correctness. 

However, based on the provided code and annotations, it is clear that the program does indeed return the numbers in the reverse order as required by the problem description.

The code `return b, a` returns a tuple with `b` as the first element and `a` as the second element, which matches the problem description. 

Therefore, the original assessment is considered not applicable in this case, and the final assessment of the program's correctness is based solely on the provided code and annotations.

Final: **True**
