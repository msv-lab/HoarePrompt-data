Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code is correct because it directly addresses the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two numbers `a` and `b` and returns them in reverse order as a tuple `(b, a)`. The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) support this, showing that the function behaves as expected for different input pairs. There are no conditions or operations in the problem description that the code does not fulfill. The output hints also align with the code's behavior, stating that the function returns the inputs in reverse order without performing any checks or operations. Since the code matches the problem description and examples without any apparent deviations or missed cases, it is correct for every potential case as described.
