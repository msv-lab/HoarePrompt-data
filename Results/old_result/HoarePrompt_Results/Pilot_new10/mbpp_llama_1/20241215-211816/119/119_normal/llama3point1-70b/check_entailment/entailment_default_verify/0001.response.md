The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. 

The problem description requires a function that takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple with the second number first and the first number second. 

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes two arguments `a` and `b` and returns a tuple `(b, a)`, which matches the problem description.

The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the input numbers in reverse order without any conditions or modifications.

Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, it appears that the program is correct. The code accurately implements the required functionality, and the output hints support this conclusion.

Final: **True**
