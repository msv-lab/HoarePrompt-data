Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(tup, elem)` correctly counts the occurrences of the element `elem` in the tuple `tup` using the built-in `count` method of Python tuples. This method returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the tuple.

The function does not have any apparent flaws or edge cases that would cause it to fail. It correctly handles:

- Empty tuples: If the tuple is empty, `count` will return 0, which is the correct result.
- Single-element tuples: If the tuple contains only one element, `count` will return 1 if the element matches `elem`, and 0 otherwise.
- Tuples with duplicate elements: `count` will correctly count the occurrences of `elem` even if it appears multiple times in the tuple.
- Tuples with different data types: `count` will work correctly even if the tuple contains elements of different data types, as long as `elem` is of a type that can be compared with the elements of the tuple.

Since the function correctly handles all these cases, and there are no apparent logical errors or missing edge cases, the program is correct.
