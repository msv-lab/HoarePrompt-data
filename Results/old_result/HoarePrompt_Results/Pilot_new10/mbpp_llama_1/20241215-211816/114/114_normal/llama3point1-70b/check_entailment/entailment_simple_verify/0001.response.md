Based on the problem description and the provided code, we can analyze the correctness of the program.

The problem description requires a function that takes in a tuple and an element and counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` and returns the count of `elem` in `tup` using the built-in `count` method of Python tuples.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as input and returns the correct count of `elem` in `tup`.

The original assessment is `None`, which implies that no assessment was made. However, based on the analysis of the problem description and the provided code, we can conclude that the program is correct.

The reason why the original assessment is not applicable is that it was empty, and we had to make our own assessment based on the problem description and the code.

The `count` method of Python tuples is a built-in method that returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the tuple. This method is precise and efficient, making it suitable for this task.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
