Correctness: **True**

The code correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The function `func_1` uses the built-in `count` method of tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of its argument in the tuple. This perfectly aligns with the problem description.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for various scenarios, including when the element is present multiple times, not present, and when the tuple contains various elements. The function behaves as expected based on these tests.

Additionally, the output hints are consistent with the code's behavior. For example, if `tup` is not a tuple, attempting to call `tup.count(element)` would indeed raise an AttributeError because `count` is a method of tuple (and list) objects, not a general method that can be applied to any object. Similarly, if `element` is not a comparable object (which is required for the `count` method to work properly), a TypeError might be raised depending on the nature of the element and how it's compared within the tuple's `count` method.

The hints about returning 0 when `tup` is an empty tuple or `element` is not found in `tup` are also consistent with the behavior of the `count` method, as it returns 0 in such cases.

Given that the code directly and correctly implements the requested functionality and behaves as expected in all described scenarios, there's no indication of incorrect behavior for any potential case as per the problem description.
