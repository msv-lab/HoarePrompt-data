Correctness: **True**

The code appears to be correct and follows the problem description. It takes a tuple `tup` and an `element` as input and returns the number of occurrences of `element` in `tup`. The `count()` method in Python is a built-in method that returns the number of occurrences of a specified element in a tuple. The provided unit tests also suggest that the function behaves as expected, correctly counting the occurrences of different elements in the tuple.

The output hints also agree with the code, stating that the function returns the number of occurrences of `element` in `tup`, raises an AttributeError if `tup` is not a tuple, and raises a TypeError if `element` is not a comparable object. Additionally, the hints mention that the function returns 0 if `tup` is an empty tuple or `element` is not found in `tup`, which is consistent with the behavior of the `count()` method.

Overall, based on the provided code, output hints, and unit tests, it seems that the function behaves correctly and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
