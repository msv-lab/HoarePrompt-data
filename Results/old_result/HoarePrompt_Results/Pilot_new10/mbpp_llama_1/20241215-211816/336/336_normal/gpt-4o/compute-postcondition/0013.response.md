The function func_1 accepts a list of integers lst. It iterates over the list, checking every other element starting from the second one (at index 1). If it finds an even element at an odd index, it immediately returns False. If it checks all elements at odd indices without finding any even ones, it returns True.

Looking at the code, it appears to do what the annotations describe, but there are some edge cases to consider:

- If the list is empty, the function will return True because the loop won't be executed.
- If the list has only one element, the function will return True because the loop starts from the second element (index 1), which doesn't exist in this case.
- If the list has an even number of elements, the function will check all elements at odd indices as expected.
- If the list has an odd number of elements, the function will also work as expected, checking all elements at odd indices.

Considering these cases, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers and returns True if all elements at odd indices in the list are odd, or if the list has less than two elements; otherwise, it returns False as soon as it encounters an even element at an odd index. **
