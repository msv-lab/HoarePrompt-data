The original assessment is `None`, which means there is no prior evaluation of the program's correctness. The annotated version of the code provides a clear explanation of the program's behavior. 

The annotated code suggests that the function `func_1` checks if every odd index in the list contains an odd number. It iterates over the list using a for loop, and for each odd index `i`, it checks if the corresponding value `lst[i]` is even. If it finds an odd index with an even value, it immediately returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding any such indices, it returns `True`.

Based on the problem description, the program seems to be correct. The problem description asks for a function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list. The annotated code explains that the function does exactly that.

Therefore, the original assessment of `None` does not provide any information, but the annotated version of the code confirms that the program is correct according to the problem description.

Final: **True**
