Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it checks if every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. Here's why:

- The function iterates over the list using a for loop with `range(1, len(lst), 2)`, which generates odd indices (1, 3, 5, etc.) because list indices in Python are 0-based.
- Inside the loop, it checks if the element at the current odd index is even using the condition `lst[i] % 2 == 0`. If an even element is found at an odd index, the function immediately returns `False`.
- If the loop completes without finding any even elements at odd indices, the function returns `True`, indicating that all elements at odd indices are odd.
- The provided unit tests (`assert` statements) also validate the function's behavior for different scenarios, including lists with and without even elements at odd indices.

The function's logic aligns with the problem description, and it correctly handles all potential cases. It returns `True` when all elements at odd indices are odd and `False` otherwise, making it a correct implementation according to the given problem description.
