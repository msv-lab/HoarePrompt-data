#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers where all elements at odd indices are odd if the loop completes without returning `False`, otherwise the loop returns `False` as soon as an even element at an odd index is found.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating all elements at odd indices in the list are odd
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns True if all elements at odd indices in the list are odd, or if the list has less than two elements; otherwise, it returns False as soon as it encounters an even element at an odd index.
