Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it checks every odd index of the given list to see if it contains an odd number. Here's a step-by-step breakdown:

1. The function `func_1` iterates over the indices of the list `lst` using a for loop.
2. Inside the loop, it checks two conditions:
   - `i % 2!= 0`: This condition checks if the current index `i` is odd. In Python, list indices start at 0, so the first element is at index 0 (even), the second element is at index 1 (odd), and so on.
   - `lst[i] % 2 == 0`: This condition checks if the value at the current index `i` is even.
3. If both conditions are true (i.e., the index is odd and the value is even), the function immediately returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any odd index with an even value, the function returns `True`, indicating that every odd index contains an odd number.

This program correctly implements the problem description's requirement, which is to check whether every odd index in the list contains an odd number. It covers all potential cases:

- If the list is empty, the loop will not execute, and the function will return `True`, which is correct because there are no odd indices to check.
- If the list contains only one element (at index 0, which is even), the loop will not find any odd index, and the function will return `True`, which is correct because there are no odd indices to check.
- For lists with more than one element, the function correctly checks every odd index and returns `True` if all of them contain odd numbers, and `False` otherwise.
