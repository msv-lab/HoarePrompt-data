Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to be correct and follows the problem description. It checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number by iterating over the list with a step of 2, starting from index 1. If it encounters an even number at an odd index, it immediately returns False. If it successfully checks all odd indices without finding any even numbers, it returns True. 

This approach correctly handles lists of varying lengths and returns True for lists where all elements at odd indices are odd. It also correctly returns False as soon as it encounters an even element at an odd index. The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the code. For example, the code correctly returns True for the lists [2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3] and [4, 1, 2], and False for the list [1, 2, 3]. Additionally, the code will also return True for lists with less than two elements, as there are no odd indices to check in such lists. 

Overall, the code seems to be correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
