Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements in the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The function iterates over the indices of the list using `range(len(lst))`.
2. For each index `i`, it checks if the index is odd (`i % 2!= 0`) and the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
3. If such a case is found, the function immediately returns `False`.
4. If the loop completes without finding any odd index with an even value, the function returns `True`.

This logic covers all potential edge cases:

*   Empty lists: The loop will not execute, and the function will return `True` as expected, since there are no odd indices with even values.
*   Lists of varying lengths and compositions: The function will correctly identify whether every odd index contains an odd number.

The program does not have any obvious flaws or potential cases where it does not follow the problem description. It handles all possible scenarios, including edge cases like empty lists, lists with a single element, and lists with multiple elements. Therefore, it always meets the requirements in the problem description.
