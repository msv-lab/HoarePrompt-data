The code updates the value of `max_list` to be equal to `lst`. The previous values of `list_of_lists`, `lst`, and `max_len` are not affected. `lst` is still the second list in `list_of_lists`, and `max_len` is still equal to the length of `lst`. 

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least 2 lists, `lst` is the second list in `list_of_lists`, `max_len` is equal to `len(lst)`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`**
