To determine the functionality of the function `func_1`, let's break down what the code does step by step, considering the annotations and the actual code logic.

1. The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which, according to the annotations, is expected to be a list containing at least one list. However, the code itself does not enforce this condition; it simply iterates over whatever is passed to it.

2. Inside the function, it initializes two variables: `max_len` to 0 and `max_list` to an empty list. These variables are intended to keep track of the length of the longest list found so far and the longest list itself, respectively.

3. The function then iterates over each list (`lst`) in `list_of_lists`. For each list, it checks if the length of the current list (`len(lst)`) is greater than the current maximum length (`max_len`). If it is, the function updates `max_len` to the length of the current list and sets `max_list` to the current list.

4. After iterating over all lists, the function returns a tuple containing `max_len` (the length of the longest list found) and `max_list` (the longest list itself).

5. The annotations and return postconditions mention that if `list_of_lists` is empty, the function returns 0 and an empty list. This aligns with the code's behavior because if `list_of_lists` is empty, the loop that updates `max_len` and `max_list` never executes, so `max_len` remains 0 and `max_list` remains an empty list by default.

However, the annotations do not cover all potential edge cases, such as what happens if `list_of_lists` contains lists of equal maximum length. In such a case, the function will return the first list it encounters with the maximum length, not necessarily all lists of that maximum length.

Given this analysis, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists and returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the first occurrence of the longest list. If the input list is empty, it returns 0 and an empty list. In cases where multiple lists have the same maximum length, it returns the length and the first list it encounters with that maximum length. **
