According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` has at least 1 list, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `list_of_lists` is a list containing at least one list, `max_len` is 0, and `max_list` is an empty list. For the loop to execute, `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 list and `lst` should be the first list in `list_of_lists`. 

State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least one list, `max_len` is 0, `max_list` is an empty list, `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`**
