The code updates the value of `max_len` to be the length of `lst`. Given that `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists` and its length is greater than the current value of `max_len` (0), `max_len` will now hold the length of the first list in `list_of_lists`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list containing at least one list, `max_len` is the length of the first list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is an empty list, `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list containing at least one list, `max_len` is the length of the first list in `list_of_lists`, `max_list` is an empty list, `lst` is the first list in `list_of_lists`.**
