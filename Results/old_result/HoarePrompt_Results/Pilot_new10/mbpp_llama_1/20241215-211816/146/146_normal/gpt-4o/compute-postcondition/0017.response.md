The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list containing at least one list. After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple. This tuple contains two values: the length of the longest list in `list_of_lists` and the longest list itself. However, there's an exception for when `list_of_lists` is empty, which contradicts the initial parameter constraint that it must contain at least one list. Considering the output description, we should focus on the functional behavior described. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists and return a tuple containing the length of the longest sublist and the longest sublist itself, handling the case where the input list might be empty by returning 0 and an empty list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists, returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself, or returns 0 and an empty list if the input list is empty.**
