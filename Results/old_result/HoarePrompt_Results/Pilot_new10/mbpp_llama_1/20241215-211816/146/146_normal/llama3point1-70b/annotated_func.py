#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #The program returns a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists in 'list_of_lists' and the first sublist from 'list_of_lists' that has this maximum length
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists and returns a tuple containing the maximum length of sublists and the first sublist it encounters with this maximum length. If the input list is empty, the function will throw an error.
