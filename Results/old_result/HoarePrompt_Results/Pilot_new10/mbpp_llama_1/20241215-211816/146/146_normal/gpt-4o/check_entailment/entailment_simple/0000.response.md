Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the longest list itself.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The function initializes two variables: `max_len` to keep track of the maximum length found so far, and `max_list` to store the longest list found so far.
2. It then iterates over each list in the input `list_of_lists`.
3. For each list, it checks if the length of the current list is greater than the current `max_len`. If it is, it updates `max_len` to the length of the current list and sets `max_list` to the current list.
4. After iterating over all lists, the function returns a tuple containing `max_len` and `max_list`.

The program handles the following cases correctly:

* If `list_of_lists` contains at least one list, the function will return the length and the longest list.
* If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will return 0 and an empty list, as specified in the problem description.

The unit tests provided also demonstrate the correctness of the program, as they cover different scenarios and the function returns the expected results.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description and correctly finds the list of maximum length in a list of lists.
