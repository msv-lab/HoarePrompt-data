Correctness: **True**

The given code correctly implements a function to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists. It iterates over each list in the input list of lists and keeps track of the maximum length and the first occurrence of the longest list. 

The function returns a tuple containing the length of the longest list and the first occurrence of the longest list, which aligns with the output hints. 

In cases where multiple lists have the same maximum length, the function returns the length and the first list it encounters with that maximum length, which is also consistent with the output hints and the problem description.

Additionally, the provided unit tests confirm the correctness of the function for various input cases. The function handles lists of varying lengths and returns the expected results.

The code handles the edge case where the input list of lists is empty, although it is not explicitly mentioned in the output hints. In this case, the function will return (0, []) as `max_len` is initialized to 0 and `max_list` is initialized to an empty list.

Overall, the code is correct and provides the expected output for all potential cases, which is confirmed by the unit tests and the consistency with the output hints.
