#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1, list2, and list3 are lists of elements that can be compared for sorting.
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    return sorted_list
    #The program returns a sorted list that contains all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` in a sorted order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three lists of elements, combines them into one list, and returns a new sorted list containing all elements from the input lists in ascending order, assuming the elements can be compared with each other; it does not handle cases where elements are not comparable or where inputs are not lists, and it ignores empty input lists.
