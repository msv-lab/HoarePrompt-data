The original assessment is "None", which means there is no initial assessment provided. Based on the problem description and the provided code, I will evaluate the correctness of the program.

The problem description requires writing a function to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes three lists as input, combines them into a single list using the `+` operator, sorts the combined list using the `sorted` function, and returns the sorted list.

The annotated version of the code provides additional information about the state of the program at different points. Before the function call, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of elements that can be compared for sorting. After the function call, the program returns a sorted list that contains all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` in a sorted order.

Based on the code and the annotations, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality. The `sorted` function is a built-in Python function that sorts the elements of a list in ascending order, which meets the problem's requirement.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations.

Final: **True**
