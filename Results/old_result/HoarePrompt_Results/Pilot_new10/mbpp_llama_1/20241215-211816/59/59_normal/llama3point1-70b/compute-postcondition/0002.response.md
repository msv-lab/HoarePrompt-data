The function `func_1` accepts three lists of comparable elements, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, and returns a single sorted list containing all elements from the input lists in ascending order.

The code line by line does what the annotations say: it concatenates the three input lists using the `+` operator, and then sorts the resulting list using the `sorted` function. The sorted list is then returned by the function.

There are no potential edge cases or missing logic in the code that are not covered by the annotations. The code will work correctly for any input lists of comparable elements, including empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with elements of different data types (as long as the elements are comparable).

However, it's worth noting that the code does not handle the case where the input lists contain non-comparable elements, such as lists of lists or lists of dictionaries. In such cases, the `sorted` function will raise a `TypeError`.
