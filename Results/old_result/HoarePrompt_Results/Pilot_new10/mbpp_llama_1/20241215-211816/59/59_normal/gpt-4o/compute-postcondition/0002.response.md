The `sorted_list` is a sorted list that is equal to `sorted(list1 + list2 + list3)`. Since `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of elements that can be compared for sorting, the `sorted_list` will contain all elements from these three lists in a sorted order. 

Output State: **The program returns a sorted list that contains all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` in a sorted order**
