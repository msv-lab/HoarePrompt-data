Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` takes three lists as input, combines them into a single list using the `+` operator, and then sorts the resulting list in ascending order using the `sorted` function. The output hints agree with the code, stating that the function concatenates the input lists, sorts the resulting list, and returns the sorted list.

The code handles every potential case correctly:

1.  If the input lists are empty, the function returns an empty list.
2.  If the input lists contain only comparable elements, the function returns a sorted list containing all elements from the input lists.
3.  If the input lists contain non-comparable elements, the function will raise a TypeError, which is a reasonable behavior given that it's impossible to compare non-comparable elements.

The function does not have any edge cases that are not handled correctly. It correctly handles lists of different lengths, lists with duplicate elements, and lists with negative or floating-point numbers.

Overall, the code is correct and meets the problem description for every potential case.
