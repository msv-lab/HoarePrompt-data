The code splits the `snake_case_str` into a list of words using the underscore as a separator. 

Since `snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where each word is separated by a single underscore, the `split('_')` function will divide this string into a list of substrings, each representing a word from the original string.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where each word is separated by a single underscore, `words` is a list of strings where each string is a word from `snake_case_str`.

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where each word is separated by a single underscore, `words` is a list of strings where each string is a word from `snake_case_str`.**
