The code defines a new variable `camel_case_str` which is a string where each word from the `words` list is capitalized and joined together. 

`camel_case_str` is assigned the value of the joined string of capitalized words from the `words` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Since `words` is a list of strings where each string is a word from `snake_case_str`, and `snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where each word is separated by a single underscore, `words` will still be a list of strings where each string is a word from `snake_case_str`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where each word is separated by a single underscore, `words` is a list of strings where each string is a word from `snake_case_str`, `camel_case_str` is a string where each word from `words` is capitalized and joined together without any separator.

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where each word is separated by a single underscore, `words` is a list of strings where each string is a word from `snake_case_str`, `camel_case_str` is `''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words)`**
