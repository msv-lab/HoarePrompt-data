The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `snake_case_str`. `snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where each word is separated by a single underscore. The function returns a string in camel case format where the first word is the same as in `snake_case_str` but in lowercase (as it was already in lowercase and there's no indication it should be capitalized), and each subsequent word is capitalized, all joined together without any separators. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string parameter `snake_case_str` and returns a camel case string where the first word remains in lowercase and each subsequent word is capitalized, all joined together without any separators.**
