Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it capitalizes the first word of the snake case string, whereas in camel case, the first word should be in lowercase, and only the subsequent words should be capitalized.

For example, if the input is "hello_world", the program will return "HelloWorld", but the correct camel case string should be "helloWorld".

To fix this, the program should only capitalize the words after the first word. Here's an example of how it could be corrected:

```python
def func_1(snake_case_str):
    words = snake_case_str.split('_')
    camel_case_str = words[0] + ''.join(word.capitalize() for word in words[1:])
    return camel_case_str
```

In this corrected version, `words[0]` is the first word, which is not capitalized, and `words[1:]` are the remaining words, which are capitalized and joined to the first word.
