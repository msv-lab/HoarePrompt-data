You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: snake_case_str is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, where each word is separated by a single underscore.
```
def func_1(snake_case_str):
```
Output: To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the code's impact:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, with each word separated by a single underscore.
   - `words` is a list of strings where each string is a word from `snake_case_str`. This implies that `words` has been split from `snake_case_str` based on the underscore.
   - `camel_case_str` is a string created by joining each word in `words` (which are first capitalized) without any separator.

2. **Code Impact**: 
   - The code `return camel_case_str` simply returns the value of `camel_case_str`.

Given the transformation from `snake_case_str` to `camel_case_str`, we know that each word in `snake_case_str` (separated by underscores) is capitalized and then joined together without any separators to form `camel_case_str`.

**Output State**: **The program returns a camel case string where the first word is the first word of `snake_case_str` capitalized, and each subsequent word is also capitalized, all joined together without any separators.**

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
