To determine the output state, let's break down the given information and the code's impact:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `snake_case_str` is a string containing only lowercase letters, digits, and underscores, with each word separated by a single underscore.
   - `words` is a list of strings where each string is a word from `snake_case_str`. This implies that `words` has been split from `snake_case_str` based on the underscore.
   - `camel_case_str` is a string created by joining each word in `words` (which are first capitalized) without any separator.

2. **Code Impact**: 
   - The code `return camel_case_str` simply returns the value of `camel_case_str`.

Given the transformation from `snake_case_str` to `camel_case_str`, we know that each word in `snake_case_str` (separated by underscores) is capitalized and then joined together without any separators to form `camel_case_str`.

**Output State**: **The program returns a camel case string where the first word is the first word of `snake_case_str` capitalized, and each subsequent word is also capitalized, all joined together without any separators.**
