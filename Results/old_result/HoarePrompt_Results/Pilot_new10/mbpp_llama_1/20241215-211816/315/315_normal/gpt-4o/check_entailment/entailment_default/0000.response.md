Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code is correct because it successfully adds the given tuple to the given list for every potential case. The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the tuple converted to a list. The line `return lst + list(tpl)` achieves this by first converting the tuple to a list using `list(tpl)`, and then concatenating it with the input list using the `+` operator.

The provided unit tests, such as `assert func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`, demonstrate the function's correctness. Additionally, the output hints accurately describe the function's behavior, stating that it returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the tuple converted to a list.

The function works correctly for various input cases, including different list and tuple lengths, and edge cases such as empty lists or tuples. For example, `func_1([], (1, 2))` would correctly return `[1, 2]`, and `func_1([1, 2], ())` would correctly return `[1, 2]`.

Overall, the code correctly implements the problem description, and there are no apparent cases where the function does not work as expected.
