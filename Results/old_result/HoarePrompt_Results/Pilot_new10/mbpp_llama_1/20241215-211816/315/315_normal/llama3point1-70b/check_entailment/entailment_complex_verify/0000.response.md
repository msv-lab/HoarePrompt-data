The original assessment is "None", indicating that no initial assessment was provided. To evaluate the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, let's analyze the information given:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that adds a given tuple to a given list.
2. **Program**: The function `func_1` takes an input list and an input tuple, converts the tuple into a list, and then concatenates (adds) this list to the original input list using the `+` operator. The result is a new list that combines all elements from the original list and the tuple.

3. **Annotated Code**: The annotations clarify that before the function is called, `input_list` is indeed a list and `input_tuple` is a tuple. The function returns a list that is a combination of the original list and the elements of the tuple, effectively achieving the goal described in the problem statement.

Given the information above, the program does what it is supposed to do according to the problem description. It correctly combines the elements of the input list and the input tuple into a new list, which is then returned. The annotations support this interpretation by explaining the state of the program and the outcome of the function call.

There is no indication from the problem description or the annotations that the program fails to meet its intended purpose. Therefore, based on the provided information and following the strict assumption that the inputs will always be valid (i.e., a list and a tuple), the program is correct.

Final: **True**
