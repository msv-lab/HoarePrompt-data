To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it based on the problem description and the provided annotations.

**Problem Description:** The task is to write a function that adds a given tuple to a given list.

**Program Analysis:**

The provided function, `func_1`, takes two parameters: `lst` (a list) and `tpl` (a tuple). It returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl` converted to a list.

Here is the key part of the function:
```python
return lst + list(tpl)
```
This line of code does the following:
1. Converts the tuple `tpl` to a list using `list(tpl)`.
2. Concatenates the original list `lst` with the list version of `tpl` using the `+` operator, which for lists in Python means extending the first list with the elements of the second list.

**Correctness Evaluation:**

Based on the problem description, the function should add the elements of the tuple to the list. The provided implementation achieves this by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the original list. This process effectively "adds" the tuple's elements to the list, as required.

The assertions provided in the annotated program demonstrate the function's correctness for specific cases:
- `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10)) == [5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`
- `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11)) == [6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`
- `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12)) == [7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`

These examples show the function behaving as expected according to the problem description.

**Conclusion:**

Given that the function does indeed add the elements of the tuple to the list for all the provided test cases, and considering the general operation of the function, it can be concluded that the function behaves as intended by the problem description. It correctly adds a given tuple to a given list by converting the tuple to a list and concatenating it with the original list.

Correctness: **True**
