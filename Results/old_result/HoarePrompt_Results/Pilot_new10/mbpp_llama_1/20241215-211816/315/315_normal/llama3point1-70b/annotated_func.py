#State of the program right berfore the function call: input_list is a list and input_tuple is a tuple.
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + list(input_tuple)
    #The program returns a list that is a combination of the original list 'input_list' and the elements of 'input_tuple'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list and a tuple as parameters and returns a new list that is the combination of the elements in the input list and the input tuple, provided that the inputs are indeed a list and a tuple.
