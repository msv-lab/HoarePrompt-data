Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description because it does not add the tuple to the list, but instead, it converts the tuple to a list and then combines the two lists. According to the problem description, the task is to "add the given tuple to the given list". This implies that the tuple should be added as a single element to the list, not that its elements should be added to the list.

To illustrate this, let's consider an example:

```python
input_list = [1, 2, 3]
input_tuple = (4, 5)

result = func_1(input_list, input_tuple)
print(result)  # Output: [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
```

As you can see, the result is a list where the elements of the tuple are added to the list, but the problem description asks to add the tuple itself to the list. The correct output should be:

```
[1, 2, 3, (4, 5)]
```

To achieve this, the function should be modified to append the tuple to the list, like this:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```

Or, if you want to avoid modifying the original list, you can create a new list and append the tuple to it:

```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    return input_list + [input_tuple]
```
