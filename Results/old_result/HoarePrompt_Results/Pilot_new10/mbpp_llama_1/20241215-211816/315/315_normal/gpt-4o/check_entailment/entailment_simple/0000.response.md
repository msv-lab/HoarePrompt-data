Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description because it correctly adds the given tuple to the given list. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `lst` (a list) and `tpl` (a tuple).
2. It returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl` converted to a list using the `list()` function.
3. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the two lists, which results in a new list containing all elements from both lists.

This meets the problem description, which asks to add the given tuple to the given list. The program correctly handles the conversion of the tuple to a list and then concatenates it with the original list.

The unit tests provided also support the correctness of the program, as they demonstrate the expected behavior for different input scenarios. For example:

* `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))` returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`, which is the expected result of adding the tuple `(9, 10)` to the list `[5, 6, 7]`.
* `func_1([6, 7, 8], (10, 11))` returns `[6, 7, 8, 10, 11]`, which is the expected result of adding the tuple `(10, 11)` to the list `[6, 7, 8]`.
* `func_1([7, 8, 9], (11, 12))` returns `[7, 8, 9, 11, 12]`, which is the expected result of adding the tuple `(11, 12)` to the list `[7, 8, 9]`.

Overall, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, and therefore, its correctness is **True**.
