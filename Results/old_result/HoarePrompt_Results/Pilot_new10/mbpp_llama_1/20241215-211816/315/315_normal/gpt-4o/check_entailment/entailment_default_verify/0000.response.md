Based on the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is "None", which means there is no initial assessment to evaluate. However, we can directly assess the correctness of the program.

The problem description requires writing a function to add the given tuple to the given list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, converts the tuple to a list using `list(tpl)`, and then concatenates it to the input list using the `+` operator.

The output hints suggest that the function returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the tuple converted to a list, which aligns with the problem description.

Upon reviewing the code, it appears to correctly implement the required functionality. The function creates a new list by concatenating the input list and the tuple (converted to a list), which meets the problem's requirements.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Final: **True**
