Correctness: **False**.

The given function does not add the tuple to the list, but rather converts the tuple to a list and then concatenates it to the input list. This means the original list remains unchanged. 

For example, if we call the function with the following inputs:
```python
input_list = [1, 2, 3]
input_tuple = (4, 5, 6)
result = func_1(input_list, input_tuple)
print(input_list)  # prints: [1, 2, 3]
```
As we can see, the original list `input_list` remains unchanged. The function returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the input tuple converted to a list, but it does not modify the original list. 

A correct implementation of the function would modify the original list by appending the tuple to it. Here's an example of how it could be done:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.append(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```
Alternatively, if the intention is to add the elements of the tuple to the list, not the tuple itself, the function could be modified as follows:
```python
def func_1(input_list, input_tuple):
    input_list.extend(input_tuple)
    return input_list
```
