To verify the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, we need to check if the function filters odd numbers from a given list as required.

The problem description asks for a function to filter odd numbers, implying that it should take a list of integers as input and return a list containing only the odd integers from that list.

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing only the numbers from the input list `nums` where `num % 2!= 0`, which is the condition for a number to be odd.

```python
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2!= 0]
```

This function indeed filters out the even numbers and returns a list of odd numbers from the input list. It also handles edge cases such as:

- An empty list: If `nums` is an empty list `[]`, the function will correctly return an empty list `[]` because there are no numbers to filter.
- A list with only even numbers: If all numbers in the `nums` list are even, the function will correctly return an empty list `[]` because no odd numbers are found.

However, the function may not behave as expected in cases where the input list contains non-integer values or if the input is `None`, as mentioned in the annotations. For example:

- If `nums` contains a float or a string that cannot be evaluated as an integer (e.g., `nums = [1, 2, 'a']`), attempting to use the modulus operator (`%`) on such values will raise a `TypeError`.
- If `nums` is `None`, attempting to iterate over `None` will raise a `TypeError`.

Despite these potential issues, the problem description specifically asks to filter odd numbers, and the function provided does exactly that for lists containing integers. It does not explicitly require the function to handle non-integer or `None` inputs in a specific way.

Given the strict interpretation of the problem description provided, the function performs the task of filtering odd numbers from a list of integers as required.

Correctness: **True**
