Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct because it filters out the odd numbers from the input list `nums` and returns them in a new list. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the problem description:

1. The function takes a list of integers `nums` as input.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number `num` in the input list.
3. The condition `num % 2!= 0` checks whether a number is odd (i.e., the remainder of dividing the number by 2 is not 0). If this condition is true, the number is included in the output list.
4. The function returns the resulting list of odd integers.

This program will work correctly for all potential cases, including:

* Empty input lists: The function will return an empty list, which is the expected result.
* Lists with only even numbers: The function will return an empty list, which is the expected result.
* Lists with only odd numbers: The function will return the original list, which is the expected result.
* Lists with a mix of even and odd numbers: The function will return a list containing only the odd numbers, which is the expected result.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description, and therefore, its correctness is **True**.
