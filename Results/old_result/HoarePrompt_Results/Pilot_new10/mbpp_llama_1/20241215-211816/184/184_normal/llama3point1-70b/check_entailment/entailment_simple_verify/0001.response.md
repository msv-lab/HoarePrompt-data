The original assessment correctly evaluates the provided Python function, `func_1`, which is designed to filter odd numbers from a given list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to create a new list that includes only the numbers for which `num % 2!= 0`, which is the condition for a number to be odd. 

The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment by providing the state of the program right before the function call and after the function execution. The annotation indicates that `nums` is a list of integers before the function call and that the program returns a list of odd integers from the `nums` list, which aligns with the problem description.

The original assessment correctly identifies and handles various potential cases, including an empty list, a list with only even numbers, a list with only odd numbers, and a list with mixed numbers. This comprehensive evaluation suggests that the function correctly implements the described functionality without any discernible edge cases that it fails to handle.

Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is aligned with the original assessment. The reason for maintaining the original assessment is that both the provided code and the annotated version align with the problem description and handle various potential cases correctly.

Final: **True**
