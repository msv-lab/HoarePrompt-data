Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` filters odd numbers from a given list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums`. If a number `num` is odd (i.e., `num % 2!= 0`), it is included in the output list.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: `func_1([])` returns an empty list, as expected.
- Lists with only even numbers: `func_1([2, 4, 6])` returns an empty list, as expected.
- Lists with only odd numbers: `func_1([1, 3, 5])` returns the list `[1, 3, 5]`, as expected.
- Lists with a mix of even and odd numbers: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns the list `[1, 3, 5]`, as expected.
- Lists with negative numbers: `func_1([-1, -2, -3])` returns the list `[-1, -3]`, as expected.
- Lists with floating-point numbers: `func_1([1.5, 2.5, 3.5])` returns the list `[1.5, 2.5, 3.5]`, as expected.

The function does not handle non-numeric inputs, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description. If the problem description were to include non-numeric inputs, the function would need to be modified to handle such cases. However, based on the provided problem description and the code, the function works correctly for all potential cases involving numeric inputs.
