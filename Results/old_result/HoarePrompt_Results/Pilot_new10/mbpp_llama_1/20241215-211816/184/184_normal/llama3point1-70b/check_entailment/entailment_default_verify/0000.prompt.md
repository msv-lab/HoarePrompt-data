You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to filter odd numbers.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` filters odd numbers from a given list of numbers. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums`. If a number `num` is odd (i.e., `num % 2!= 0`), it is included in the output list.

This function works correctly for all potential cases, including:

- Empty lists: `func_1([])` returns an empty list, as expected.
- Lists with only even numbers: `func_1([2, 4, 6])` returns an empty list, as expected.
- Lists with only odd numbers: `func_1([1, 3, 5])` returns the list `[1, 3, 5]`, as expected.
- Lists with a mix of even and odd numbers: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns the list `[1, 3, 5]`, as expected.
- Lists with negative numbers: `func_1([-1, -2, -3])` returns the list `[-1, -3]`, as expected.
- Lists with floating-point numbers: `func_1([1.5, 2.5, 3.5])` returns the list `[1.5, 2.5, 3.5]`, as expected.

The function does not handle non-numeric inputs, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description. If the problem description were to include non-numeric inputs, the function would need to be modified to handle such cases. However, based on the provided problem description and the code, the function works correctly for all potential cases involving numeric inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: The function accepts a list of integers, returns a list of odd integers from the input list, and handles edge cases such as empty lists or lists with only even numbers by returning an empty list, but may raise errors or behave unexpectedly with non-integer values or None input.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
