Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a function `func_1` that filters out odd numbers from a given list of integers. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `nums` and includes a number in the output list if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2!= 0`).

Upon analyzing the code, it appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The output hints also agree with the code's behavior, mentioning that it handles edge cases such as empty lists or lists with only even numbers by returning an empty list.

However, it is worth noting that the function may raise errors or behave unexpectedly with non-integer values or None input, as mentioned in the output hints. But since the problem statement does not explicitly require the function to handle these cases, we can assume that the input will always be a list of integers.

Given the provided information, the code seems to correctly filter out odd numbers for every potential case, and therefore, its correctness is **True**. 

To further improve the function and make it more robust, you could add error checking to handle potential edge cases, such as:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not isinstance(nums, list):
        raise ValueError("Input must be a list")
    return [num for num in nums if isinstance(num, int) and num % 2!= 0]
```

This version of the function includes checks to ensure that the input is a list and that each element in the list is an integer before attempting to filter out odd numbers.
