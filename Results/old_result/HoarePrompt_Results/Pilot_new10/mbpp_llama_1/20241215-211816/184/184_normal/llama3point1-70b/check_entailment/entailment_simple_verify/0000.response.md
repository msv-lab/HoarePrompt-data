Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment seems to be accurate. The function `func_1` correctly filters odd numbers from a given list of numbers. The annotated version of the code confirms this, as it returns a list of odd integers from the input list `nums`.

The original assessment provided several test cases to demonstrate the correctness of the function, including empty lists, lists with only even numbers, lists with only odd numbers, and lists with a mix of even and odd numbers. The assessment also noted that the function does not handle non-numeric inputs, but this is not a problem given the assumption that the input will be valid.

The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment, as it states that the program returns a list of odd integers from the `nums` list. The annotation before the function call also confirms that `nums` is a list of integers, which is consistent with the assumption of valid input.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.

Final: **True**
