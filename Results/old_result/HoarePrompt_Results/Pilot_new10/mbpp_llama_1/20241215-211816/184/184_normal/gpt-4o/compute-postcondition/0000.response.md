The code is returning a list of integers from the original list `nums` where each integer `num` satisfies the condition `num % 2!= 0`. This condition is true for odd numbers. 

So, the program returns a list of odd integers that are present in the list `nums`.

Output State: **The program returns a list of odd integers from the list 'nums'**
