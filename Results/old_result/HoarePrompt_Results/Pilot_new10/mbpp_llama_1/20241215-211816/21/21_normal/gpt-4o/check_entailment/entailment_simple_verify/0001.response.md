The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial evaluation of the program's correctness. 

Looking at the problem description, the task is to write a Python function to find the smallest number in a list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in the list.

The annotated version of the code indicates that the state of the program right before the function call is that `lst` is a non-empty list of integers, and the program returns the smallest integer in the list `lst`.

Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to be correct. The `min` function in Python returns the smallest item in an iterable (in this case, a list of integers), which meets the problem's requirements. The annotations provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected.

Therefore, there is no reason to believe that the original assessment (or lack thereof) is not accurate in this case, as the code provided does indeed solve the problem as described.

Final: **True**
