The original assessment is "None", indicating that there was no initial assessment of the program's correctness. 

The problem description is to write a Python function to find the smallest number in a list. The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of numbers `nums` as input and returns the smallest number in the list using the built-in `min` function.

The annotated code confirms that the function is designed to work with a non-empty list of numbers and returns the smallest number in the list. 

Based on the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to be correct. The `min` function is a built-in Python function that returns the smallest item in an iterable (such as a list), which aligns with the problem description. The annotated code also supports this, indicating that the program returns the smallest number in the list.

The assumption that the input will be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of numbers) is reasonable, as the problem statement does not specify handling invalid inputs.

Therefore, the original assessment of "None" is not applicable, but based on the provided information, the program's correctness can be assessed as follows:

Final: **True**
