Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1(nums)` uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in a list. This function is designed to return the smallest item in an iterable (such as a list) or the smallest of two or more arguments. 

The program works correctly for all potential cases, including:

* Lists with positive and negative numbers
* Lists with duplicate smallest numbers
* Lists with a single element
* Lists with all elements being the same

There are no edge cases that the function does not handle correctly. For example, if the input list is empty, the `min()` function will raise a `ValueError`, which is the expected behavior. 

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the problem description. 

However, it's worth noting that if the program is supposed to handle the case where the input list is empty and return a specific value (such as `None` or a custom message), then the current implementation is incorrect. But based on the standard behavior of the `min()` function, the program is correct. 

Example usage:
```python
print(func_1([1, 2, 3]))  # Output: 1
print(func_1([-1, -2, -3]))  # Output: -3
print(func_1([5, 5, 5]))  # Output: 5
print(func_1([10]))  # Output: 10
```
