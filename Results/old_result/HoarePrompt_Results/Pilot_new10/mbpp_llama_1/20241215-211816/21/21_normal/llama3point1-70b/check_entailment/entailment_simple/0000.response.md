Correctness: **True**

The given Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It takes a non-empty list of numbers `nums` as input and returns the smallest number in the list.

The function uses the built-in `min` function in Python, which returns the smallest item in an iterable, such as a list. This ensures that the function will always return the smallest number in the list, regardless of the size of the list or the values it contains.

The pre-condition mentioned in the program, which states that `nums` is a non-empty list of numbers, guarantees that the `min` function will not raise a `ValueError`, which would occur if the list were empty.

Therefore, the function `func_1` is a correct implementation of the problem description, and it will always return the smallest number in the list for every potential case. 

Example use cases:
```python
print(func_1([5, 2, 8, 1]))  # Output: 1
print(func_1([10, 20, 30, 40]))  # Output: 10
print(func_1([-1, 0, 1]))  # Output: -1
```
