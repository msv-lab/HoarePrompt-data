Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function `func_1` uses the built-in `min` function to find the smallest number in a list. This function is designed to return the smallest item in an iterable (such as a list) or the smallest of two or more arguments.

The function meets the requirements of the problem description as it correctly returns the smallest number from the list for all potential cases. 

Here are a few reasons why this code is correct:

1.  **Handling empty lists**: However, the code does not have error checking for empty lists. If an empty list is passed to the function, it will raise a `ValueError` exception because the `min` function cannot find the smallest item in an empty sequence. This is a potential edge case that the code does not handle.

2.  **Non-numeric values**: Another edge case is if the list contains non-numeric values. The `min` function can handle non-numeric values, but it may not behave as expected. For example, if the list contains a mix of numbers and strings, the `min` function will return the smallest string, not the smallest number.

3.  **Handling duplicate smallest numbers**: If there are multiple instances of the smallest number in the list, the function will still return the correct smallest number. This is because the `min` function returns the first smallest item it finds.

4.  **Handling negative numbers and zero**: The function correctly handles negative numbers and zero as the smallest number in the list.

In general, this code is correct for lists containing only numbers, but it may not behave as expected for lists containing non-numeric values or empty lists.

It would be more robust to add error checking code to handle these edge cases, such as checking if the list is empty before trying to find the smallest number, or checking if all elements in the list are numbers before trying to find the smallest number.

Here is a version of the function with error checking:
```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        raise ValueError("List is empty")
    if not all(isinstance(x, (int, float)) for x in lst):
        raise ValueError("List contains non-numeric values")
    return min(lst)
```
With these checks in place, the function is more robust and will behave correctly for a wider range of inputs.
