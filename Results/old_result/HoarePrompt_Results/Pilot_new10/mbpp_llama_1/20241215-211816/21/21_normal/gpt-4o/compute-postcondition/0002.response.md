The function `func_1` accepts a non-empty list of integers `lst` and returns the smallest integer in the list. 

Looking at the code, it simply calls the built-in `min()` function on the input list `lst` and returns the result. This means that the function does not perform any error checking, so if `lst` is an empty list, the function will raise a `ValueError`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to return the smallest integer in the list `lst` if it is non-empty, and raise a `ValueError` if the list is empty.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers and returns the smallest integer in the list if it is non-empty, or raises a ValueError if the list is empty **
