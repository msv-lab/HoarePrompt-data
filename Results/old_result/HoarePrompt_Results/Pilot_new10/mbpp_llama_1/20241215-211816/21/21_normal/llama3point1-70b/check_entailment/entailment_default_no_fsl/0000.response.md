Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the list is empty, as it throws a ValueError. Additionally, it does not handle the case where the list contains non-numeric values, as it throws a TypeError. The problem description asks for a function that finds the smallest number in a list, but it does not explicitly specify what to do in these edge cases. However, a robust solution should ideally handle these cases.

For example, if we call the function with an empty list, `func_1([])`, it will throw a ValueError, but a more correct implementation might return a specific value, such as `None` or a message indicating that the list is empty. Similarly, if we call the function with a list containing non-numeric values, `func_1([1, 2, 'a', 3])`, it will throw a TypeError, but a more correct implementation might ignore the non-numeric values or raise a more informative error.

Here's an example of how the function could be modified to handle these edge cases:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return None
    try:
        return min(num for num in nums if isinstance(num, (int, float)))
    except ValueError:
        return None
```

This modified function returns `None` if the list is empty or if all elements in the list are non-numeric. It also ignores non-numeric values when finding the smallest number.
