#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a non-empty list of numbers.
def func_1(nums):
    return min(nums)
    #The program returns the smallest number in the list 'nums'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers `nums` and returns the smallest number in the list. However, if the list is empty, it throws a ValueError, and if the list contains non-numeric values, it throws a TypeError.
