Based on the provided problem description, the program, and the annotated version, it is clear that the program is designed to find the smallest number in a list of integers.

The original assessment is "None", which means there was no initial judgment made about the program's correctness.

The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` is intended to accept a non-empty list of integers and return the smallest integer in the list. The `min` function in Python is used to achieve this, which is a straightforward and correct approach.

However, the annotated code mentions that if the list is empty, the function will raise a `ValueError`. This is a correct statement because the `min` function in Python does raise a `ValueError` when given an empty sequence.

Considering the problem description and the provided code, the program appears to be correct. The function `func_1` correctly uses the `min` function to find the smallest number in a list of integers, and the annotated version accurately describes its behavior.

The assumption that the input will always be valid (i.e., a non-empty list of integers) means that potential edge cases (like an empty list) are not considered errors in this context.

Given all the information, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**
