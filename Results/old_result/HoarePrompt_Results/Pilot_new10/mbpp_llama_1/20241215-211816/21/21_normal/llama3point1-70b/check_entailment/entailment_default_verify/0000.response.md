To determine the final correctness of the program based on the problem description, let's analyze the information available.

The problem description asks for a Python function to find the smallest number in a list. The provided program defines a function `func_1(nums)` that uses the built-in `min()` function to find the smallest number in the list `nums`.

The original assessment is `None`, which means there's no initial judgment on the program's correctness.

The output hints provide additional insight into the function's behavior:
- It accepts a non-empty list of numbers and returns the smallest number.
- It throws a `ValueError` if the list is empty.
- It throws a `TypeError` if the list contains non-numeric values.

Given these hints, we can see that the function does indeed find the smallest number in a list of numbers, which aligns with the problem description. However, the problem description does not explicitly mention how to handle empty lists or lists with non-numeric values, but given the constraints that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program, the function's behavior as described by the output hints is reasonable and does not inherently contradict the problem statement.

The reason for potential concern could be the handling of edge cases (empty lists, non-numeric values), but since we assume valid input, the primary functionality of finding the smallest number in a list is correctly implemented.

Therefore, based on the given problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, and considering that we assume valid input, the program is correct for its intended purpose.

Final: **True**
