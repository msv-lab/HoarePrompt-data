Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input is not a single character or not a string at all. The `ord()` function in Python throws an error if the input is not a single character. For example, if the input is a string with multiple characters, a number, or any other non-string input, the function will throw an error. 

To fix this issue, the function should include error checking to ensure that the input is a single character. Here's an example of how the function could be modified to handle these cases:

```python
def func_1(char):
    if isinstance(char, str) and len(char) == 1:
        return ord(char)
    else:
        raise ValueError("Input must be a single character")
```

This modified function will raise a `ValueError` if the input is not a single character, instead of throwing an error. This makes it clearer to the user what the problem is and how to fix it.
