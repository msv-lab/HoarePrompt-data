Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` takes a character as input and returns its ASCII value using the built-in `ord` function. This function works correctly for all potential cases, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

The `ord` function is a built-in Python function that returns an integer representing the Unicode character. Since ASCII is a subset of Unicode, `ord` correctly returns the ASCII value for ASCII characters.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness for specific characters, but it can be inferred that the function works for all possible input characters. There are no known edge cases that would cause the function to fail, and the function does not contain any logic that could potentially lead to incorrect results.

Therefore, based on the analysis, the function meets the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
