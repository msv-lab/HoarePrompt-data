Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly returns the ASCII value of a given character. The `ord()` function in Python is specifically designed to return the Unicode code point for a one-character string, which for ASCII characters corresponds to their ASCII value.

The function is designed to take a single character as input and returns an integer value representing the ASCII value of the character. This matches the problem description precisely. 

In every potential case, the function should work as expected because the `ord()` function can handle any character, including letters (both uppercase and lowercase), digits, punctuation marks, and whitespace characters, as long as the input is a single character. 

If the input were not a single character (e.g., a string of length greater than 1 or an empty string), the function might not behave as described or expected, but based on the provided problem description, it's assumed that the input will be a single character, and the function handles this case correctly. 

Therefore, without considering edge cases such as non-string inputs or strings of lengths other than 1 (which are not specified in the problem description), the function does what it's supposed to do according to the description provided.
