Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in Python function `ord()` to find the ASCII value of a character. This function works correctly for all possible input characters, including uppercase and lowercase letters, digits, and special characters.

The `ord()` function returns an integer representing the Unicode character, and since ASCII is a subset of Unicode, it correctly returns the ASCII value for ASCII characters. The unit tests provided, such as `assert func_1('A') == 65`, `assert func_1('R') == 82`, and `assert func_1('S') == 83`, demonstrate the function's correctness for specific cases.

In general, for any input character `char`, `ord(char)` will return its corresponding ASCII value. This function does not have any edge cases where it fails to work as expected, making it correct according to the problem description. 

However, it's worth noting that this function does not include any error checking. If the input is not a single character, the function may not behave as expected. For example, if the input is a string of length greater than 1, or if the input is not a string at all, the function may raise an error or return an incorrect result. But based on the given unit tests and the problem description, the function seems to be correct. 

To make the function more robust, you could add error checking to ensure that the input is a single character. But based on the provided information, the function is correct as it is.
