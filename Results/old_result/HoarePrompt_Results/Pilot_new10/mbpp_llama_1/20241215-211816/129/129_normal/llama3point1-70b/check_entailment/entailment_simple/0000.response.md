To determine the correctness of the provided Python function based on the problem description, let's analyze both the problem description and the function's behavior.

The problem description requires writing a function to find the ASCII value of a character. 

The provided function, `func_1`, takes a character as input and returns its Unicode code point using the `ord()` function. In Python, the `ord()` function returns an integer representing the Unicode character.

Here's the key point: for characters that are part of the ASCII character set (which includes all characters with ASCII values from 0 to 127), the Unicode code point is identical to the ASCII value. Therefore, for any single character that is part of the ASCII set, `func_1` correctly returns its ASCII value.

However, the function does not explicitly check if the input character is within the ASCII range. Yet, since the problem description does not specify that the function should only work for ASCII characters or how it should handle non-ASCII characters, and given that the Unicode code point for ASCII characters is their ASCII value, the function can be considered correct in the context provided.

The only potential issue could arise if one interprets the problem description as requiring the function to work exclusively with ASCII characters (values 0-127) and possibly handle non-ASCII characters differently (e.g., by raising an error). In such a strict interpretation, if the input string contains a character outside the ASCII range, the function would still return a value, but it would be the Unicode code point for that character, not its ASCII value (since it doesn't have one).

Given the information provided and the common understanding of the terms, the function does meet the basic requirement of the problem description for characters within the ASCII range and does so in a way that's generally consistent with how ASCII values are handled in programming contexts where Unicode is the underlying character encoding.

Correctness: **True**
