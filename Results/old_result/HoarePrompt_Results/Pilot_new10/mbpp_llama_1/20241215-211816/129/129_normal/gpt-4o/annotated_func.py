#State of the program right berfore the function call: char is a single character.
def func_1(char):
    return ord(char)
    #The program returns the Unicode value of the single character 'char'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter and returns its Unicode value if it is a single character, but it may throw an error if the input is not a single character or not a string at all.
