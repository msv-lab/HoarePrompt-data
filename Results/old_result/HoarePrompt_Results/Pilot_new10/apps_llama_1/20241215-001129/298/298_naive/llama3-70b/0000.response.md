Correctness: **False**.

The program is trying to find three points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) such that the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to (n*m)/k. 

However, the issue with the given program is that it does not correctly handle all cases. The program only checks if n*m is divisible by k, and if it is, it tries to find two points on the x and y axes. But this approach is not sufficient to guarantee that the area of the triangle formed by these points is (n*m)/k.

A counterexample can be constructed as follows:

Input: n = 5, m = 3, k = 1

The program will print 'YES' and the points (0, 0), (0, 15), (3, 0). But the area of the triangle formed by these points is (1/2)*15*3 = 22.5, which is not equal to (5*3)/1 = 15.

The issue here is that the program is using the extended Euclidean algorithm to find the coefficients x and y such that x*n + y*m = gcd(n, m), but this is not sufficient to guarantee that the area of the triangle is (n*m)/k.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider all possible combinations of points (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3) and check if the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to (n*m)/k.

In conclusion, the given program does not correctly solve the problem, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
