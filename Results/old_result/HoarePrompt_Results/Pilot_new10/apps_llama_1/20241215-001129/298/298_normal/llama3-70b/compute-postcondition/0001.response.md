Given the initial state and the code snippet, we can analyze the output as follows:

- `a` and `b` are integers.
- `x` and `y` are the return values of `func_2(a, b)`. Since we don't have the definition of `func_2`, we can't determine the exact values of `x` and `y`, but we know they are returned by this function based on the inputs `a` and `b`.
- The code returns `x`, `y`, and the result of `x * a + y * b`.

Therefore, the program returns `x` and `y`, which are the return values of `func_2(a, b)` (with `a` and `b` being integers), and the result of the expression `x * a + y * b`, which involves the product of `x` with integer `a`, `y` with integer `b`, and the sum of these two products.

Output State: **The program returns x, y (which are return values of func_2(a, b) where a and b are integers), and the value of x * a + y * b**
