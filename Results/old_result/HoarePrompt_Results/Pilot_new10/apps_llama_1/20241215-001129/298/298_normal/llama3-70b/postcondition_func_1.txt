The function accepts two integers `a` and `b` and returns a tuple of two integers representing the coefficients `x` and `y` in the linear Diophantine equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, using the Extended Euclidean Algorithm, with `x` and `y` calculated based on recursive calls and the specific case handling when `b` is 0, assuming `a` and `b` are non-zero to ensure meaningful results, but does not explicitly handle cases where `a` or `b` is negative, or where both are zero, and does not account for potential overflow issues.
