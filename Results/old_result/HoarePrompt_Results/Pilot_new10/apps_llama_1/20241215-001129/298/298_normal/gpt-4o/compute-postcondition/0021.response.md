Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, `area` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed, and 2 * `area` is larger than `n`. If 2 * `area` is less than or equal to `m`, then '1 ` followed by the value of `2 * area` has been printed and '1 0' has been printed. Otherwise, '0 0' has been printed twice, `f'{n} {m // 2}'` has been printed, and `f'0 {m // 2}'` has been printed twice.**
