The function `func` accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` as input from the user, where `1 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `2 <= k <= 10^9`. It calculates the area as `n * m / k` and checks if the area is a whole number. If the area is not a whole number or is 0, it prints 'NO'. If the area is a non-zero whole number, it prints 'YES' and '0 0', followed by additional coordinates based on the value of `2 * area` relative to `n` and `m`. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, and `k` as input, calculates the area as `n * m / k`, and prints 'NO' if the area is not a whole number or is 0. If the area is a non-zero whole number, it prints 'YES', '0 0', and additional coordinates based on the value of `2 * area` relative to `n` and `m`. Specifically, if `2 * area` is less than or equal to `n`, it prints `f'{2 * area} 1'` and '0 1'. If `2 * area` is less than or equal to `m` but larger than `n`, it prints '1 ' followed by the value of `2 * area` and '1 0'. If `2 * area` is larger than both `n` and `m`, it prints `f'{n} {m // 2}'` and `f'0 {m // 2}'`. **
