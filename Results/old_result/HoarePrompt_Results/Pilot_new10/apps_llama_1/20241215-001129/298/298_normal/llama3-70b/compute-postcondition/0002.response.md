The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are integers. These integers are related to the coordinates of points used to calculate the area of a triangle. After executing the function body, the function returns the values `x` and `y` (which are obtained from another function `func_2(a, b)`) and the calculated value of `x * a + y * b`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, returns the values `x` and `y` (obtained from `func_2(a, b)`), and the calculated value of `x * a + y * b`.**
