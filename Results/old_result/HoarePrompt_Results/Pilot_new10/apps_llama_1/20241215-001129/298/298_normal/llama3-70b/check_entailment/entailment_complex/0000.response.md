Correctness: **False**

The code attempts to find three points that form a triangle with an area equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$, but it does not cover all possible cases. The function `func_3(a, b)` returns values that are used to calculate the coordinates of the points, but it does not guarantee that these points will always form a valid triangle. 

The code uses the Extended Euclidean Algorithm to find the coefficients `x` and `y` in the linear Diophantine equation `ax + by = gcd(a, b)`, but it does not account for cases where the GCD is not equal to 1.

Another issue is that the code checks if `n * m % k` is zero, but it does not verify if the calculated points actually form a triangle with the required area. The condition `if abs(n1 * m) >= g` checks if the calculated value of `n1 * m` is greater than or equal to the GCD `g`, but it does not guarantee that the triangle formed by the points will have the required area.

Moreover, the code uses `func_2(a, b)` to find the coefficients `x` and `y`, but it does not handle cases where `a` or `b` is negative, or where both are zero.

For example, if `n = 4`, `m = 3`, and `k = 4`, the code will output "NO", but it should be able to find three points that form a triangle with an area equal to $\frac{nm}{k} = 3$. 

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
