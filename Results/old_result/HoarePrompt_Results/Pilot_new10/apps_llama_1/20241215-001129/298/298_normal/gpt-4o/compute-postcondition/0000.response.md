The code `n, m, k = map(int, input().split())` is used to input three integer values from the user and assign them to the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` respectively. 

The `map(int, input().split())` expression splits the input into a list of strings (using space as the delimiter), converts each string to an integer using the `int()` function, and returns a map object. This map object is then unpacked into the variables `n`, `m`, and `k`.

Since the initial state specifies that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that `1 <= n, m <= 10^9` and `2 <= k <= 10^9`, the new values of `n`, `m`, and `k` will also be integers. However, the ranges of these values will depend on the user's input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, where `n` and `m` can be any integer and `k` can be any integer, but user input may have any value. Note that n, m, and k are assigned values based on the user's input.**
