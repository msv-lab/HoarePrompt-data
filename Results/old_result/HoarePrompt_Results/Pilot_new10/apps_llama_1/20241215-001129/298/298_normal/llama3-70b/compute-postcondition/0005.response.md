The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, where both `a` and `b` are integers and are non-zero. The function returns values based on two cases: 
Case_1: If the conditions for this case are met, the function returns two values: 1 and 0, representing components of a solution to the linear Diophantine equation.
Case_2: If the conditions for this case are met, the function returns two calculated values: `y` and `x - a // b * y`, where `x` and `y` are determined by recursive calls to `func_2` with modified parameters `b` and `a % b`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integer coefficients `a` and `b` of a linear Diophantine equation, and return solution components based on specific conditions.
Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters a and b, returns either (1,0) or the calculated values y and x - a // b * y based on the conditions of the linear Diophantine equation.**
