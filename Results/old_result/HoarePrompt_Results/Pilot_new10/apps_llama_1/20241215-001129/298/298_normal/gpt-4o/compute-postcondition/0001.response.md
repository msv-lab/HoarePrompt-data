The code calculates the `area` by multiplying `n` and `m` and then dividing the result by `k`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers. 

The value of `area` is `n * m / k`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n * m / k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is `n * m / k`**
