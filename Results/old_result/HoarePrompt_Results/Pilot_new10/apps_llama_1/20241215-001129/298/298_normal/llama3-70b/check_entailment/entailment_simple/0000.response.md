Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. Here's why:

1. The problem asks to find three integer points $(x_1, y_1)$, $(x_2, y_2)$, $(x_3, y_3)$ such that $0 \le x_1, x_2, x_3 \le n$, $0 \le y_1, y_2, y_3 \le m$ and the area of the triangle formed by these points is equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$. However, the program only generates points $(0, 0)$, $(0, n1 * m // g)$, and $(m1 * m // g, 0)$, which may not always form a triangle with the required area.

2. The program does not handle cases where $n * m$ is not divisible by $k$. While it checks for this condition and prints 'NO' in such cases, it does not provide any further explanation or attempt to find alternative solutions.

3. The use of `func_3` and `func_2` seems to be related to solving a linear Diophantine equation, but its connection to the problem of finding points for a triangle with a given area is not clear. The program does not provide any explanation or justification for using these functions.

4. The program does not consider all possible combinations of points that could form a triangle with the required area. It only generates points based on the GCD of $n$ and $m$, which may not be sufficient to find a solution in all cases.

To fix these issues, the program should be modified to:

* Correctly generate points that form a triangle with the required area
* Handle cases where $n * m$ is not divisible by $k$
* Provide a clear explanation for the use of `func_3` and `func_2`
* Consider all possible combinations of points that could form a triangle with the required area

Here is a simple example where the program fails:

Input: `3 4 4`

The program should output points that form a triangle with an area of `3 * 4 / 4 = 3`, but it fails to do so.

A correct approach to solve this problem would be to use a different method, such as checking all possible combinations of points and calculating the area of the triangle formed by each combination. However, this would require a significant modification to the program. 

Here is an example of a modified version of the program:

```python
import math

def calculate_area(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3):
    return abs((x1 * (y2 - y3) + x2 * (y3 - y1) + x3 * (y1 - y2)) / 2.0)

def find_points(n, m, k):
    target_area = n * m / k
    for x1 in range(n + 1):
        for y1 in range(m + 1):
            for x2 in range(n + 1):
                for y2 in range(m + 1):
                    for x3 in range(n + 1):
                        for y3 in range(m + 1):
                            area = calculate_area(x1, y1, x2, y2, x3, y3)
                            if math.isclose(area, target_area, rel_tol=1e-5):
                                return (x1, y1), (x2, y2), (x3, y3)
    return None

(n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n * m % k!= 0:
    print('NO')
else:
    points = find_points(n, m, k)
    if points:
        print('YES')
        for point in points:
            print(point[0], point[1])
    else:
        print('NO')
```

This modified version of the program checks all possible combinations of points and calculates the area of the triangle formed by each combination. If it finds a combination that forms a triangle with the required area, it prints the points. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. However, this program may not be efficient for large inputs due to its brute-force approach.
