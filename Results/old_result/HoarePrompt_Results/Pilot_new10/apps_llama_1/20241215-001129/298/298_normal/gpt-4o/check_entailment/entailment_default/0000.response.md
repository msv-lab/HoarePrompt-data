Correctness: **False**

The provided code attempts to find three integer points that form a triangle with an area equal to $\frac{nm}{k}$, but it does not cover all possible cases.

One such case where the code fails is when $n = m = k = 2$. In this case, the area of the triangle should be $\frac{nm}{k} = 2$, but the code calculates $2 * area = 4$, which is larger than both $n$ and $m$. Therefore, it prints `f'{n} {m // 2}'` and `f'0 {m // 2}'`, which are `(2, 1)` and `(0, 1)`. However, these points do not form a triangle with an area of $2$.

Another issue with the code is that it does not consider all possible configurations of points. For example, it only checks if $2 * area$ is less than or equal to $n$ or $m$, but it does not consider cases where $2 * area$ is larger than both $n$ and $m$ but still possible to form a triangle with the desired area.

The code also does not handle cases where $n$ or $m$ is $0$. In such cases, the area of the triangle should be $0$, but the code prints 'NO' instead of finding points that form a triangle with an area of $0$.

Overall, the code does not cover all possible cases and does not always find the correct points to form a triangle with the desired area. Therefore, its correctness is **False**.
