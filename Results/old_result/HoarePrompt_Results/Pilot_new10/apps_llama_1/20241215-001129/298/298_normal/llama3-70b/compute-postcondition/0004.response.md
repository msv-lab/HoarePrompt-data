To determine the output state, we need to understand the given initial state and the Python code snippet. The initial state provides information about the variables `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y`, where `a` is an integer, `b` is a non-zero integer, and `x` and `y` are assigned based on the function `func_2(b, a % b)`.

Given the return statement `return y, x - a // b * y`, we are returning two values: `y` and the result of the expression `x - a // b * y`. 

Since `x` and `y` are assigned based on `func_2(b, a % b)`, without the specific definition of `func_2`, we can only describe the nature of `x` and `y` as being dependent on the result of this function, which takes the remainder of `a` divided by `b` as one of its arguments.

The expression `x - a // b * y` involves:
- `x`: a value assigned based on `func_2(b, a % b)`
- `a // b`: the integer division of `a` by `b`, which will be an integer because `//` in Python performs floor division, returning the largest possible integer.
- `y`: a value assigned based on `func_2(b, a % b)`

Thus, `x - a // b * y` will be a value that results from subtracting the product of the integer division of `a` by `b` and `y` from `x`. This means it's a calculation that adjusts `x` based on the quotient of `a` divided by `b` (ignoring any remainder) scaled by `y`.

Given the provided information, the program returns `y`, which is a value determined by `func_2(b, a % b)`, and the calculated value of `x - a // b * y`, which depends on `x`, `y`, `a`, and `b`.

Output State: **The program returns `y`, which is assigned based on `func_2(b, a % b)`, and the value of `x - a // b * y`, where `x` is also assigned based on `func_2(b, a % b)`, `a` is an integer, and `b` is a non-zero integer.**
