The code snippet prints the string '1 0'. The values of the variables `n`, `m`, `k`, and `area` are not affected by this code. The states of the printed outputs are updated to include the new printed string '1 0' in addition to the previously printed strings 'YES', '0 0', and '1 ' followed by the value of `2 * area`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `area` is an integer equal to `n * m / k`, 'YES' has been printed, '0 0' has been printed, '1 ` followed by the value of `2 * area` has been printed, '1 0' has been printed, where `2 * area` is larger than `n` and less than or equal to `m`.**
