Correctness: **False**

The given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. A counterexample is when the input is `4 3 6`. The program will check if `n * m % k` equals zero, which it does in this case, but then it does not correctly calculate the points for the triangle.

In this case, the area of the triangle should be equal to `nm/k = 2`. However, the program does not correctly calculate the points for the triangle.

Another issue with the program is that it only checks if `abs(n1 * m) >= g`, but it does not consider the case where `g` does not divide `n1 * m`. In such cases, the program will not be able to find the correct points for the triangle.

The function `func_3(n, m)` is also not correctly defined in the given code, the definition of this function seems to calculate the gcd of `n` and `m` but it is not clear how this is used to find the points of the triangle. 

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all possible cases and correctly calculate the points for the triangle based on the given conditions. 

In general, the program seems to be incomplete and does not handle all possible cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
