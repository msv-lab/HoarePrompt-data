The input consists of an even number of integers (n), followed by n integers representing the numbers written on the cards, such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 100 for all i. 
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is an even number between 2 and 100 (inclusive), because this range is specified in the problem.
Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive)**
