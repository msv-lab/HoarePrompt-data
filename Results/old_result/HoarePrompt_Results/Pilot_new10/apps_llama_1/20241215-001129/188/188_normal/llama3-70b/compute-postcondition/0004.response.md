According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing one integer element which is an input integer, `i` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The loop will execute again as long as `n` is greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing one integer element which is an input integer, `i` is 1**
