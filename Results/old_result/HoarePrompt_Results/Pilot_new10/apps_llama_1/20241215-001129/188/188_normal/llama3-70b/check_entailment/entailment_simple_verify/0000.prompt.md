You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Petya and Vasya decided to play a game. They have n cards (n is an even number). A single integer is written on each card.

Before the game Petya will choose an integer and after that Vasya will choose another integer (different from the number that Petya chose). During the game each player takes all the cards with number he chose. For example, if Petya chose number 5 before the game he will take all cards on which 5 is written and if Vasya chose number 10 before the game he will take all cards on which 10 is written.

The game is considered fair if Petya and Vasya can take all n cards, and the number of cards each player gets is the same.

Determine whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) — number of cards. It is guaranteed that n is an even number.

The following n lines contain a sequence of integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (one integer per line, 1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — numbers written on the n cards.


-----Output-----

If it is impossible for Petya and Vasya to choose numbers in such a way that the game will be fair, print "NO" (without quotes) in the first line. In this case you should not print anything more.

In the other case print "YES" (without quotes) in the first line. In the second line print two distinct integers — number that Petya should choose and the number that Vasya should choose to make the game fair. If there are several solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the game will be fair if, for example, Petya chooses number 11, and Vasya chooses number 27. Then the will take all cards — Petya will take cards 1 and 4, and Vasya will take cards 2 and 3. Thus, each of them will take exactly two cards.

In the second example fair game is impossible because the numbers written on the cards are equal, but the numbers that Petya and Vasya should choose should be distinct.

In the third example it is impossible to take all cards. Petya and Vasya can take at most five cards — for example, Petya can choose number 10 and Vasya can choose number 20. But for the game to be fair it is necessary to take 6 cards.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
    c = 0
    (a1, a2) = (-1, -1)
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
    if a1 != -1 and a2 != -1:
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines whether Petya and Vasya can choose integer numbers before the game so that the game is fair. 

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It first reads the number of cards `n` and the numbers on each card `a`.
2. It then creates a dictionary `d` to store the frequency of each number on the cards.
3. The program then iterates through the dictionary `d` to find numbers that appear exactly `n // 2` times.
4. If it finds two such numbers, it prints 'YES' and the two numbers. If not, it prints 'NO'.

The program's logic is sound and it handles all possible cases correctly. For example:

- If there are two numbers that appear exactly `n // 2` times, the program correctly prints 'YES' and the two numbers.
- If there is only one number that appears `n` times, the program correctly prints 'NO' because Petya and Vasya need to choose distinct numbers.
- If there are no numbers that appear exactly `n // 2` times, the program correctly prints 'NO'.

The program's use of a dictionary to store the frequency of each number is efficient, and its logic is easy to follow. Overall, the program is correct and works as expected.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function operates on a predefined set of input where the first input is an even integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) representing the number of cards, and the subsequent n inputs are integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) representing the numbers written on the cards.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = []
    for i in range(n):
        a.append(int(input()))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements where each element is an input integer, `i` is `n-1`.
    d = {}
    for i in a:
        if i in d:
            d[i] += 1
        else:
            d[i] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.
    #
    #1. **Initial State**: 
    #   - `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
    #   - `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements.
    #   - `i` is `n-1`.
    #   - `d` is an empty dictionary.
    #
    #2. **Loop Code**:
    #   ```
    #   for i in a:
    #       if i in d:
    #           d[i] += 1
    #       else:
    #           d[i] = 1
    #   ```
    #   This loop iterates over each element `i` in list `a`. For each `i`, it checks if `i` is already a key in dictionary `d`. If `i` is in `d`, it increments the value associated with `i` by 1. If `i` is not in `d`, it adds `i` as a new key with a value of 1.
    #
    #3. **Output States after Few Iterations**:
    #   - After 1 iteration, `i` is the first element in `a`, and `d` contains this element as a key with a value indicating its frequency.
    #   - After 2 iterations, `i` equals the second element in `a`, and `d` contains at least the first two elements of `a` as keys.
    #   - After 3 iterations, `i` equals the third element in `a`, and `d` contains at least the first three elements of `a` as keys, with their respective frequencies updated.
    #
    #4. **Analyzing the Pattern**:
    #   - The loop will iterate `n` times because it iterates over each element in list `a`, which contains `n` elements.
    #   - After all iterations, `i` will be the last element in `a` because the loop iterates over `a` in order.
    #   - Dictionary `d` will contain each unique element from `a` as a key, with its corresponding value being the frequency of that element in `a`.
    #
    #5. **Final Output State**:
    #   - The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the number of elements in `a`.
    #   - `i` will be the last element in `a`.
    #   - `d` will be a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `a`, and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`.
    #   - Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `a` contains `n` integer elements, the final state of `n` and `a` does not change; `n` remains an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `a` remains a list containing `n` integer elements.
    #
    #**Output State: ** `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `i` is the last element in `a`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`.
    c = 0
    a1, a2 = -1, -1
    for i in d:
        if d[i] == n // 2:
            if c == 0:
                a1 = i
                c += 1
            else:
                a2 = i
                break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `i` is the last key in `d`, `c` is 0 or 1, `a1` is the first element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2` or -1, and `a2` is the second element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2` or -1.
    if (a1 != -1 and a2 != -1) :
        print('YES')
        print(a1, a2)
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `i` is the last key in `d`, `c` is 0 or 1, if there are at least two elements in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2`, then `a1` and `a2` are the first and second elements in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2`, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and `a1` and `a2` have been printed to the console. Otherwise, `a1` is the first element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2` or -1, `a2` is the second element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2` or -1, and 'NO' has been printed to the console, indicating that either `a1` is -1 or `a2` is -1, or both are -1.
