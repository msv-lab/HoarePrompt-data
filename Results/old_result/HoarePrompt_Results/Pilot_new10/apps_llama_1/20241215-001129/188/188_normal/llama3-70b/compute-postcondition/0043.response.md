Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements and has at least 1 unique element, `d` is a dictionary with at least 2 keys where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `i` is the second key in `d`. If `d[i]` equals `n // 2`, then if `c` equals 0, `c` is 2, `a1` equals `i`, and `a2` is -1. If `c` is not equal to 0, `c` is one more than its initial value, `a1` equals `i`, and if `d[first key]` equals half of `n`, `a2` equals the first key in `d`, otherwise `a2` remains unchanged. If `d[i]` does not equal `n // 2`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, except if `c` is not equal to 0, then `c` is one more than its initial value, `a1` equals `i`, and `a2` is `i` if `d[first key]` does not equal half of `n`.***
