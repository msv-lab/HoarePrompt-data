Postcondition: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `cards` is a list of `n` input integers, `count` is a dictionary where keys are the unique integers from `cards` and values are their respective counts, `unique_numbers` is a list of unique integers from `cards` sorted by their counts. The current value of `unique_numbers` has less than 2 unique integers, meaning it can either be empty or contain a single unique integer from `cards`.**
