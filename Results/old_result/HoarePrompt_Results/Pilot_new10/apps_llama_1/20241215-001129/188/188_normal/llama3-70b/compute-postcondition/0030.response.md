The code assigns the value of `i` to `a1`. The value of `i` is the first key in `d`, and the frequency of `i` in `a` is exactly half of the total number of elements in `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements and has at least 1 unique element, `d` is a dictionary with at least 1 key where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `c` is 0, `a1` is the first key in `d`, `a2` is -1, `i` is the first key in `d`**
