Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements and has at least 1 unique element, `d` is a dictionary with at least 1 key where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `i` is the first key in `d`. If `d[i]` equals half of `n`, then if `c` was initially 0, `c` is 1, `a1` is the first key in `d`, and `a2` is -1. If `c` was not initially 0, then `c` is not equal to 0, `a1` is -1, `a2` equals the first key in `d`. If `d[i]` does not equal half of `n`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
