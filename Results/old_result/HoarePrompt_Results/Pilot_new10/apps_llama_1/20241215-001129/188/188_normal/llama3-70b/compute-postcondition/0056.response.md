To determine the output state, we analyze the provided code snippet `print('NO')` under the given initial conditions.

1. **Initial Condition Analysis**:
   - `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements.
   - `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`.
   - `i` is the last key in `d`.
   - `c` is 0 or 1.
   - `a1` is the first element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2` or -1.
   - `a2` is the second element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2` or -1.
   - Either `a1` is -1 or `a2` is -1, or both are -1.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code snippet `print('NO')` simply prints the string 'NO' to the console. This operation does not modify any of the variables in the initial state.

3. **Output State Determination**:
   - Since `print('NO')` does not alter the values of any variables, all variables retain their initial states.
   - The print statement is an output operation and does not change the state of the variables in the program. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the addition of the print operation result (which, in this context, is the string 'NO' printed to the console).

Given these considerations, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`, `i` is the last key in `d`, `c` is 0 or 1, `a1` is the first element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2` or -1, `a2` is the second element in `a` with a frequency of `n // 2` or -1, and 'NO' has been printed to the console. Either `a1` is -1 or `a2` is -1, or both are -1.**
