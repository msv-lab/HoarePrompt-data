The code `d[i] += 1` increments the value associated with the key `i` in the dictionary `d` by 1. 

Given that `i` equals `a[2]`, the value of `d[i]` is incremented by 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `n` remains an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive). 

The list `a` still contains `n` integer elements. 

The dictionary `d` still contains at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` as keys, and the value associated with the key `a[2]` (which is `i`) is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `i` equals `a[2]`, `d` is a dictionary containing at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` as keys, and `d[a[2]]` is incremented by 1**
