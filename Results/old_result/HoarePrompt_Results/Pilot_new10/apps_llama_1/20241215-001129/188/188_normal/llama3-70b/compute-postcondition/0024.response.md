To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop code step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements.
   - `i` is `n-1`.
   - `d` is an empty dictionary.

2. **Loop Code**:
   ```
   for i in a:
       if i in d:
           d[i] += 1
       else:
           d[i] = 1
   ```
   This loop iterates over each element `i` in list `a`. For each `i`, it checks if `i` is already a key in dictionary `d`. If `i` is in `d`, it increments the value associated with `i` by 1. If `i` is not in `d`, it adds `i` as a new key with a value of 1.

3. **Output States after Few Iterations**:
   - After 1 iteration, `i` is the first element in `a`, and `d` contains this element as a key with a value indicating its frequency.
   - After 2 iterations, `i` equals the second element in `a`, and `d` contains at least the first two elements of `a` as keys.
   - After 3 iterations, `i` equals the third element in `a`, and `d` contains at least the first three elements of `a` as keys, with their respective frequencies updated.

4. **Analyzing the Pattern**:
   - The loop will iterate `n` times because it iterates over each element in list `a`, which contains `n` elements.
   - After all iterations, `i` will be the last element in `a` because the loop iterates over `a` in order.
   - Dictionary `d` will contain each unique element from `a` as a key, with its corresponding value being the frequency of that element in `a`.

5. **Final Output State**:
   - The loop will execute `n` times, where `n` is the number of elements in `a`.
   - `i` will be the last element in `a`.
   - `d` will be a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `a`, and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`.
   - Since `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `a` contains `n` integer elements, the final state of `n` and `a` does not change; `n` remains an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and `a` remains a list containing `n` integer elements.

**Output State: ** `n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `i` is the last element in `a`, and `d` is a dictionary where each key is a unique element from `a` and its value is the frequency of that element in `a`.
