Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly in every case. The issue lies in the logic of the program. It only checks if the counts of the two most frequent numbers are equal to half the total count. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee a fair game.

For example, if there are more than two numbers with the count equal to half the total count, the program will only consider the two most frequent numbers and ignore the others. 

Another issue is that the program does not consider the case where there are two numbers with counts equal to half the total count, but these numbers are not the two most frequent numbers. 

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
6
1
1
2
2
1
1
```

In this case, the counts of the numbers are {1: 4, 2: 2}. The program will output 'NO' because it only checks the counts of the two most frequent numbers. However, a fair game is possible if Petya chooses the number 1 and Vasya chooses any other number that appears three times, but since there is no such number, the game can't be fair. The program is actually correct in this case, but it is just a matter of time until we find a case where the logic fails. 

A case where the program fails is when there are two numbers with the same maximum frequency, for example:

Input:
```
6
1
1
2
2
3
3
```

In this case, the counts of the numbers are {1: 2, 2: 2, 3: 2}. The program will output 'NO' because it only checks if the count of the most frequent number is equal to half the total count. However, a fair game is possible if Petya chooses the number 1 and Vasya chooses the number 2, or Petya chooses the number 1 and Vasya chooses the number 3, or Petya chooses the number 2 and Vasya chooses the number 3, or Petya chooses the number 2 and Vasya chooses the number 1, or Petya chooses the number 3 and Vasya chooses the number 1, or Petya chooses the number 3 and Vasya chooses the number 2. 

The program should be modified to check all possible pairs of numbers with counts equal to half the total count. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
from collections import Counter

def func():
    n = int(input())
    cards = [int(input()) for _ in range(n)]
    count = Counter(cards)
    for num1 in count:
        for num2 in count:
            if num1!= num2 and count[num1] == n // 2 and count[num2] == n // 2 and sum(count[x] for x in count if x not in [num1, num2]) == 0:
                print('YES')
                print(num1, num2)
                return
    print('NO')
```
