The code `a.append(int(input()))` appends an integer input to the list `a`. Initially, `a` contains two integer elements. After the code execution, `a` will contain three integer elements: the first two elements are the initial input integers, and the third element is the newly input integer.

The value of `n` remains an even integer between 4 and 100 (inclusive), and the value of `i` remains 2. 

Output State: **`n` is an even integer between 4 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing three integer elements where the first two elements are input integers and the third element is an input integer, `i` is 2**
