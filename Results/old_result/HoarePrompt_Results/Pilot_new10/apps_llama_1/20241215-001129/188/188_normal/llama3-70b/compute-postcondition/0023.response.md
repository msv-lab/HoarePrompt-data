Postcondition: ***`n` is an even integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list containing `n` integer elements, `i` equals `a[2]`, `d` is a dictionary containing at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]` as keys. If `i` is in `d`, then `d[a[2]]` is incremented by 1. If `i` is not in `d`, then `d[a[2]]` equals 1.***
