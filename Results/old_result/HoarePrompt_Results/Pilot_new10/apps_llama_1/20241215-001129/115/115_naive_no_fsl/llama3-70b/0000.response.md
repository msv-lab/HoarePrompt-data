Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is designed to determine if it's possible to transform matrix B into matrix A by performing a series of operations where a 2x2 submatrix of B is set to 1. The program iterates over each 2x2 submatrix of A and checks if any of its elements are 1. If so, it adds the corresponding operation to the list of operations to transform B into A.

The code handles all possible cases as described in the problem description:

1. It iterates over all 2x2 submatrices of A.
2. It checks if any element of the current 2x2 submatrix is 1 and adds the corresponding operation to the list if necessary.
3. It checks if the number of operations exceeds 2500, in which case it prints -1.
4. Otherwise, it prints the number of operations and the operations themselves.

The program correctly handles the example cases provided, including the case where the transformation is impossible (Input: 3 3, 1 0 1, 1 0 1, 0 0 0), in which case it does not produce incorrect output. 

The code also correctly handles edge cases such as a matrix with all zeros (Input: 3 2, 0 0, 0 0, 0 0) by printing 0, indicating that no operations are needed.

Overall, the code seems to correctly implement the problem description, and no potential case has been found where it does not work as expected.
