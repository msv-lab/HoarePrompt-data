Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. It only checks for the case where all four elements in a 2x2 submatrix are 1. If a 2x2 submatrix has only three elements that are 1, it does not perform the operation to fill in the rest of the submatrix.

For example, if the input matrix is:
```
1 1 1
1 1 1
0 1 0
```
The program will not perform any operation because it only checks for the case where all four elements in a 2x2 submatrix are 1. However, it is possible to make the matrix equal to the target matrix by performing the operation on the submatrix at position (1, 1) and then the submatrix at position (1, 2).

The program should be modified to handle cases where only three elements in a 2x2 submatrix are 1. This can be done by checking all possible 2x2 submatrices and performing the operation if any of the elements in the submatrix are 1.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where the input matrix has only two rows or two columns correctly. In such cases, the program may not be able to make the matrix equal to the target matrix by performing the operation on 2x2 submatrices. 

The program should be modified to handle these edge cases correctly.

Here is a possible modification to the program:

```python
if __name__ == '__main__':
    import sys
    input = sys.stdin.read
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    m = int(data[1])
    A = []
    index = 2
    for i in range(n):
        row = []
        for j in range(m):
            row.append(int(data[index]))
            index += 1
        A.append(row)
    operations = []
    B = [[0] * m for _ in range(n)]
    for i in range(n - 1):
        for j in range(m - 1):
            if A[i][j] == 1 or A[i][j + 1] == 1 or A[i + 1][j] == 1 or A[i + 1][j + 1] == 1:
                B[i][j] = B[i][j + 1] = B[i + 1][j] = B[i + 1][j + 1] = 1
                operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j]!= B[i][j]:
                print(-1)
                exit()
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])
```
This modified program checks all possible 2x2 submatrices and performs the operation if any of the elements in the submatrix are 1. It also handles the case where the input matrix has only two rows or two columns correctly.
