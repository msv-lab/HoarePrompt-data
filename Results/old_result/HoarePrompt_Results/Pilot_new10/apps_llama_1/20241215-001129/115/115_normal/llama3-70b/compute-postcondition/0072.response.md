Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`. If `ops` initially contains more than 2500 elements, then -1 has been printed. Otherwise, `ops` is an empty list and all operations in the original `ops` list have been printed.***
