To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given:
- `n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50 and both are greater than 1.
- `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns.
- If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.
- Since the program has not returned -1, it holds that `A[i]` is equal to `B[i]`.

The loop statement is `for j in range(m):`. This implies that the loop iterates over each column index `j` of the 2D lists `A` and `B`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- The loop has executed for a certain value of `j`, let's say `j = k`, where `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k < m.
- The state guarantees that for all `i` (rows), `A[i][k]` equals `B[i][k]`, because if they were not equal, the program would have returned -1.
- The fact that `A[i]` equals `B[i]` holds because the precondition guarantees this equality as long as the program has not returned -1.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The current value of `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `k + 1`.
- The loop condition `j in range(m)` must still be satisfied, meaning `k + 1` must be less than `m`.
- The condition on `m` must be adjusted such that `m` must be greater than `k + 1` to allow for at least one more iteration.

Therefore, considering the given loop statement and the end state of the previous iteration:
- `n` remains unchanged as it does not affect the loop condition directly.
- `m` must be greater than the next index to be processed, which is `k + 1`, but since we do not know the exact value of `k`, we can say `m` must be greater than the current `j` (which is the same as saying `m` must be greater than the last `j` value processed, implying `m` is at least the current `j` plus one).
- `A` and `B` remain 2D lists with `n` rows and `m` columns, with the understanding that each row `A[i]` equals `B[i]`, and specifically for the columns processed so far, `A[i][j]` equals `B[i][j]` for `j` up to the last processed index.
- The new index `j` for the next iteration will be the old `j` plus one.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50 and both are greater than 1, `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where each row `A[i]` equals `B[i]`, and `m` must be greater than the current `j` which is now incremented to the next column index**.
