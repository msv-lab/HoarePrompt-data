According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is greater than 0 and between 2 and 50. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1, and `m` must be greater than 1 for the loop to execute again.
State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `m` must be greater than 1, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list containing tuples, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and either all elements of `A` and `B` at index `i` are equal, or the program has returned -1. If the program has not returned -1, then `A[i]` is equal to `B[i]`. Additionally, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]`.**
