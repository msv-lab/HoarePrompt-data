The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since we are not provided with any loop in the given code, the `continue` statement will have no effect and will result in a syntax error if not inside a loop. However, assuming it is inside a loop, the values of the variables will not change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `ops` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
