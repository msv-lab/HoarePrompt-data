Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. 

The issue lies in the way the program constructs the matrix `B` and the operations list. The program only checks for 2x2 sub-matrices in `A` where all elements are 1, and if such a sub-matrix is found, it marks the corresponding elements in `B` as 1 and adds the operation to the list.

However, the program does not handle cases where a single element in `A` is 1, but it is not part of a 2x2 sub-matrix with all elements equal to 1. In such cases, the program will not mark the corresponding element in `B` as 1, and hence, `B` will not be equal to `A`.

For example, consider the input:

```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```

In this case, the program will not be able to transform `B` into `A` because the elements at positions (0, 0) and (0, 2) in `A` are 1, but they are not part of a 2x2 sub-matrix with all elements equal to 1.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to handle such cases. One possible approach is to iterate over the elements of `A` and check if an element is 1. If it is, the program should try to find a 2x2 sub-matrix that includes this element and has all elements equal to 1. If such a sub-matrix is found, the program should mark the corresponding elements in `B` as 1 and add the operation to the list. If no such sub-matrix is found, the program should return -1, indicating that it is not possible to transform `B` into `A`.

Here's an example of how the corrected code could look like:

```python
def func_1(n, m, A):
    operations = []
    B = [([0] * m) for _ in range(n)]
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j] == 1:
                found = False
                for x in range(max(0, i-1), min(n-1, i+1) + 1):
                    for y in range(max(0, j-1), min(m-1, j+1) + 1):
                        if x < n - 1 and y < m - 1 and A[x][y] == 1 and A[x][y + 1] == 1 and A[x + 1][y] == 1 and A[x + 1][y + 1] == 1:
                            B[x][y] = B[x][y + 1] = B[x + 1][y] = B[x + 1][y + 1] = 1
                            operations.append((x + 1, y + 1))
                            found = True
                            break
                    if found:
                        break
                if not found:
                    return -1
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if A[i][j]!= B[i][j]:
                return -1
        
    print(len(operations))
    for op in operations:
        print(op[0], op[1])
```

This corrected version of the code checks for each element in `A` if it is 1, and if so, tries to find a 2x2 sub-matrix that includes this element and has all elements equal to 1. If such a sub-matrix is found, the program marks the corresponding elements in `B` as 1 and adds the operation to the list. If no such sub-matrix is found, the program returns -1.
