To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the pattern observed from the output states after a few iterations.

The loop code checks every 2x2 sub-matrix in the `A` 2D list. If a sub-matrix contains at least one 1 but not all 1s, it appends a tuple to `ops` containing the row index plus one and the column index plus one of the top-left element of that sub-matrix.

From the output states provided:
- After the first iteration, `ops` contains tuples for each column index where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix has at least one 1 but not all 1s.
- After the second iteration, `ops` includes tuples for the second row as well, following the same condition.
- After the third iteration, it includes tuples for the third row.

The pattern suggests that `ops` will contain tuples for every row and column index where the 2x2 sub-matrix satisfies the condition of having at least one 1 but not all 1s.

The loop will execute for every row and column in `A`, given that `n` and `m` are within the specified ranges (2 to 50 inclusive), and `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m`. 

The output state after all iterations will have:
- `n` and `m` unchanged as they are integers between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `A` unchanged as it is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers.
- `ops` containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for every `i` and `j` where the 2x2 sub-matrix defined by `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` has at least one 1 but not all 1s.
- `i` will be `n - 1` after the loop finishes because it iterates over `range(n - 1)`.
- `j` will be `m - 1` after the loop finishes because it iterates over `range(m - 1)`.

If the loop does not execute, it means `n` or `m` is less than 2, which contradicts the initial conditions provided. Therefore, under the given initial conditions, the loop will always execute at least once.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, and `ops` contains tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for every position `(i, j)` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s.**
