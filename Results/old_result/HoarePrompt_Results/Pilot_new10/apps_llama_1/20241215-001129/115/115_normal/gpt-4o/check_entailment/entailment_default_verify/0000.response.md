The original assessment points out that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically when a 2x2 operation in B can be used to match elements in A but the program only checks for 2x2 submatrices completely filled with 1s in A and applies operations in B based on those. 

However, upon closer inspection of the problem description and the code, it becomes apparent that the code's strategy is indeed insufficient to cover all possible cases. The problem description does not limit the operations to only completely filled 2x2 submatrices in A, which means the code's approach can fail to find a correct sequence of operations or incorrectly determine that it's impossible to make B equal to A.

The provided output hints align with the code's functionality but do not change the fact that the code's strategy is limited. The hints indicate that the function should print -1 if A cannot be transformed into a matrix where all elements are set by 2x2 sub-matrix operations, but the code does not correctly implement this for all possible cases of A.

A key oversight in the code is its inability to handle scenarios where a single 1 in A cannot be part of a 2x2 submatrix filled with 1s. The code only checks for specific patterns and does not have the flexibility to explore all possible sequences of 2x2 operations that could make B equal to A.

Given this analysis, the original assessment that the program is not correct due to its limited approach and inability to handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description remains accurate.

Final: **False**
