The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the `operations` list. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 0, so the tuple `(1, 1)` is appended to the `operations` list. 

The states of `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, `i`, and `j` are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `A[i][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1, `operations` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
