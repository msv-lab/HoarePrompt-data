Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be greater than 1, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ops` contains tuples `(1, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s, plus tuples `(2, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix contains at least one 1 but not all 1s. The current value of `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, meaning the 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` starting from position `(i, j)` contains all 1s.**
