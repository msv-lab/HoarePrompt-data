The code appends a tuple `(i + 1, j + 1)` to the list `ops`. Given the initial state, `i` is 2 and `j` is 0. Therefore, `i + 1` equals 3 and `j + 1` equals 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is still 1. 

The `ops` list now contains the new tuple `(3, 1)` in addition to any tuples it may have contained before.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, at least one of `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, or `A[3][1]` is 1, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ops` contains tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A` and now also contains the tuple `(3, 1)`**
