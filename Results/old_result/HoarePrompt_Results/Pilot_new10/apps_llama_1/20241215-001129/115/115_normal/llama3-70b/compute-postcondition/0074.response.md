Based on the provided annotated code and return postconditions, the function `func` accepts two implicit parameters: the dimensions of matrix A (n, m) and the elements of matrix A. The function does not explicitly take any parameters, but it reads input from the user in the form of two integers n and m, followed by n lines of m integers, representing the elements of matrix A.

The function iterates over each 2x2 sub-matrix in matrix A and checks if the sub-matrix contains at least one 1 but not all 1s. If such a sub-matrix is found, the function adds the coordinates (i+1, j+1) of the top-left corner of the sub-matrix to the list `ops`. 

After checking all sub-matrices, if the length of `ops` exceeds 2500, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the length of `ops` followed by the coordinates of each operation in `ops`.

The functionality of the function does not explicitly involve matrix B, despite the annotation mentioning it. The function only operates on matrix A and performs operations based on its elements.

Considering potential edge cases, if the input matrix A is not provided in the correct format (i.e., not enough or too many rows or columns), the function may fail or produce incorrect results. Additionally, if the input matrix A contains values other than 0 or 1, the function's behavior is not well-defined.

Functionality: ** The function accepts the dimensions and elements of matrix A as input, identifies 2x2 sub-matrices with at least one 1 but not all 1s, and prints the number and coordinates of these sub-matrices, or -1 if there are more than 2500 such sub-matrices. **
