The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since there's no loop provided in the given code snippet, the effect of `continue` cannot be directly determined without additional context. However, based on the initial state provided and the nature of the `continue` statement, we can infer its impact.

Given that `continue` does not change the values of variables but rather controls the flow of the program by skipping to the next iteration of a loop, none of the variables (`n`, `m`, `A`, `i`, `j`, `ops`) have their values altered by this statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ops` contains tuples `(1, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s, and if at least one of the following is 1: `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]`, then `ops` also contains `(2, 1)`, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.**
