According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `m`. If `j` is less than `m - 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0, `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 1. The loop can execute again if `j` is less than `m - 1`, which means `m` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and `m` must be at least 3, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `ops` contains tuples `(1, k)` for each column index `k` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s, and if at least one of the following is 1: `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]`, then `ops` also contains `(2, 1)`**
