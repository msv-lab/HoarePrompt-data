Based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version of the code, I believe that the original assessment is not accurate.

The original assessment claims that the code does not correctly solve the problem because it adds an operation for each 2x2 submatrix that contains at least one 1, without considering whether the operation would also set other elements in A to 1. However, this criticism does not take into account the fact that the code only adds an operation for a submatrix if it does not contain all 1s. If a submatrix contains all 1s, the code skips it, which means that the operation would not set any additional elements to 1.

The annotated version of the code also suggests that the code is correct. It states that after the for loop has been executed, `ops` contains tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for every position `(i, j)` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s. This is exactly the correct condition for adding an operation to set the corresponding submatrix in B to 1.

Therefore, I believe that the original assessment is not accurate, and the code is actually correct.

Final: **True**
