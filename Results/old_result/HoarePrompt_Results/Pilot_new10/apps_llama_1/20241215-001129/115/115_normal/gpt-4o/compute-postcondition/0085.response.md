The given code prints the length of `operations`, but the initial state does not provide information about `operations`. However, we can still describe the output state based on the given information.


The values of `n`, `m`, `A`, `B`, `i`, and `j` are not affected by the code. The state of `operations` is unknown but its length is printed. 


The output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, either `A` is equal to `B` or there exists an `i` and `j` such that `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]` and the program has returned -1 (in this case `A` and `B`'s states are unchanged), `i` is `n` if the loop completes without returning -1, `j` equals `m` if the loop completes without returning -1 for any given `i`, and the length of `operations` is printed.


Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, either `A` is equal to `B` or there exists an `i` and `j` such that `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]` and the program has returned -1 (in this case `A` and `B`'s states are unchanged), `i` is `n` if the loop completes without returning -1, `j` equals `m` if the loop completes without returning -1 for any given `i`, and the length of `operations` is printed.**
