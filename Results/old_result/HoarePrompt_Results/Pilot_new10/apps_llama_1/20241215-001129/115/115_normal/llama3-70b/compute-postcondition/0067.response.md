According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `ops` list. If the list has at least two elements, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples and the first operation `ops[0]` has been printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `ops` must have at least two elements and the first operation `ops[0]` has been processed.
State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers and must have at least one 2x2 sub-matrix with at least one 1 but not all 1s, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for every position `(i, j)` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s, the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2499, and the first operation has been processed**
