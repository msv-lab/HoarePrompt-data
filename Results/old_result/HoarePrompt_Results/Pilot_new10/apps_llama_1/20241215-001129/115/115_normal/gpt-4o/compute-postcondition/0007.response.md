Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If `A[i][j]` equals 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` equals 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` equals 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` equals 1, then `B[i][j]`, `B[i][j + 1]`, `B[i + 1][j]`, and `B[i + 1][j + 1]` are 1 and `operations` contains the tuple `(1, 1)`. Otherwise, the state of `A`, `B`, `operations` remains unchanged.***
