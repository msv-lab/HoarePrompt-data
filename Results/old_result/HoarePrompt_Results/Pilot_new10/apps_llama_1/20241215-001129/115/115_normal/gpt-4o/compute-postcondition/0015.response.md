Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 3 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns. If `A[i][j]` is 1 and `A[i][j + 1]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j]` is 1 and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[0][3]`, `B[1][1]`, `B[1][2]`, and `B[1][3]` are 1 and `operations` is a list containing the tuples `(1, 2)` and `(1, 3)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. If the condition is not met, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `B[0][1]`, `B[0][2]`, `B[1][1]`, and `B[1][2]` being 1 and `operations` being a list containing the tuple `(1, 2)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 2***
