To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the provided output states after the loop executes some number of times.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(m):
        if A[i][j]!= B[i][j]:
            return -1
```
This loop checks if the elements of `A` and `B` are equal at each position `(i, j)`. If it finds any pair of elements that are not equal, it immediately returns `-1`.

From the output states provided, we can observe the following:

- If the loop completes without returning `-1`, it means that `A` and `B` are identical.
- If the loop returns `-1`, the state of `A` and `B` remains unchanged, indicating that there is at least one position where `A` and `B` differ.

Considering these points, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be deduced as follows:

- If the loop completes normally (without returning `-1`), it implies that `A` and `B` are identical, meaning every element `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]` for all `i` in the range of `n` and all `j` in the range of `m`.
- If the loop returns `-1`, the state of `A` and `B` remains the same as the initial state, but we know that there exists at least one pair `(i, j)` where `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`.

Given the initial state and the loop's behavior:
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50.
- `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50.
- `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns.
- `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns.
- `operations` is a list containing tuples, but its state is not modified by the loop.
- The loop either completes without finding any mismatches between `A` and `B`, or it returns `-1` as soon as it finds a mismatch.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished:
- Either `A` is identical to `B` (in which case the loop completes without returning `-1`), or the program has returned `-1` (indicating `A` and `B` are not identical).
- The final state of `i` would be `n` if the loop completes without returning `-1`, indicating that all rows have been checked.
- The final state of `j` would be `m` if the loop completes without returning `-1` for any given `i`, indicating that all columns have been checked for that row.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, either `A` is equal to `B` or the program has returned -1 (in which case `A` and `B`'s states are unchanged and there exists an `i` and `j` such that `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`), `i` is `n` if the loop completes without returning -1, `j` equals `m` if the loop completes without returning -1 for any given `i`.**
