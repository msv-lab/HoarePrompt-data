Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and must be at least 2, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers. If at least one of the following conditions is true: `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then `ops` is a list containing the tuple `(1, 1)`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. If all of the following conditions are true: `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, and `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, then the state of the variables remains unchanged except for the potential change caused by the condition itself; otherwise, when the condition is met but not all of the values are 1, the state of the variables remains unchanged. If none of the conditions `A[i][j]` is 1, `A[i + 1][j]` is 1, `A[i][j + 1]` is 1, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1 are true, then the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
