Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `ops` contains tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A`. The current value of `A[i][j]`, `A[i + 1][j]`, `A[i][j + 1]`, or `A[i + 1][j + 1]` is 1, meaning that at least one of these elements in the 2D list `A` is equal to 1.**
