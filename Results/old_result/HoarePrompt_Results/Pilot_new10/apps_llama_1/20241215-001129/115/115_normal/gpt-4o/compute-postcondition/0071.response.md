To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code checks each element of the `i-th` row in 2D lists `A` and `B` to see if they are equal. If it finds any pair of elements that are not equal, the program immediately returns -1.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:
- `n` and `m` remain within their initial constraints (2 <= n, m <= 50) and are greater than 1.
- `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns.
- `i` remains 1, indicating that the loop only checks the first row (since `i` is not updated within the loop).
- `j` iterates over the columns of the `i-th` row, starting from 0.
- If the program has not returned -1, then `A[i]` is equal to `B[i]`, meaning all elements in the `i-th` row of `A` and `B` are equal.

Given the loop code and the observed patterns, after all iterations of the loop have finished (or if the loop does not execute because `m` is 0 or less, which is not possible given `m` is between 2 and 50), we can infer the following:
- If the loop completes without returning -1, it means that all elements in the `i-th` row of `A` and `B` are equal. Since `i` is 1, this specifically refers to the second row (0-indexed).
- The loop's termination condition is based on the range of `m`, meaning it will attempt to check each column of the specified row in `A` and `B`.
- If at any point `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the program returns -1. This implies that for the loop to complete without returning -1, all pairs of elements at corresponding positions in the `i-th` row of `A` and `B` must be equal.

Considering the variables' states after the loop:
- `n` and `m` retain their original values since they are not modified within the loop.
- `A` and `B` retain their original values, as the loop only reads from them and does not modify them.
- `operations` is unrelated to the loop's operation and thus remains unchanged.
- `i` remains 1, as it is not modified within the loop.
- If the loop completes without returning -1, then `A[i]` is equal to `B[i]`, indicating that the `i-th` row in both lists is identical.

Therefore, the output state after the loop finishes executing (if it does not return -1) is that `A[1]` is equal to `B[1]`, considering `i` equals 1 and the loop checks for equality across all columns of the row at index `i`. 

However, if we are to describe the state in a way that encompasses all possible outcomes (including the case where the loop returns -1), we must acknowledge that:
- If the loop returns -1, the state of `A`, `B`, `n`, `m`, and `operations` does not change from their initial values. The value of `i` also does not change.
- The loop's execution depends on `m` being greater than 0, which is guaranteed by the initial conditions.

Thus, considering the constraints and the operation of the loop, the output state after all iterations (or the attempt to iterate, in case of early return) can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 50, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `operations` is a list containing tuples, `i` is 1, and either the program has returned -1 (in which case `A` and `B`'s states are unchanged), or `A[1]` is equal to `B[1]` (implying all elements in the second row of `A` and `B` are equal if the program does not return -1).**
