To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for op in ops:`, which means the loop will execute as long as there are operations (`op`) in the list `ops`. 

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers and must have at least one 2x2 sub-matrix with at least one 1 but not all 1s.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `j` is `m - 1`.
- `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples with the first operation processed, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2499.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be met:
1. `ops` must not be empty after the previous iteration, meaning there must be at least one more operation to process.
2. Since the first operation has been processed, the list `ops` will have one less operation for the next iteration.

Adjusted states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` remains an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), as the loop does not affect `n`.
- `m` remains an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), as the loop does not affect `m`.
- `A` remains a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers and must have at least one 2x2 sub-matrix with at least one 1 but not all 1s, as the loop's effect on `A` is not specified.
- `i` remains `n - 1`, as the loop does not update `i`.
- `j` remains `m - 1`, as the loop does not update `j`.
- `ops` must have at least one more operation, meaning its length must be at least 1 after the first operation has been processed, and it is still less than or equal to 2499.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers and must have at least one 2x2 sub-matrix with at least one 1 but not all 1s, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ops` is a list of tuples with at least one operation, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2499**
