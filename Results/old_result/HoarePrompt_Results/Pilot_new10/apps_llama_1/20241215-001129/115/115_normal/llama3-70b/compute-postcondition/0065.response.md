To determine the state adjustments needed for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop statement:

```python
for op in ops:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For this loop to execute, `ops` must be a collection (like a list or tuple) that is iterable, and it must contain at least one element for the loop body to execute at least once.

Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive).
- `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers.
- `i` is `n - 1`.
- `j` is `m - 1`.
- `ops` contains tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for every position `(i, j)` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s.
- The length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500.
- The length of `ops` is returned.

Adjustments needed for the loop to execute:

1. **`ops` Must Be Non-Empty**: For the loop to execute, `ops` must contain at least one tuple. Given that `ops` is constructed based on the conditions of 2x2 sub-matrices in `A`, we need to ensure that such conditions exist. Thus, `A` must have at least one 2x2 sub-matrix with at least one 1 but not all 1s.

2. **`i` and `j` in Valid Range**: Although `i` and `j` are already defined as `n - 1` and `m - 1` respectively, and given that `n` and `m` are between 2 and 50 inclusive, it's implied that `i` and `j` are within valid ranges to potentially index into `A`.

3. **`A` Must Have Specific Pattern**: The construction of `ops` depends on the pattern of 1s in the 2x2 sub-matrices of `A`. For `ops` to be non-empty, `A` must have at least one 2x2 sub-matrix that meets the condition of having at least one 1 but not all 1s.

Considering these points, the adjusted state that allows the loop to execute would ensure that `ops` is non-empty, implying that `A` has the necessary pattern, and all other conditions are as initially stated.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive), `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers and must have at least one 2x2 sub-matrix with at least one 1 but not all 1s, `i` is `n - 1`, `j` is `m - 1`, `ops` is a non-empty list of tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for every position `(i, j)` where the corresponding 2x2 sub-matrix in `A` has at least one 1 but not all 1s, and the length of `ops` is less than or equal to 2500**
