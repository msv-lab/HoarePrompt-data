To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(m - 1):`, which means the loop will iterate over the range from 0 to `m - 2` (since the upper bound in `range()` is exclusive).

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive).
- `m` is an integer between 2 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1.
- `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is 0.
- The conditions related to `ops` and the 2x2 sub-matrices in `A` are as described, but they do not directly affect the loop iteration condition, which depends solely on `j` and `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `m - 1`. Since `j` is currently 0, it needs to be incremented by 1 to continue the loop, making `j` equal to 1. The condition `j < m - 1` must still hold true, which means `m` must be at least 3 for `j` to be 1 and the loop to continue.

State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive), `m` is an integer between 3 and 50 (inclusive) and greater than 1, `A` is a 2D list of size `n x m` containing integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 1, if at least one of `A[2][0]`, `A[3][0]`, `A[2][1]`, or `A[3][1]` is 1, then `ops` contains tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A` and also contains the tuple `(3, 1)`. Otherwise, `ops` contains tuples based on conditions related to 2x2 sub-matrices in `A` and no changes were made to `A`, `i`, `j`, or `ops`.**
