The code `operations.append((i + 1, j + 1))` appends a new tuple to the `operations` list. The tuple contains the values `i + 1` and `j + 1`. Given that `i` is 2 and `j` is 0, the tuple `(2 + 1, 0 + 1)` which is `(3, 1)` is appended to the `operations` list.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][j]`, `B[0][j+1]`, `B[1][j]`, and `B[1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[0][j]` equals 1 and `A[0][j+1]` equals 1 and `A[1][j]` equals 1 and `A[1][j+1]` equals 1, and for `i` = 1, `B[i][j]` equals 1, `B[i][j+1]` equals 1, `B[i+1][j]` equals 1, and `B[i+1][j+1]` equals 1, `operations` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each such `j`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `B[2][0]` equals 1, `B[2][1]` equals 1, `B[3][0]` equals 1, and `B[3][1]` equals 1, and `operations` now also includes the tuple `(3, 1)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns where `B[0][j]`, `B[0][j+1]`, `B[1][j]`, and `B[1][j+1]` are 1 for all `j` where `A[0][j]` equals 1 and `A[0][j+1]` equals 1 and `A[1][j]` equals 1 and `A[1][j+1]` equals 1, and for `i` = 1, `B[i][j]` equals 1, `B[i][j+1]` equals 1, `B[i+1][j]` equals 1, and `B[i+1][j+1]` equals 1, `operations` is a list containing tuples `(i + 1, j + 1)` for each such `j` and also includes `(3, 1)`, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `B[2][0]` equals 1, `B[2][1]` equals 1, `B[3][0]` equals 1, and `B[3][1]` equals 1**
