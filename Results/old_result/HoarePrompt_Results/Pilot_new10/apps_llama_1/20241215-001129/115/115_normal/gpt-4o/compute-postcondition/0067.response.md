Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are integers such that 2 <= n, m <= 50 and both are greater than 1, `A` and `B` are 2D lists of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns. If `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, `A[i][j]` is equal to `B[i][j]` and since the precondition also guarantees that if the program has not returned -1, then `A[i]` is equal to `B[i]`, it holds that `A[i]` remains equal to `B[i]`.***
