To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the given loop code and the provided output states after the loop executes some number of times.

Given loop code:
```python
for j in range(m):
    if A[i][j]!= B[i][j]:
        return -1
```

Key observations:
1. **Loop Termination Condition**: The loop iterates over each column index `j` in the range from 0 to `m-1`, where `m` is the number of columns in the 2D lists `A` and `B`.
2. **Conditional Return**: Inside the loop, the program checks if the elements at the current row `i` and column `j` are equal in both lists `A` and `B`. If they are not equal (`A[i][j]!= B[i][j]`), the program immediately returns `-1`, indicating that the lists `A` and `B` do not match at the specified position.
3. **No Modification of Lists**: The loop does not modify the lists `A` and `B`. It only checks for equality at specific positions.
4. **Iteration Dependency**: The loop's execution and the comparison at each step depend on the previous steps not having returned `-1`. This means that if `A[i][j]` equals `B[i][j]` for all `j` in the range, the loop completes without returning `-1`.

Given the output states after the loop executes some number of times and considering the loop's behavior:
- **Successful Completion**: If the loop completes without returning `-1`, it means that for the given row `i`, all elements in `A` and `B` are equal across all columns `j`.
- **Premature Termination**: If the loop returns `-1`, it does so as soon as it finds a mismatch between `A[i][j]` and `B[i][j]` for any `j`. In this case, the state of `A` and `B` remains unchanged, as the loop does not modify these lists.

Considering these points, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished can be deduced as follows:
- If the loop completes normally (without returning `-1`), it implies that for the specified row `i`, `A` and `B` have equal elements across all columns `j` from 0 to `m-1`.
- If the loop returns `-1`, the state of `A` and `B` remains the same as the initial state, but we know that there exists at least one `j` where `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`.

**Output State**: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 50, `m` is an integer such that 2 <= m <= 50, `A` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, `B` is a 2D list of integers with `n` rows and `m` columns, either `A[i]` is equal to `B[i]` (if the loop completes without returning -1), or the program has returned -1 (in which case `A` and `B`'s states are unchanged and there exists a `j` such that `A[i][j]` is not equal to `B[i][j]`), `i` is 2, `j` equals `m` if the loop completes without returning -1.**
