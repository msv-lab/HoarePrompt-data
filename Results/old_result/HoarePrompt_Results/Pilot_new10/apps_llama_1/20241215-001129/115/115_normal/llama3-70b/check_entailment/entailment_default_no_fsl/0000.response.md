Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly solve the problem for every potential case. The code identifies 2x2 sub-matrices with at least one 1 but not all 1s and prints the number and coordinates of these sub-matrices. However, it does not check if the remaining cells can be filled in to match matrix A.

For example, consider the input:
```
3 3
1 0 1
1 0 1
0 0 0
```
The code will output -1, which is correct. However, the code does not correctly handle cases where a 2x2 sub-matrix has only one 1. In such cases, the code will add the sub-matrix to the operations list, but it does not ensure that the remaining cells can be filled in to match matrix A.

A correct solution would need to verify that the operations can be performed in a way that fills in the remaining cells in matrix B to match matrix A. The code provided does not perform this verification, and therefore, it does not work correctly for every potential case.

To fix this issue, the code should be modified to check if a 2x2 sub-matrix can be filled in with 1s in a way that matches matrix A. If not, the code should not add the sub-matrix to the operations list. This can be achieved by checking the values of the adjacent cells in matrix A. If the adjacent cells do not match the pattern that can be filled in by the 2x2 sub-matrix operation, the code should not add the sub-matrix to the operations list. 

In the given example, the code will output -1, which is correct, but for other examples, it may not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the code is False.
