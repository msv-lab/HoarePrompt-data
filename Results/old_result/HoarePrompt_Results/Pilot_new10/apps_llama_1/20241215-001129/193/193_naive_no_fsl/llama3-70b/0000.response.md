Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic to find the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length `x` into an equilateral triangle of side length `y`. 

The issue lies in the fact that the program simply calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` and prints it. However, this approach does not take into account the fact that in each step, Memory can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle (triangle of positive area).

For example, when `x = 6` and `y = 3`, the program will print `3`, which is incorrect. The correct sequence of transformations as mentioned in the problem description is: `(6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3)`, which requires 4 steps, not 3.

Therefore, the program is incorrect, and the correct solution would require a more complex approach that takes into account the constraints of the problem.
