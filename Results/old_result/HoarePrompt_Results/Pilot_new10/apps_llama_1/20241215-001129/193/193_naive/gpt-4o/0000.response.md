Correctness: **True**.

The given Python program calculates the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length x into an equilateral triangle of side length y. The program assumes that the sides of the triangle can be modified in integer lengths, and the triangle should remain non-degenerate at all times.

The formula used in the program, `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, is based on the fact that the number of operations required to transform the triangle is directly related to the difference in their side lengths. 

If the difference is even, we can divide it by 2 to get the number of operations, because we can change two sides in each operation. However, if the difference is odd, we need to perform one more operation to account for the remaining side length difference.

We can prove the correctness of this formula by analyzing the possible operations:

1. If `x - y` is even, we can perform `(x - y) // 2` operations, each time decreasing two sides of the triangle by 1, until we reach the desired side length y.
2. If `x - y` is odd, we need to perform `(x - y) // 2` operations as described above, and then one more operation to decrease the last side by 1.

The provided examples confirm the correctness of the formula, and no counterexamples can be found within the given constraints (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000). 

Therefore, we can conclude that the program works correctly for all possible inputs, and hence, the correctness of the program is **True**.
