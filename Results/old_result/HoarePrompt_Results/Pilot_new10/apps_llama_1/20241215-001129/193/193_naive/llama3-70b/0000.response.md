Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it only calculates the absolute difference between the starting and ending side lengths, which is not the correct solution to the problem. 

In the problem, Memory can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle in one second, and the length of each side should be an integer. The program does not take into account the fact that the triangle must remain non-degenerate at all times.

For example, if we start with a triangle of side length 6 and want to get a triangle of side length 3, the program will output 3, which is incorrect. The correct solution is 4, as shown in the example: (6,6,6) → (6,6,3) → (6,4,3) → (3,4,3) → (3,3,3).

A correct solution would involve finding the minimum number of steps required to reduce the side lengths from x to y, while ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate at all times. 

Here is a correct solution in Python:
```python
def min_steps(x, y):
    steps = 0
    while x > y:
        if x > 2 * y:
            x -= (x - 2 * y) // 2 + (x - 2 * y) % 2
        else:
            x -= 1
        steps += 1
    return steps

x, y = map(int, input().split())
print(min_steps(x, y))
```
This solution first checks if the current side length x is greater than twice the target side length y. If it is, it reduces x by the maximum possible amount while keeping the triangle non-degenerate. If x is not greater than twice y, it simply decrements x by 1. It repeats this process until x is equal to y, counting the number of steps required.
