The values of `x` and `y` are updated based on the input. `x` and `y` are assigned the values of two integers input by the user, split by a space. The previous condition that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100 000 is no longer guaranteed, as the new values of `x` and `y` are determined by the user's input. The only guarantee is that `x` and `y` are integers.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
