Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly solve the problem of finding the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length x into an equilateral triangle of side length y. 

The code simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which does not account for the fact that at each step, only one side of the triangle can be modified, and the triangle must remain non-degenerate (i.e., have positive area).

For example, when x = 22 and y = 4, the code will output 18, which is incorrect. The correct output is 6, as shown in the example in the problem description. The correct solution involves finding a sequence of triangle side lengths that decreases the difference between the current triangle and the target triangle at each step, while keeping the triangle non-degenerate. The given code does not implement this logic correctly.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
