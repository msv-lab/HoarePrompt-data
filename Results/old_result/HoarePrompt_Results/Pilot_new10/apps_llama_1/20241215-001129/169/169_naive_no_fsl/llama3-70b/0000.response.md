Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the given operations. The program first counts the number of minus and plus operations, then it checks if the number of minus operations is greater than the number of plus operations.

If the number of minus operations is greater than the number of plus operations, it means that Vasya must have started with at least as many stones as the number of minus operations, because he cannot take a stone from an empty pile. Therefore, after making all the operations, the minimum number of stones that can be left in the pile is 0.

If the number of minus operations is not greater than the number of plus operations, it means that Vasya can start with 0 stones and still make all the operations. In this case, the minimum number of stones that can be left in the pile after making all the operations is the difference between the number of plus and minus operations.

The program handles all possible cases correctly, including the edge cases where the number of minus or plus operations is 0. The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the program. Therefore, the correctness of the program is True.
