To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

1. `n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100. This condition remains unchanged as the code does not modify `n`.
2. `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters. This condition also remains unchanged since the code does not alter `s`.
3. The third character of `s` determines the initial state of `stones`. If the third character is '+', then `stones` is either 1 or 2. If the third character is '-', then `stones` is 0. For any other third character, `stones` and other variables remain unchanged.

Now, let's consider the effect of the code `stones = max(0, stones - 1)`:

- If `stones` is 0, then `stones - 1` will be -1, but `max(0, -1)` returns 0, so `stones` remains 0.
- If `stones` is 1, then `stones - 1` will be 0, and `max(0, 0)` returns 0, so `stones` becomes 0.
- If `stones` is 2, then `stones - 1` will be 1, and `max(0, 1)` returns 1, so `stones` becomes 1.
- For any other value of `stones`, the operation will similarly reduce `stones` by 1, unless `stones` is already 0, in which case it will stay 0.

Given these rules, we can deduce the following:

- If the third character of `s` is '+', then `stones` could initially be 1 or 2. After executing the code, `stones` will be 0 if it was initially 1, and it will be 1 if it was initially 2.
- If the third character of `s` is '-', then `stones` is initially 0, and after executing the code, `stones` will still be 0.
- For any other third character in `s`, the state of `stones` (and other variables) remains unchanged, but since `stones` is reduced by 1 unless it's 0, if `stones` was not 0, it will decrease by 1, and if it was 0, it will remain 0.

Thus, the output state reflects these changes:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string with at least 3 characters. If the third character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is either 0 (if initially 1) or 1 (if initially 2). If the third character of `s` is '-', then `stones` is 0. For any other third character in `s`, `stones` is either 0 (if initially 0) or decreased by 1 from its previous value (if not 0).**
