Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not correctly solve the problem as described. The problem asks for the minimal possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making the given operations, but the code instead calculates the maximum of 0 and the difference between the number of '+' operations and the number of '-' operations.

The issue with the code is that it assumes the initial number of stones is 0. However, the problem states that the pile was non-empty before each operation of taking one stone from the pile, which means the initial number of stones must be at least equal to the number of '-' operations.

For example, if the input is "3" and "---", the code will output 0, which is correct. However, if the input is "2" and "--", the code will also output 0, but this is incorrect because the initial number of stones must be at least 2.

A correct solution would involve finding the minimum initial number of stones that allows all the operations to be performed without the pile being empty, and then calculating the final number of stones after making all the operations.

Here is an example of a correct solution:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    min_stones = 0
    for operation in s:
        if operation == '-':
            min_stones += 1
    stones = min_stones
    for operation in s:
        if operation == '+':
            stones += 1
        elif operation == '-':
            stones -= 1
    print(stones)
```
This solution first calculates the minimum initial number of stones required to perform all the '-' operations, and then calculates the final number of stones after making all the operations.
