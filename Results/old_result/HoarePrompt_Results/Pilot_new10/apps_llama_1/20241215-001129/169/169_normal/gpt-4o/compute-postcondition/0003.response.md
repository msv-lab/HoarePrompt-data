According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string `s` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string equal to the user's input, and `stones` is 0. For the loop to execute, `s` must have at least 1 character, and `operation` is the first character in the string `s`. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string equal to the user's input that must have at least 1 character, `stones` is 0, `operation` is the first character in the string `s`**
