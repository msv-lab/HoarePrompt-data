The code `stones += 1` increments the value of `stones` by 1. Initially, `stones` is either 0 or 1. After the increment operation, `stones` will be either 1 or 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, `n` remains a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, and `s` remains a string that must have at least 2 characters, with `operation` being the second character in the string `s`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string that must have at least 2 characters, `operation` is the second character in the string `s`, `stones` is either 1 or 2**
