Correctness: **True**.

The code correctly implements the logic to find the minimal possible number of stones in the pile after performing the given operations. It counts the number of '+' and '-' characters in the string `s`, which represent the addition and removal of stones, respectively. The difference between the counts of '+' and '-' characters gives the net change in the number of stones. If the number of '-' characters is greater than the number of '+' characters, it means that Vasya had to start with at least as many stones as the number of '-' characters to avoid an empty pile, so the minimum possible number of stones left is 0. Otherwise, the minimum possible number of stones left is the net increase in stones, which is `plus_count - minus_count`. The code correctly handles all the examples provided in the problem description. 

The output hints agree with the code, and they describe the logic implemented in the code. The code does not validate `n` or `s` against the implied constraints, but this does not affect the correctness of the code because the problem description assumes that the input is valid. The code correctly calculates the minimum possible number of stones left in the pile after performing the operations, as described in the problem description. 

Therefore, the code is correct, and the answer is Correctness: **True**.
