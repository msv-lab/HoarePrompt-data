Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string that must have at least 3 characters. If `operation` is '+', then if the third character of `s` is '+', `stones` is either 2 or 3, if the third character of `s` is '-', then `stones` is 1, and for any other third character in `s`, the value of `stones` is incremented by 1 from its previous state. If `operation` is not '+', then if the third character of `s` is '+', `stones` is either 1 or 2, if the third character of `s` is '-' and `operation` is '-', then `stones` is 0, for any other third character in `s` and `operation` is '-', `stones` is either 0 (if initially 0) or decreased by 1 from its previous value (if not 0), and if `operation` is not '-' (nor '+'), the state of `n`, `s`, and other variables remains unchanged, implying that if the third character of `s` is '+', then `stones` is either 1 or 2, if the third character of `s` is '-', then `stones` is 0, and for any other third character in `s`, the state of `stones` and other variables remains as initially stated in the precondition.**
