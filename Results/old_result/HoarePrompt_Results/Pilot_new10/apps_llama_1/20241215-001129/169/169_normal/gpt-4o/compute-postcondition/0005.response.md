The value of `stones` is incremented by 1, so `stones` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string equal to the user's input that must have at least 1 character, `stones` is 1, `operation` is the first character in the string `s` and the current value of `operation` is '+'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer in the range 1 <= n <= 100, `s` is a string equal to the user's input that must have at least 1 character, `stones` is 1, `operation` is '+'**
