The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters, but it has access to two input variables: `n`, a positive integer from 1 to 100, and `s`, a string of length `n` consisting only of '+' and '-' characters. After executing the function body, the return value is not specified in the problem description. Therefore, based on the given constraints, the functionality of the function `func` is to have access to a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters, but the return value is not defined in the problem.


Functionality: **The function has access to a positive integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of '+' and '-' characters, but the return value is not specified.**
