The code `minus_count = s.count('-')` introduces a new variable `minus_count` and assigns it the value of the number of occurrences of the character '-' in the string `s`. 

The initial state has `n` as an input integer and `s` as the input string. These variables are not affected by the code.

The new variable `minus_count` is equal to the number of '-' characters in `s`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `minus_count` is the number of '-' characters in `s`.**
