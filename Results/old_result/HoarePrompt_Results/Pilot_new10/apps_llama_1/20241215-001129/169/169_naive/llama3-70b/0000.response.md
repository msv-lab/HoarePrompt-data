Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function seems to be correct based on the problem description. It calculates the number of '-' and '+' operations and then determines the minimum possible number of stones that can be in the pile after making these operations. 

The key insight here is that the minimum possible number of stones after making the operations can be determined by the difference between the number of '+' and '-' operations, because Vasya can start with any number of stones that allows him to perform all the '-' operations. 

If the number of '-' operations is greater than the number of '+' operations, it means that Vasya must have started with at least as many stones as there are '-' operations. In this case, the minimum number of stones he can end up with is 0, because he can start with the exact number of stones needed to perform all the '-' operations and end up with no stones. 

If the number of '-' operations is less than or equal to the number of '+' operations, the minimum number of stones Vasya can end up with is the difference between the number of '+' and '-' operations, because he can start with 0 stones and perform all the '+' operations before performing the '-' operations. 

The provided function correctly implements this logic, so it should work correctly for all possible inputs.
