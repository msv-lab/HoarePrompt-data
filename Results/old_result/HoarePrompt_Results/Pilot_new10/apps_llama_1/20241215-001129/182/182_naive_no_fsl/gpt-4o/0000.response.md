Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle negative input angles correctly. When a negative angle is input, it will be normalized to an equivalent positive angle between 0 and 360. However, the number of turns required to minimize the deviation from vertical is different for negative angles.

For example, if we input -60, the normalized angle is 300. But in the problem description, a negative angle represents counter-clockwise rotation, and the image from the camera is rotated clockwise by the same amount. So, in this case, the image is rotated 60 degrees clockwise. To minimize the deviation from vertical, we need 3 turns of 90 degrees clockwise, as explained in the problem description.

However, the program calculates the number of turns as (360 - 300) // 90 % 4 = 2, which is incorrect.

Here's the correct Python function:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360
    turns = round(normalized_angle / 90) % 4
    print(turns)
```

Or another correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360
    min_deviation = float('inf')
    min_turns = 0
    for turns in range(4):
        total_angle = (90 * turns) - normalized_angle
        if total_angle < 0:
            total_angle += 360
        deviation = total_angle if total_angle <= 180 else 360 - total_angle
        if deviation < min_deviation:
            min_deviation = deviation
            min_turns = turns
    print(min_turns)
```
