Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the required functionality as described in the problem description. 

The issue lies in the line where the `normalized_angle` is calculated. The current implementation does not correctly handle negative input angles. 

The line `normalized_angle = x % 360` will not produce the correct result for negative input angles. For example, if the input angle is -60, the `normalized_angle` will be -60, but it should be 300 (which is equivalent to -60 degrees).

Additionally, the line `turns = (360 - normalized_angle) // 90 % 4` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of 90-degree turns required to achieve the minimum deviation from the vertical. 

To correctly calculate the minimum number of turns, we should consider the absolute difference between the input angle and the nearest multiple of 90 degrees. 

Here's a corrected version of the program:

```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    normalized_angle = x % 360
    if normalized_angle < 0:
        normalized_angle += 360
    turns = round((normalized_angle - 360 * round(normalized_angle / 360)) / -90) % 4
    if turns < 0:
        turns += 4
    print(turns)
```
This corrected version first normalizes the input angle to be within the range of 0 to 360 degrees. Then it calculates the minimum number of 90-degree turns required to achieve the minimum deviation from the vertical. 

This version correctly handles both positive and negative input angles and ensures that the result is within the range of 0 to 3.
