The function `func` accepts no parameters but reads an integer `x` from the input, where `x` represents the camera angle in degrees, ranging from -10^18 to 10^18. A positive value of `x` denotes a clockwise camera rotation, while a negative value denotes a counter-clockwise rotation. 

However, the output of the function is not provided. To accurately describe the functionality, the output or return value needs to be specified.


Given the lack of specific output details in your prompt, I'll provide a general description based on typical expectations for such a function. Normally, a function like this might return a value indicating the final orientation or position after the rotation, or it might return a confirmation of the rotation direction based on the input angle.


For the sake of providing a structured answer without specific output details:

Functionality: **The function reads an integer camera angle in degrees from the input, interprets the rotation direction based on the sign of the angle, and presumably returns or affects the system based on this angle, though the exact return value or effect is not specified.**
