To calculate the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given code on the variables.

The given code is `b = z // i * x`. We know that `z = y / x` and `z` is at least 9, `i` is 3, and `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`.

Since `z = y / x` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` is an integer. Given that `z` is at least 9 and `i` is 3, `z // i` will be the integer division of `z` by 3, resulting in an integer value.

The expression `z // i * x` can be simplified as `(y / x) // 3 * x`, which further simplifies to `y // 3` because the `x` in the division and multiplication cancel each other out.

Therefore, `b` is assigned the value of `y // 3`, which means `b` is the integer division of `y` by 3.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9`, `x` and `y` are integers such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z = y / x` and is at least 9, `i` is 3, `a` is `3 * x`, and `b` is `y // 3`.**
