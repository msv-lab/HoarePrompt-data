To solve this, let's follow the steps and analyze the given Python code snippet based on the initial state.

Given Initial State: 
- `a` is equal to the original value of `b`.
- `b` is equal to the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b` and must not be 0.
- `a` is an integer.
- `b` is an integer.

The code snippet is:
```python
a, b = b, a % b
```

Now, analyzing the code:
1. The value of `a` becomes the original value of `b`.
2. The value of `b` becomes the remainder of the original `a` divided by the new `a` (which is the original `b`).

Considering the initial state and applying the changes:
- The new `a` is the original `b`.
- The new `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`.

Since `a` is now the original `b`, and `b` is the remainder of the original `a` (which is now `a` in the new context) divided by the new `a` (which is the original `b`), we can see that `b` becomes `a % b` where `a` and `b` are the new values.

However, to maintain clarity with the original values, let's denote the original `a` as `orig_a` and the original `b` as `orig_b`. Thus:
- `orig_a` equals `orig_b` (from the initial state).
- `orig_b` is the remainder of `orig_a` divided by `orig_b`, but since we're updating `a` and `b`, let's express the new values directly:
  - New `a` equals `orig_b`.
  - New `b` equals `orig_a % orig_b`.

But since `orig_a` equals `orig_b` initially, this implies that `orig_b` (the new `a`) is the remainder of `orig_b` divided by itself, which would be 0. However, the initial state specifies that `b` (which is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`) must not be 0. This creates a contradiction unless we interpret the transformation correctly in the context of the algorithm, which typically involves the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

Given the nature of the assignment and the condition that `b` must not be 0, we should understand that the initial state's condition that `a` equals `b` might be a simplification or a specific case. In a general sense, when applying the Euclidean algorithm, `a` and `b` are updated in such a way that `a` becomes `b`, and `b` becomes the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` is 0. The GCD is then `a`.

However, sticking strictly to the given initial conditions and the code snippet without assuming additional context:
- `a` becomes the original `b`.
- `b` becomes the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, which is essentially what `b` was initially defined as.

So, the output state, considering the direct interpretation of the given code and initial conditions without imposing additional context, would reflect the swap and the new remainder calculation. But given the conditions, it seems there might be a misunderstanding in the initial setup since `a` equals `b` initially would imply `b` (the remainder) is 0, which contradicts the given that `b` must not be 0.

Correcting the interpretation based on standard mathematical operations and the intention behind such code (typically for GCD calculation):
- `a` and `b` are integers.
- The operation performed is a step in the Euclidean algorithm, where `a` and `b` are updated.

The specific values of `a` and `b` after the operation depend on their original values, but given the initial conditions and the code, we can say:
- `a` is now the original `b`.
- `b` is now the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`.

Given the potential for confusion in the initial setup, let's focus on the general outcome of the code snippet:
- `a` becomes the value that `b` had.
- `b` becomes the remainder of what `a` was divided by what `b` was.

Output State: **`a` is the original value of `b`, `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, `a` and `b` are integers.**
