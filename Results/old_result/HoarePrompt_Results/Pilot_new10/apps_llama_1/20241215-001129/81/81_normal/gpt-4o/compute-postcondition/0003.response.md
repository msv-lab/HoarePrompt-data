The code `z = y // x` assigns the value of the integer division of `y` by `x` to `z`. Given that `y` is divisible by `x`, this means that `z` will be an integer with no remainder. The previous values of `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are not affected by this assignment. 

Since `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9` and `y` is divisible by `x`, `z` will be an integer greater than or equal to 1. The value of `z` can be expressed as `y // x` or equivalently as `y / x` since `y` is divisible by `x`. 

The conditions `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9` are not directly related to the calculation of `z` but are part of the initial state and remain valid. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9` and `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9`, `y` is divisible by `x`, and `z` equals `y // x` or `y / x`.

Output State: **`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9` and `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9`, `y` is divisible by `x`, and `z` equals `y / x`.**
