`a` is assigned the value of `i` multiplied by `x`. The value of `i` is 3, so the value of `a` is 3 times `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9` and `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9`, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z = y / x` and is at least 9, `i` is 3, and `a` is `3 * x`.
Output State: **`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9` and `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9`, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z = y / x` and is at least 9, `i` is 3, and `a` is `3 * x`.**
