To analyze the functionality of `func_2(a, b)`, we must consider what the code does, rather than solely relying on the annotations. The function takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are described as positive integers. It then returns the integer result of the product of `a` and `b` divided by the result of `func_1(a, b)`.

However, there's a critical aspect to consider: the code does not check if the result of `func_1(a, b)` is zero before performing the division. If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, this would result in a `ZeroDivisionError` because division by zero is undefined.

Since the annotations and return postconditions do not address what happens if `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, we must include this potential edge case in our analysis of the function's functionality.

Given the information and focusing on what the code does:

- The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are expected to be positive integers.
- It calculates the product of `a` and `b`.
- It attempts to divide this product by the result of `func_1(a, b)`.
- If `func_1(a, b)` returns a non-zero value, the function returns the integer result of this division.
- If `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` because it attempts to divide by zero.

Therefore, the functionality of `func_2(a, b)` includes a potential edge case where it may raise an exception if `func_1(a, b)` returns zero, which is not explicitly covered by the provided annotations or return postconditions.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, calculates their product, and attempts to divide it by the result of `func_1(a, b)`. If `func_1(a, b)` returns a non-zero value, it returns the integer result of this division; otherwise, it raises a `ZeroDivisionError`. **
