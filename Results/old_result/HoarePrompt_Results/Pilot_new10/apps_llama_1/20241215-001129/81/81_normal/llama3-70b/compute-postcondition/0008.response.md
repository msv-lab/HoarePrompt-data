The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, where both `a` and `b` are integers. After executing the function body, the function returns the greatest common divisor of the original `a` and 0, which simplifies to the absolute value of `a`. However, given that `a` is defined in this context as its own GCD with 0, the function effectively returns `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the value of `a`.**
