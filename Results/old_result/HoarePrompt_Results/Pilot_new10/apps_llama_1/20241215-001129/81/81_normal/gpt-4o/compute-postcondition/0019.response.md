The code `b = z // i * x` assigns a new value to `b`. We know that `z = y / x` and is at least 4, `i` is 2, and `x` is an integer such that `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9`. Given that `z = y / x` and `i` is 2, we can substitute `z` and `i` into the equation for `b` to get `b = (y / x) // 2 * x`. Since `y` is divisible by `x`, `y / x` is an integer. Therefore, `b = (y / x) // 2 * x` simplifies to `b = (y // 2)`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9` and `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9`, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z = y / x` and is at least 4, `i` is 2, `a = 2 * x`, and `b = y // 2`.

Output State: **`l`, `r`, `x`, and `y` are integers such that `1 <= l <= r <= 10^9` and `1 <= x <= y <= 10^9`, `y` is divisible by `x`, `z = y / x` and is at least 4, `i` is 2, `a = 2 * x`, and `b = y // 2`**
