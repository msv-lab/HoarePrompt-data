Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately implements the problem description. It correctly calculates the number of good pairs of integers (a, b) within the range [l, r] where GCD(a, b) equals x and LCM(a, b) equals y.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. **Checking divisibility**: The code first checks if y is divisible by x. If not, it returns 0, as there can be no good pairs (a, b) in this case.

2. **Calculating z**: If y is divisible by x, it calculates z as y // x. This is a key step, as z represents the factor by which x is multiplied to get both a and b in the pair (a, b).

3. **Iterating over factors of z**: The code then iterates over all factors i of z. For each factor i, it calculates a = i * x and b = z // i * x.

4. **Checking conditions for good pairs**: It checks if both a and b are within the range [l, r] and if their GCD equals x and their LCM equals y.

5. **Counting good pairs**: If the conditions are met, it increments the count by 1 if a == b (since (a, a) is considered the same pair) and by 2 if a!= b (since (a, b) and (b, a) are considered different pairs).

The code handles all edge cases correctly, including cases where x equals y or where l equals r. The examples provided in the problem description also align with the code's output.

The output hints provided in the problem description are consistent with the code's functionality, and they do not reveal any potential incorrect cases.

Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases, and the Correctness is **True**.
