Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values, `cycles` is a list of lists containing the indices of detected cycles. If the number of cycles is 1, the value 0 has been printed. Otherwise, if `no_reverse_components` is greater than 0, `no_reverse_components` has been returned; otherwise, 1 has been returned.***
