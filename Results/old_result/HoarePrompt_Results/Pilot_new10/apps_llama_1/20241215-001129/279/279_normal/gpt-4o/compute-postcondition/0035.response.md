The code `cycle.append(x)` adds the value of `x` to the end of the list `cycle`. We are given that `x` is `p[1] - 1` and `cycle` initially contains one element which is 1.

After executing the code, the list `cycle` will contain two elements: 1 and `p[1] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the cycle, index 1, and `p[1] - 1` are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing one element which is the list of indices of the detected cycle, `i` is 1, `x` is `p[1] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing two elements: 1 and `p[1] - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the cycle, index 1, and `p[1] - 1` are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing one element which is the list of indices of the detected cycle, `i` is 1, `x` is `p[1] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing two elements: 1 and `p[1] - 1`.**
