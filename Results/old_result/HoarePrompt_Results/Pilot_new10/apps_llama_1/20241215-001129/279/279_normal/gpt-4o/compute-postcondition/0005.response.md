The code initializes a list `visited` of size `n` with all elements set to `False`. The value of `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` is a list containing the string representation of `n`, `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n`, `p` is a list of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n`, `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n` are either 0 or 1, `b` is a list of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n`, and `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values all set to `False`.**
