The value of `ans` is incremented by 1. The initial state of `ans` is not specified, so we can only say that `ans` has increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 2, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers of length `n` containing binary digits, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 2, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers of length `n` containing binary digits, `i` is 2, `ans` is increased by 1**
