Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers. If `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the detected cycle are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing at least two elements where the first element is the original detected cycle and the second element is the sequence of indices `cycle` representing the detected cycle, `i` is 1, and `cycle` contains the sequence of indices representing the detected cycle. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
