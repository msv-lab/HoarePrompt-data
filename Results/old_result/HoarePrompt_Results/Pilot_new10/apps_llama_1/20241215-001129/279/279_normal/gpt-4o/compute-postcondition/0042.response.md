To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, let's analyze the provided initial state and the code itself.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5,
- `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`,
- `p` and `b` are lists of integers,
- `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the detected cycle are `True`,
- `cycles` is a list containing one element which is the list of indices of the detected cycle,
- `i` is 1,
- `cycle` contains the sequence of indices representing the detected cycle, with `x` being the index that leads into the cycle.

Given Code:
```python
cycles.append(cycle)
```

The impact of this code is that it appends the `cycle` list to the `cycles` list. Initially, `cycles` contained one element which was the list of indices of the detected cycle. After executing this code, `cycles` will contain at least two elements: the original list of indices of the detected cycle and the `cycle` list which represents the sequence of indices of the detected cycle.

Output State: 
`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, 
`data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, 
`p` and `b` are lists of integers, 
`visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the detected cycle are `True`, 
`cycles` is a list containing at least two elements: the first element is the list of indices of the detected cycle and the second element is the list of indices representing the detected cycle, 
`i` is 1, 
`cycle` contains the sequence of indices representing the detected cycle.

Therefore, considering the specifics of the given initial state and the effect of the code:
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the detected cycle are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing at least two elements where the first element is the original detected cycle and the second element is the sequence of indices `cycle` representing the detected cycle, `i` is 1, `cycle` contains the sequence of indices representing the detected cycle**
