The function `func_1` reads input from the standard input, which consists of three lines. The first line contains an integer `n`, representing the number of skewers. The second line contains a permutation sequence `p`, and the third line contains a reversal sequence `b`. The function processes the skewers according to the provided permutation and reversal instructions.

It first identifies cycles in the permutation sequence `p`. Then, it calculates the number of cycles where no reversal is required, i.e., all elements in the cycle have a corresponding value of 0 in the reversal sequence `b`. If there is only one cycle, the function prints 0. Otherwise, it prints the number of cycles where no reversal is required if this number is greater than 0; otherwise, it prints 1.

The function handles the edge case where the input is in the specified format but does not explicitly handle cases where the input format is invalid or where the values in the permutation sequence `p` or the reversal sequence `b` are outside the specified range. 

Functionality: ** The function reads the number of skewers, a permutation sequence, and a reversal sequence from the standard input, identifies cycles in the permutation, calculates the number of cycles where no reversal is required, and prints 0 if there is only one cycle, the number of cycles where no reversal is required if this number is greater than 0, or 1 otherwise, assuming the input is in the specified format. **
