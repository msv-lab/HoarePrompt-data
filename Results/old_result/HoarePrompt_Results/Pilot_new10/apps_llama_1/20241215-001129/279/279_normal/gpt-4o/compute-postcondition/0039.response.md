The value of `x` is `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`, and this value is appended to the `cycle` list. The `cycle` list initially contains two elements: 1 and `p[1] - 1`. After the code is executed, the `cycle` list will contain three elements: 1, `p[1] - 1`, and `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the cycle, index 1, `p[1] - 1`, and `p[p[1] - 1] - 1` are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing one element which is the list of indices of the detected cycle, `i` is 1, `x` is `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing three elements: 1, `p[1] - 1`, and `p[p[1] - 1] - 1`.**
