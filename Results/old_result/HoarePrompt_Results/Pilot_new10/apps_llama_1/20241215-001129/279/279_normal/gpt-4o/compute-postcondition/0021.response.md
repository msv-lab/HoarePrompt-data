The value of `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing the elements: 0, `p[0] - 1`, and `x`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` is a list containing the string representation of `n`, `p` is a list of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n` where `p[0]` is not equal to 1, `b` is a list of integers corresponding to `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n`, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[0]` is `True`, `visited[p[0]-1]` is `True`, `visited[p[p[0] - 1] - 1]` is `True`, and other values are `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing three elements: 0, `p[0] - 1`, and `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 2*10^5, `data` is a list containing the string representation of `n`, `p` is a list of integers corresponding to `p_1`, `p_2`,..., `p_n` where `p[0]` is not equal to 1, `b` is a list of integers corresponding to `b_1`, `b_2`,..., `b_n`, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where `visited[0]` is `True`, `visited[p[0]-1]` is `True`, `visited[p[p[0] - 1] - 1]` is `True`, and other values are `False`, `cycles` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `x` is `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing three elements: 0, `p[0] - 1`, and `p[p[0] - 1] - 1`.**
