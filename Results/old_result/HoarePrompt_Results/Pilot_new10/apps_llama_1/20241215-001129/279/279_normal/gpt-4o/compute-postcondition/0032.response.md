The value of `x` is updated to `p[x] - 1`. Given that `x` is initially 1, `x` becomes `p[1] - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the cycle and index 1 are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing one element which is the list of indices of the detected cycle, `i` is 1, `x` is `p[1] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing one element which is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the cycle and index 1 are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing one element which is the list of indices of the detected cycle, `i` is 1, `x` is `p[1] - 1`, and `cycle` is a list containing one element which is 1**
