The given code snippet is a print statement that prints the value of `ans`. This statement does not modify any variables. 

The print statement will output the current value of `ans`, which is the sum of the number of indices where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` and the number of indices where `b[i]` is 0.

The values of the variables `n`, `p`, `b`, and `ans` are not changed by the code. The `ans` is printed to the console.

Output State: **`n` is the original input integer, `p` is the list of original input integers, `b` is the list of original binary digits, `ans` is the sum of the number of indices where `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1` and the number of indices where `b[i]` is 0, and `ans` has been printed.**
