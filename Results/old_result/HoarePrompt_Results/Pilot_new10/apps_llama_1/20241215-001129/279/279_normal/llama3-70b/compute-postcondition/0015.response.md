Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `p` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers of length `n` containing binary digits, `i` is 1. If `b[i]` is 0 and `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`, then `ans` is the initial value of `ans` + 1. If `b[i]` is 1, then the state of `ans` is unchanged from its initial state, given that `p[i]` is not equal to `i + 1`***
