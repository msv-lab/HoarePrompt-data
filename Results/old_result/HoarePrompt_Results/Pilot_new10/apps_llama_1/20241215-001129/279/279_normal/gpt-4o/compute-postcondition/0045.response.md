The code `cycle = []` affects the variable `cycle` by assigning it an empty list. The previous value of `cycle` was a sequence of indices representing the detected cycle, but now it becomes an empty list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 2*10^5, `data` contains the string representation of the original `n`, `p` and `b` are lists of integers, if `visited[i]` is `False`, then `visited` is a list of `n` boolean values where at least the indices corresponding to the detected cycle are `True`, `cycles` is a list containing at least two elements where the first element is the original detected cycle and the second element is the sequence of indices `cycle` representing the detected cycle, `i` is 2, and `cycle` is an empty list `[]`.**
