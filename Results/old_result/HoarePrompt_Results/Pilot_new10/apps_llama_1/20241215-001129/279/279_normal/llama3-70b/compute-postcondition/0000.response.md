The value of `n` is updated to an input integer, overwriting its initial value as a positive integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to the original value of `n`, and `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones of length equal to the original value of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `p` is a permutation of integers from 1 to the original value of `n`, and `b` is a sequence of zeros and ones of length equal to the original value of `n`.**
