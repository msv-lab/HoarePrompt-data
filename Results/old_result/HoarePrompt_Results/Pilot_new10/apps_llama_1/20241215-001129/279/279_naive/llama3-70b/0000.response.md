Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem. It simply checks if each element in the permutation `p` is equal to its 1-indexed position and if each element in the sequence `b` is 1. This approach does not consider the actual constraints of the problem, which require that every skewer visits each of the 2n placements.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
2 3 1
0 0 0
```
The program will output `6`, which is incorrect. The correct output is `1`, because Pavel can change any element of `b` to 1 to satisfy the condition.

A correct solution would involve checking the cycle structure of the permutation `p` and the parity of the sequence `b`. If the permutation `p` has more than one cycle, or if the sum of the elements in the sequence `b` is even, then Pavel needs to make changes to satisfy the condition.

In the given code, the lines `ans += 1` are not considering the actual constraints of the problem and are simply incrementing the count based on the position and value of the elements. This approach is not correct and will not work for all possible inputs. 

The correct approach would involve using graph theory and cycle detection algorithms to determine the minimum number of changes required to satisfy the condition. 

So, the given program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and therefore, it is incorrect.
