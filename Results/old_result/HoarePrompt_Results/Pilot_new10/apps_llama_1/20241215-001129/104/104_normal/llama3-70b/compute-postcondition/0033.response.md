To calculate the result, let's first understand what the given code does. The code updates the value of `max_erase` to be the maximum of its current value and the expression `j - i - 1`. 

Given that `j` is `i + 2`, we can substitute `j` in the expression `j - i - 1` to get `(i + 2) - i - 1`, which simplifies to `1`. 

So, `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `1`. 

The initial state provides that `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n`, and `j` is `i + 2`. These conditions are not changed by the given code snippet. 

Therefore, after the code is executed, `n` remains an input integer greater than 1, `a` remains a list of input integers, `i` remains less than `n`, `j` remains `i + 2`, and `max_erase` is updated to be at least `1` (or its previous value if that was greater than `1`).

Given the information, the output state is: `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and `1`**
