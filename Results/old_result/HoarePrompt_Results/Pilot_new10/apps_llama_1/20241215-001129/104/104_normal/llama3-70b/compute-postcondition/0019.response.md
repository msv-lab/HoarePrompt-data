Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`. If the sequence from index `i` to `j` in `a` forms an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, then `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 0. Otherwise, `max_erase` remains unchanged, which in this case is the same as its previous value since there is no else part to modify it.***
