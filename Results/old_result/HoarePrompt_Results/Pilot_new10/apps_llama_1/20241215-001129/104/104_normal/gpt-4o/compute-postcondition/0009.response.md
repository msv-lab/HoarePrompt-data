To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the given information and the loop code.

The loop code calculates `max_erase` as the maximum of its current value and the difference between the current element `a[i]` and the previous element `a[i - 1]`, minus 1. This process is repeated for each pair of adjacent elements in the list `a`, starting from the second element (index 1) to the last element.

Given the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe a pattern:
- `n` must be at least 2, 3, and 4, respectively, for the loop to execute 1, 2, and 3 times.
- `a` remains a list of `n` integers with the same properties (1 ≤ a1 < a2 <... < an ≤ 10^3).
- `max_erase` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the difference between each pair of consecutive elements minus 1.
- `i` increases by 1 after each iteration, indicating its value after the loop finishes will be `n - 1`, since the loop iterates from 1 to `n - 1`.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is 1), `max_erase` will remain 0, as there are no pairs of elements to calculate the difference from.

After all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `n` remains the same, as it is an input integer representing the number of elements in `a`.
- `a` also remains unchanged, as the loop only reads from `a` and does not modify it.
- `max_erase` will hold the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `a`, minus 1. This represents the maximum number of elements that could be "erased" or are missing between any two consecutive elements in the sorted list `a`.
- `i` will be `n - 1`, as it iterates from 1 to `n - 1`.

Therefore, considering all possible scenarios, including when the loop does not execute (`n` equals 1), the output state can be generalized as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` integers where 1 ≤ a1 < a2 <... < an ≤ 10^3, `max_erase` is the maximum of 0 and the maximum difference between any two consecutive elements in `a` minus 1, and `i` is `n - 1` if `n` > 1, otherwise `i` will be 0 because the loop doesn't execute.**
