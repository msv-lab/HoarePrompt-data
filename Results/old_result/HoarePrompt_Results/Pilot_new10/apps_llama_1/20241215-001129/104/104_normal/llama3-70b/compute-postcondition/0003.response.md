According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, and `max_erase` is 0. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the starting point of the range.

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `a` is a list of input integers, `max_erase` is 0, `i` is 0**
