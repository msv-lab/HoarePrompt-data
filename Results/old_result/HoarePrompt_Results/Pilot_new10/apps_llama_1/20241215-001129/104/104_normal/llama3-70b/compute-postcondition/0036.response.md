To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer greater than `i + 3`
- `a` is a list of input integers
- `i` is less than `n - 2`
- `j` is `i + 3`

The code snippet is:
```python
max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
```
Given that `j` is `i + 3`, we can substitute `j` in the equation:
```python
max_erase = max(max_erase, (i + 3) - i - 1)
```
This simplifies to:
```python
max_erase = max(max_erase, 2)
```
Since the previous value of `max_erase` is not specified, we can only conclude that `max_erase` will be the maximum of its previous value and 2.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `a`, `i`, `j`) are not affected by this line of code, so they remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `n` is an input integer greater than `i + 3`
- `a` is a list of input integers
- `i` is less than `n - 2`
- `j` is `i + 3`
- `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 2.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than `i + 3`, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`, `max_erase` is the maximum of its previous value and 2**
