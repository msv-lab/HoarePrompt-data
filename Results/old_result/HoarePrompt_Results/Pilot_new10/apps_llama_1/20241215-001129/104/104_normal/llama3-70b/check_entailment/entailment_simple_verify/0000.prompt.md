You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: JATC and his friend Giraffe are currently in their room, solving some problems. Giraffe has written on the board an array $a_1$, $a_2$, ..., $a_n$ of integers, such that $1 \le a_1 < a_2 < \ldots < a_n \le 10^3$, and then went to the bathroom.

JATC decided to prank his friend by erasing some consecutive elements in the array. Since he doesn't want for the prank to go too far, he will only erase in a way, such that Giraffe can still restore the array using the information from the remaining elements. Because Giraffe has created the array, he's also aware that it's an increasing array and all the elements are integers in the range $[1, 10^3]$.

JATC wonders what is the greatest number of elements he can erase?


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 100$) — the number of elements in the array.

The second line of the input contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_1<a_2<\dots<a_n \le 10^3$) — the array written by Giraffe.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer — the maximum number of consecutive elements in the array that JATC can erase.

If it is impossible to erase even a single element, print $0$.


-----Examples-----
Input
6
1 3 4 5 6 9

Output
2
Input
3
998 999 1000

Output
2
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5

Output
4


-----Note-----

In the first example, JATC can erase the third and fourth elements, leaving the array $[1, 3, \_, \_, 6, 9]$. As you can see, there is only one way to fill in the blanks.

In the second example, JATC can erase the second and the third elements. The array will become $[998, \_, \_]$. Because all the elements are less than or equal to $1000$, the array is still can be restored. Note, that he can't erase the first $2$ elements.

In the third example, JATC can erase the first $4$ elements. Since all the elements are greater than or equal to $1$, Giraffe can still restore the array. Note, that he can't erase the last $4$ elements.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if all((a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j))):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
    print(max_erase)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased from the array. The current implementation checks if the subarray from index `i` to `j` is an arithmetic progression with a common difference of 1, but this is not the correct condition to determine if the erased elements can be restored.

A correct implementation should check if the erased elements can be uniquely determined from the remaining elements. This can be done by checking if the difference between the first and last elements of the remaining subarray is less than or equal to the length of the original array plus the length of the erased subarray.

For example, consider the input `5 1 2 3 4 5`. The program should output `4` because JATC can erase the first 4 elements, leaving the array `[5]`, and Giraffe can still restore the original array. However, the program outputs `0` because it does not correctly implement the logic to find the maximum number of consecutive elements that can be erased.

Here is a correct implementation in Python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            prefix = a[:i]
            suffix = a[j:]
            if not prefix and not suffix:
                continue
            min_prefix = min(prefix) if prefix else 1
            max_suffix = max(suffix) if suffix else 1000
            if j - i <= max_suffix - min_prefix:
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
    print(max_erase)
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no explicit parameters, but it implicitly takes a list of integers which is strictly increasing, contains between 1 and 100 elements, and each element is between 1 and 10^3 (inclusive).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_erase = 0
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            if all(a[k] - a[i] == k - i for k in range(i, j)):
                max_erase = max(max_erase, j - i - 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `max_erase` is the maximum length of any arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1 in the original list `a` minus 1, or 0 if no such sequence exists or if `n` is 0.
    print(max_erase)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
