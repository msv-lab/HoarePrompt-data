The code `a = list(map(int, input().split()))` is executed. This line of code accepts a list of space-separated integers as input, converts each integer to an integer type using `map(int, input().split())`, and then stores these integers in the list `a`.

The variable `n` was an input integer, but its value is not used in this code snippet. The initial state also mentioned a list of integers with certain properties, but this list is not used in the code snippet either.

The output state, considering the code that was executed, will reflect the new list `a` which contains integers from the input. Since the input could be anything, `a` will hold these input values as integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers**
