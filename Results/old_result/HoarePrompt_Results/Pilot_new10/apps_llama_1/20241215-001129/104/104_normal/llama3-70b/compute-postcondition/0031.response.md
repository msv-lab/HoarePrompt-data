Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of input integers, `i` is less than `n`, if all elements in the list `a` from index `i` to `j` are in an arithmetic sequence with a common difference of 1, then `max_erase` remains the same as before, otherwise, the state of `max_erase` is not changed because there is no else part to modify it, and `j` is `i + 1`.***
