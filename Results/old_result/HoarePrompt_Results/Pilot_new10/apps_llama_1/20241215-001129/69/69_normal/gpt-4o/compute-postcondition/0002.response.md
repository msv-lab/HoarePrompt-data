According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `operations`. If `operations` is not empty, the loop can execute. Since `n` is a positive integer and `operations` is a string of length `n`, we can conclude that `operations` is not empty. 

For the loop to execute, `op` must be the first character in the `operations` string. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is 0, `op` is the first character in `operations`**
