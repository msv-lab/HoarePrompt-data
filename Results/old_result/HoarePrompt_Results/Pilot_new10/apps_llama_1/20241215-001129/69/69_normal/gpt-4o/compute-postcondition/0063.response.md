Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `min_length` is positive infinity, `position_map` is a dictionary containing positions as keys and their corresponding values, with the initial position (0, 0) having a value of -1, `i` is 0, and `target_pos` is either `dx, 1 + dy` or `dx, -1 + dy` or `dx - 1, dy` or `dx + 1, dy` depending on the character at index `i` of `operations`, where either `dx` is not equal to 0 or `dy` is not equal to 0, or both. The current value of `target_pos` is a key in the `position_map`.**
