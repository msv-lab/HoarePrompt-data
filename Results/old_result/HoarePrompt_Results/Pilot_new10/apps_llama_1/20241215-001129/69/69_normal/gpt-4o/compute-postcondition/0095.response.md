The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `operations`, `x`, and `y`. `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', and `x` and `y` are integers. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on two possible cases. 

Case 1: The program returns 0. 
Case 2: The program returns the minimum distance between revisits to any position if such revisits occur, otherwise it returns -1. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n`, a string `operations` of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', and integers `x` and `y`, and return either 0, the minimum distance between revisits to any position, or -1 if no revisits occur.
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, operations, x, and y, and returns either 0, the minimum distance between revisits to any position, or -1 if no revisits occur.**
