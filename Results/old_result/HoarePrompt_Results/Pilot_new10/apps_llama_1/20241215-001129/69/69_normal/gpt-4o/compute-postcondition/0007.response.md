The code `final_y -= 1` decrements the value of `final_y` by 1. The initial value of `final_y` is 0, so the new value of `final_y` will be -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is 0, `final_y` is -1, `op` is 'D'**
