Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the net number of 'R' operations minus the net number of 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the net number of 'U' operations minus the net number of 'D' operations in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux` and is greater than or equal to 0, `dy` is `y - uy` and initially is greater than or equal to 0, the current value of `dy` is less than 0, `res` is 0, `op` is the first character in `ops` and is 'D', and the current value of `op` being 'D' and `dy` being less than 0 is true**
