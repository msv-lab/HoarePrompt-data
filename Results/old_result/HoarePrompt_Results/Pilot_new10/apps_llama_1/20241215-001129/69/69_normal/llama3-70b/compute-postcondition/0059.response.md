Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the net number of 'R' operations minus the net number of 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the net number of 'U' operations minus the net number of 'D' operations in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, if `op` equals 'R' and `dx` is greater than 0, then `dx` is `x - ux - 1` and is greater than or equal to 0. If `op` does not equal 'R' or `dx` is less than or equal to 0, then if `op` equals 'L' and `dx` is less than 0, `dx` is 0 and `x` equals `ux`, otherwise `res` is 1, `dx` is `x - ux` and is greater than or equal to 0. In all cases, `dy` is `y - uy` and is greater than or equal to 0, and the conditions regarding `op`, `dy`, and `dx` are maintained as per the given conditions.***
