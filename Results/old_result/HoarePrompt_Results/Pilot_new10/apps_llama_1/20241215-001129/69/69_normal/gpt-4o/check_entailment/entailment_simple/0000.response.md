Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the problem description. The problem asks to find the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed in the sequence of operations so that the robot ends up at the desired coordinates (x, y). However, the provided program does not actually try to find the minimum length of subsegment to change. 

Instead, it tries to find the minimum distance between revisits to any position, which is not the same as finding the minimum length of subsegment to change. The program does not consider the actual changes that need to be made to the sequence of operations to reach the desired coordinates.

For example, if the given sequence of operations is "RRRR" and the desired coordinates are (2, 0), the program will return -1 because it cannot find a revisit to any position that matches the desired coordinates. However, the correct answer is 2, because we can change the first two operations to "LL" to get the sequence "LLRR" which ends up at (2, 0).

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to actually try to find the minimum length of subsegment to change, rather than just looking for revisits to positions. This could involve iterating over all possible subsegments of the sequence of operations and checking if changing that subsegment would result in the robot ending up at the desired coordinates. 

Here is a corrected version of the program in Python:

```python
def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    min_length = float('inf')
    
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            for op1 in ['U', 'D', 'L', 'R']:
                for op2 in ['U', 'D', 'L', 'R']:
                    new_ops = list(operations)
                    new_ops[i] = op1
                    new_ops[j] = op2
                    new_ops = ''.join(new_ops)
                    final_x, final_y = 0, 0
                    for op in new_ops:
                        if op == 'U':
                            final_y += 1
                        elif op == 'D':
                            final_y -= 1
                        elif op == 'L':
                            final_x -= 1
                        elif op == 'R':
                            final_x += 1
                    if final_x == x and final_y == y:
                        min_length = min(min_length, j - i + 1)
    
    for i in range(n):
        for op in ['U', 'D', 'L', 'R']:
            new_ops = list(operations)
            new_ops[i] = op
            new_ops = ''.join(new_ops)
            final_x, final_y = 0, 0
            for op in new_ops:
                if op == 'U':
                    final_y += 1
                elif op == 'D':
                    final_y -= 1
                elif op == 'L':
                    final_x -= 1
                elif op == 'R':
                    final_x += 1
            if final_x == x and final_y == y:
                min_length = min(min_length, 1)
    
    final_x, final_y = 0, 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
    if final_x == x and final_y == y:
        min_length = min(min_length, 0)
    
    return min_length if min_length!= float('inf') else -1
```

This program checks all possible changes to the sequence of operations and returns the minimum length of subsegment that needs to be changed to reach the desired coordinates. If no such subsegment exists, it returns -1.
