Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` and `y` are input integers that have been updated based on the first operation in `ops`. If the current operation `op` is 'R', then `x` is incremented by 1 from its previous value based on the first operation in `ops`. If the current operation `op` is 'L', then `x` is decremented by 1 from its previous value which was updated based on the first operation in `ops`, and `y` remains the same as it was after the first operation in `ops`. If `op` is neither 'R' nor 'L', `x` and `y` retain the values they had after the first operation in `ops`.***
