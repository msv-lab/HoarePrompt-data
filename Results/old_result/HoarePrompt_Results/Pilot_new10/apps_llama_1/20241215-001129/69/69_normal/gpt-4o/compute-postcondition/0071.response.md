The value of `current_x` is incremented by 1. Since `current_x` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, we will assume it is `x`. Therefore, `x` becomes `x + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `final_x` is still the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, and the value of `dx` is updated to `x + 1 - final_x`. The value of `target_pos` may also be updated depending on its previous value, but since its previous value is one of `dx, 1 + dy`, `dx, -1 + dy`, `dx - 1, dy`, or `dx + 1, dy`, its new value will be one of `dx + 1, 1 + dy`, `dx + 1, -1 + dy`, `dx, 1 + dy`, or `dx + 2, dy` if `current_x` equals `x`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and greater than 1, `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is `x + 1`, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, `dx` is `x + 1 - final_x`, `dy` is `y - final_y`, `position_map` is a dictionary containing positions as keys and their corresponding values, with the initial position (0, 0) having a value of -1 and (`dx`, `dy`) having a value of `i`, `i` is 1, and `target_pos` is either `dx + 1, 1 + dy` or `dx + 1, -1 + dy` or `dx, 1 + dy` or `dx + 2, dy`**
