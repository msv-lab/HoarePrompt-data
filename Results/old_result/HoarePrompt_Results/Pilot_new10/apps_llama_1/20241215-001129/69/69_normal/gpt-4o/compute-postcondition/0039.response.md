Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is the difference between the counts of 'R' and 'L' operations in `operations`, `final_y` is the difference between the counts of 'U' and 'D' operations in `operations`, `dx` is `x - final_x`, and `dy` is `y - final_y`. The current values of `dx` and `dy` are both 0, meaning `x` equals `final_x` and `y` equals `final_y`.**
