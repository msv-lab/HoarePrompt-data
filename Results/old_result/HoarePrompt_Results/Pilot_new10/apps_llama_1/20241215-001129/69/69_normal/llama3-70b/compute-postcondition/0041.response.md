The code provided simply prints -1. This operation does not change the values of any variables; it merely outputs a specific value. Therefore, the state of all variables remains unchanged, but the value -1 has been returned at the output state.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, `dx` is less than 0 or `dy` is less than 0, and the value -1 has been returned**
