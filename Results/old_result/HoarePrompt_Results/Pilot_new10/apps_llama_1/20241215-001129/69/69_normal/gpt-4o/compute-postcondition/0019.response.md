To determine the output state, we should analyze how the given Python code affects the variables and their initial conditions.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n-1` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'
- `x` is an integer
- `y` is an integer

The code provided is:
```python
final_y += 1
```

However, there seems to be a discrepancy because the variable `final_y` is not mentioned in the initial state, but based on the instruction, we should consider its impact assuming `final_y` is meant to be `y` as no `final_y` is defined in the initial conditions. Assuming a typo and it's meant to affect `y`, let's proceed under that interpretation.

Given this, the value of `y` is incremented by 1. Since `y` was initially an integer, after the increment, `y` will still be an integer but with a value one greater than its initial value.

The other variables (`n`, `operations`, `x`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state, correcting the assumption to impact `y` instead of the undefined `final_y`, is:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n-1` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'
- `x` is an integer
- `y` is an integer incremented by 1 from its initial value, thus `y` is now `y + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n-1` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is `y + 1`.**
