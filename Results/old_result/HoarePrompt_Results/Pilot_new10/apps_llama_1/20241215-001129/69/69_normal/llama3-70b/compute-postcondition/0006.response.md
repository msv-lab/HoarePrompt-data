The code increments the value of `uy` by 1. The previous value of `uy` was 0, so the new value of `uy` is 1.

The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still an input integer, `ops` is still a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are still input integers, `ux` is still 0, `lx` is still 0, `ly` is still 0, and the value of `op` is still 'U'.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is 0, `uy` is 1, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, and `op` is 'U'**
