Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R`. If the last operation `op` is 'U', then `x` remains an integer from the previous operation, and `y` is incremented by 1 to `y + 1`. If the last operation `op` is 'D', then `y` is decreased by 1 from its previous value. If the last operation `op` is 'L', then `x` is decreased by 1 from its previous value. If the last operation `op` is 'R', then `x` is increased by 1 from its previous value.**
