The value of `final_x` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Note that the variable `final_x` is not defined in the initial state, but we can still update its value. However, we should note that `x` and `y` are defined as integers, but `final_x` is not. 

Since `final_x` is decreased by 1, it becomes `final_x - 1`. The value of `final_x` before the decrease is unknown, but we know that `x` is an integer and `y` is an integer. The value of `n` is a positive integer and `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n-1` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R'. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n-1` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n-1` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is `final_x - 1`**
