The code `dx += 1` increments the value of `dx` by 1. The previous value of `dx` was less than 0, so after the increment, `dx` will be one less than 0, which equals -1 + 1 = 0, but since `dx` was `x - ux` and initially was greater than or equal to 0, the new value of `dx` is now 0, which means `x - ux` equals 0. The other variables' states are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the net number of 'R' operations minus the net number of 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the net number of 'U' operations minus the net number of 'D' operations in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is 0, `dy` is `y - uy` and is greater than or equal to 0, `res` is 0, `op` is the first character in `ops` and equals 'L', and either `op` is not 'D' or `dy` is greater than or equal to 0, and either `op` is not 'U' or `dy` is 0, and either `op` is not 'R' or `dx` is less than or equal to 0, `x` equals `ux`.**
