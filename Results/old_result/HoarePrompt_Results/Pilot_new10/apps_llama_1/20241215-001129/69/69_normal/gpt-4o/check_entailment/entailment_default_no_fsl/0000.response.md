Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. 

The main issue with the code is that it only checks if the target position is revisited in the future operations, but it does not consider the case where the initial position needs to be changed to reach the target position.

For example, if the target position is (1, 1) and the operations are "RDU", the robot will end up at (0, 0). The code will not be able to find a solution because it does not consider changing the initial operations to reach the target position.

Another issue with the code is that it calculates the minimum length of the subsegment to be changed as the minimum distance between revisits to any position that is dx and dy away from the current position. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual operations that need to be changed to reach the target position.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be modified to consider all possible subsegments of operations and check if changing those subsegments can lead to the target position. This can be done by iterating over all possible start and end indices of the subsegment and checking if changing the operations within that subsegment can reach the target position.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
4
RDUU
1 1
```
The program will output -1, but the correct output should be a minimum length of subsegment that can be changed to reach the target position (1, 1). 

The program does not provide the correct output because it does not consider changing the initial operations to reach the target position. 

In summary, the code provided does not correctly solve the problem as described, and there are cases where it does not work correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the code is False.
