You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
operations = input().strip()
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, operations, x, y)
print(result)

def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:
        if op == 'U':
            final_y += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            final_y -= 1
        elif op == 'L':
            final_x -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            final_x += 1
    dx = x - final_x
    dy = y - final_y
    if dx == 0 and dy == 0:
        return 0
    min_length = float('inf')
    current_x = 0
    current_y = 0
    position_map = {(0, 0): -1}
    for i in range(n):
        if operations[i] == 'U':
            current_y += 1
        elif operations[i] == 'D':
            current_y -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'L':
            current_x -= 1
        elif operations[i] == 'R':
            current_x += 1
        target_pos = (current_x + dx, current_y + dy)
        if target_pos in position_map:
            min_length = min(min_length, i - position_map[target_pos])
        position_map[current_x, current_y] = i
    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the way it updates the position map and checks for the target position. 

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the target position is not directly reachable from the current position by changing a subsegment of the operations. The program only checks if the target position is in the position map, but it does not consider the case where the target position can be reached by changing a subsegment of the operations that does not include the current position.

Another issue is that the program does not handle the case where the target position is reachable from the initial position (0, 0) without changing any operations, but the program still needs to change some operations to reach the target position because the sequence of operations does not lead to the target position. 

For example, consider the input:

```
5
RURUU
-2 3
```

The program returns 3, which is correct, but this is more by chance than by design. A proper implementation should correctly handle all possible cases and return the correct minimum length of subsegment that can be changed. 

To correctly solve the problem, we would need to use a more sophisticated approach, such as dynamic programming or a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm, to find the minimum length of subsegment that can be changed to reach the target position. 

Here's a suggested approach to solve the problem correctly:
- Initialize the initial state of the robot (0, 0) and the target state (x, y).
- Use BFS to explore all possible states and keep track of the minimum length of subsegment that can be changed to reach each state.
- If the target state is reachable, return the minimum length of subsegment that can be changed to reach it.
- If the target state is not reachable, return -1.

Here is a simple example of how the algorithm could be implemented in Python:
```python
from collections import deque

def func_1(n, operations, x, y):
    def bfs():
        queue = deque([(0, 0, 0, [])])
        visited = set((0, 0, 0))
        while queue:
            current_x, current_y, length, changed = queue.popleft()
            if (current_x, current_y) == (x, y):
                return length
            for i, op in enumerate(operations):
                new_x, new_y = current_x, current_y
                if op == 'U':
                    new_y += 1
                elif op == 'D':
                    new_y -= 1
                elif op == 'L':
                    new_x -= 1
                elif op == 'R':
                    new_x += 1
                new_length = length + (i not in changed)
                if (new_x, new_y, new_length) not in visited:
                    visited.add((new_x, new_y, new_length))
                    queue.append((new_x, new_y, new_length, changed | {i}))
        return -1

    return bfs()

n = int(input())
operations = input().strip()
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, operations, x, y)
print(result)
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
operations = input().strip()
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
result = func_1(n, operations, x, y)
print(result)

    final_x = 0
    final_y = 0
    for op in operations:

    return min_length if min_length != float('inf') else -1
    #The program returns the minimum distance between revisits to any position if such revisits occur, otherwise it returns -1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n`, a string of operations, and integers `x` and `y`, and returns 0 if the target position is the final position after all operations, or the minimum distance between revisits to any position that is `dx` and `dy` away from the current position if such revisits occur, otherwise returns -1, handling all potential edge cases including non-revisitable positions and initial positions.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
