The code `uy -= 1` decreases the value of `uy` by 1. Given that the initial value of `uy` is 0, the new value of `uy` will be -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 1 character, `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is 0, `uy` is -1, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, the first character `op` in `ops` is not 'U', it is either 'D', 'L', or 'R', and the current value of `op` is 'D'**
