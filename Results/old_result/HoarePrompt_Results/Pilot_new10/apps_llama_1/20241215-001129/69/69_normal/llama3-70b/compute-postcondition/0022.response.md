To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters.
- `x` and `y` are input integers.

The given code is:
```python
uy -= 1
```

However, there seems to be a typo or misunderstanding in the given code. The variable `uy` is not defined in the initial state, but based on the context, it seems like it might be referring to the variable `y`. If we assume `uy` was meant to be `y`, the code would then correctly reference an existing variable.

Assuming the code is meant to be `y -= 1`, the impact on the program would be:

- The value of `y` is decremented by 1.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `ops`, `x`) are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is decremented by 1 from its original input integer value, so `y` is now `y - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R' and must have at least 2 characters, `x` is an input integer, and `y` is `y - 1`.**
