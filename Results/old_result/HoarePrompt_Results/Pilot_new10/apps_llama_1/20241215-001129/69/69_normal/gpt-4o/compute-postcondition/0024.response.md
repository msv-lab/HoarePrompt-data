Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length at least `n-1` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `y` is an integer. If the current operation `op` is 'L', then `final_x` is `final_x - 1`. If `op` is 'R', then `x` is incremented by 1. If `op` is neither 'L' nor 'R', the state of `x` remains unchanged.***
