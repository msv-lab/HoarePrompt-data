You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has got a robot which is situated on an infinite Cartesian plane, initially in the cell $(0, 0)$. Robot can perform the following four kinds of operations:   U — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y + 1)$;  D — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x, y - 1)$;  L — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x - 1, y)$;  R — move from $(x, y)$ to $(x + 1, y)$. 

Vasya also has got a sequence of $n$ operations. Vasya wants to modify this sequence so after performing it the robot will end up in $(x, y)$.

Vasya wants to change the sequence so the length of changed subsegment is minimum possible. This length can be calculated as follows: $maxID - minID + 1$, where $maxID$ is the maximum index of a changed operation, and $minID$ is the minimum index of a changed operation. For example, if Vasya changes RRRRRRR to RLRRLRL, then the operations with indices $2$, $5$ and $7$ are changed, so the length of changed subsegment is $7 - 2 + 1 = 6$. Another example: if Vasya changes DDDD to DDRD, then the length of changed subsegment is $1$. 

If there are no changes, then the length of changed subsegment is $0$. Changing an operation means replacing it with some operation (possibly the same); Vasya can't insert new operations into the sequence or remove them.

Help Vasya! Tell him the minimum length of subsegment that he needs to change so that the robot will go from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$, or tell him that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer number $n~(1 \le n \le 2 \cdot 10^5)$ — the number of operations.

The second line contains the sequence of operations — a string of $n$ characters. Each character is either U, D, L or R.

The third line contains two integers $x, y~(-10^9 \le x, y \le 10^9)$ — the coordinates of the cell where the robot should end its path.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the minimum possible length of subsegment that can be changed so the resulting sequence of operations moves the robot from $(0, 0)$ to $(x, y)$. If this change is impossible, print $-1$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
RURUU
-2 3

Output
3

Input
4
RULR
1 1

Output
0

Input
3
UUU
100 100

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example the sequence can be changed to LULUU. So the length of the changed subsegment is $3 - 1 + 1 = 3$.

In the second example the given sequence already leads the robot to $(x, y)$, so the length of the changed subsegment is $0$.

In the third example the robot can't end his path in the cell $(x, y)$.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ops = input()
    (x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    (ux, uy, lx, ly) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1
    (dx, dy) = (x - ux, y - uy)
    if dx < 0 or dy < 0:
        print(-1)
    else:
        res = 0
        for op in ops:
            if op == 'U' and dy > 0:
                dy -= 1
            elif op == 'D' and dy < 0:
                dy += 1
            elif op == 'R' and dx > 0:
                dx -= 1
            elif op == 'L' and dx < 0:
                dx += 1
            else:
                res += 1
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem. It attempts to calculate the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed, but it does not consider all possible cases. 

One case where the program fails is when the target position is not directly attainable by changing a single operation or a subsegment. The program only checks if the target position can be reached by changing operations in the sequence, but it does not consider the optimal way to change the sequence. 

For example, if the input is:
```
6
RRRRRR
2 2
```
The program will output `0` because the robot is already at the target position, but the correct output should be `0` as well because no changes are needed. However, if the input is:
```
6
RRRRUU
2 2
```
The program may not produce the correct output because it does not correctly calculate the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed.

The program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed. This can be done by iterating over all possible subsegments of the sequence and checking if changing each subsegment can lead to the target position. 

Here is a revised version of the code that correctly solves the problem:
```python
def min_length_subsegment(n, ops, x, y):
    ux, uy = 0, 0
    for op in ops:
        if op == 'U':
            uy += 1
        elif op == 'D':
            uy -= 1
        elif op == 'R':
            ux += 1
        elif op == 'L':
            ux -= 1

    if ux == x and uy == y:
        return 0

    min_length = float('inf')
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            new_ops = list(ops)
            new_ux, new_uy = ux, uy
            dx, dy = x - new_ux, y - new_uy

            for k in range(i, j + 1):
                if dx > 0:
                    new_ops[k] = 'R'
                    new_ux += 1
                    dx -= 1
                elif dx < 0:
                    new_ops[k] = 'L'
                    new_ux -= 1
                    dx += 1
                elif dy > 0:
                    new_ops[k] = 'U'
                    new_uy += 1
                    dy -= 1
                elif dy < 0:
                    new_ops[k] = 'D'
                    new_uy -= 1
                    dy += 1

                if new_ux == x and new_uy == y:
                    min_length = min(min_length, j - i + 1)
                    break

    if min_length == float('inf'):
        return -1

    return min_length

n = int(input())
ops = input()
x, y = map(int, input().split())
print(min_length_subsegment(n, ops, x, y))
```
This revised code correctly calculates the minimum length of the subsegment that needs to be changed by iterating over all possible subsegments and checking if changing each subsegment can lead to the target position.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts input from the user, including the number of operations `n`, a string of `n` operations where each operation is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', and two integers `x` and `y`. It calculates the net movement in the x and y directions based on the operations and checks if the destination (`x`, `y`) is reachable. If the destination is not reachable, it returns `-1`. Otherwise, it returns the number of operations that cannot be performed without overshooting the destination. The function assumes that the input is provided in the correct format and does not handle cases where the input is invalid or where the net movement is very large. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
