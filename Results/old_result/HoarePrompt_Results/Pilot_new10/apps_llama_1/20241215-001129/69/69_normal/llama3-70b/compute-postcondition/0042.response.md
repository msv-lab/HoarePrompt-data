Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `ops` is a string of `n` characters where each character is either 'U', 'D', 'L', or 'R', `x` and `y` are input integers, `ux` is the net number of 'R' operations minus the net number of 'L' operations in `ops`, `uy` is the net number of 'U' operations minus the net number of 'D' operations in `ops`, `lx` is 0, `ly` is 0, `dx` is `x - ux`, `dy` is `y - uy`, and both `dx` and `dy` are greater than or equal to 0**
