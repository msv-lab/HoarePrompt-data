The value of `final_x` is decreased by 1. The initial value of `final_x` is 0, so the new value of `final_x` is -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is -1, `final_y` is 0, the first character in `operations` is `op`, the current value of `op` is 'L'.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `operations` is a non-empty string of length `n` containing only the characters 'U', 'D', 'L', 'R', `x` is an integer, `y` is an integer, `final_x` is -1, `final_y` is 0, the first character in `operations` is `op`, the current value of `op` is 'L'**
