You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Recently Vasya found a golden ticket — a sequence which consists of $n$ digits $a_1a_2\dots a_n$. Vasya considers a ticket to be lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. For example, ticket $350178$ is lucky since it can be divided into three segments $350$, $17$ and $8$: $3+5+0=1+7=8$. Note that each digit of sequence should belong to exactly one segment.

Help Vasya! Tell him if the golden ticket he found is lucky or not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($2 \le n \le 100$) — the number of digits in the ticket.

The second line contains $n$ digits $a_1 a_2 \dots a_n$ ($0 \le a_i \le 9$) — the golden ticket. Digits are printed without spaces.


-----Output-----

If the golden ticket is lucky then print "YES", otherwise print "NO" (both case insensitive).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
73452

Output
YES

Input
4
1248

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example the ticket can be divided into $7$, $34$ and $52$: $7=3+4=5+2$.

In the second example it is impossible to divide ticket into segments with equal sum.
Program:
```
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

def func_1(n, ticket):

    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        current_sum = 0
        segment_count = 0
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'

def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum((int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the logic to check if the golden ticket can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. 

One issue is that the function `func_1` only checks for segments of a fixed length, but it should check for segments of any length. For example, if the input is "12312", the program will not correctly identify that this ticket can be divided into segments "12" and "312", both with sum 3.

Another issue is that the `segment_sum` function uses the global variable `ticket`, which is not a good practice. It would be better to pass the `ticket` as an argument to the `segment_sum` function.

To correctly solve this problem, the function should try all possible segmentations of the ticket and check if the sum of the digits in each segment is equal. 

For instance, the program fails when the input is "11112" because it can be divided into segments with equal sums: "1+1+1" = 3, "1+2" = 3. But the function `func_1` does not consider this segmentation. 

Therefore, the given program does not work correctly for all potential cases and its correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
n = int(input())
ticket = input()
print(func_1(n, ticket))

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer greater than 1, and ticket is a string of n digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10.
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        target_sum = segment_sum(0, segment_length - 1)
        
        current_sum = 0
        
        segment_count = 0
        
        for i in range(n):
            current_sum += int(ticket[i])
            if current_sum == target_sum:
                current_sum = 0
                segment_count += 1
        
        if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
            return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is the original non-negative integer greater than 1, `ticket` is the original string of `n` digits, `segment_length` is `n-1`, `target_sum` is the sum of the first `n-1` digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is the sum of the last sequence of digits not equal to `target_sum` or 0 if the last sequence equals `target_sum`, `segment_count` is the number of sequences of digits that sum up to `target_sum`, and `i` is `n`.
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: start and end are non-negative integers such that 0 <= start <= end < len(ticket), where ticket is a string of digits
def segment_sum(start, end):
    return sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits in the string 'ticket' from index 'start' to 'end' (inclusive), where 'start' and 'end' are non-negative integers and 0 <= start <= end < len(ticket)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
