Correctness: **False**

The code does not do what the problem description says for every potential case. The issue lies in the `func_1` function where it only checks for segment lengths up to `n-1` and it only considers the sum of the first segment as the target sum. However, the problem statement does not restrict the segment length to be less than `n`, and it also does not specify that the sum of the first segment must be the target sum. 

For example, consider the input `n = 3` and `ticket = "111"`. The function will return `'NO'` because it only checks for segment lengths of `1` and `2`, but it should return `'YES'` because the ticket can be divided into three segments of equal sum, each segment being a single digit.

Another issue is that the function `segment_sum` is not correctly implemented as it uses the global variable `ticket` instead of taking it as a parameter. This will cause incorrect results if the function is called with a different ticket.

To fix these issues, the function `func_1` should be modified to check all possible segment lengths and sums, and the function `segment_sum` should be modified to take the ticket as a parameter. 

Here is an example of how the corrected code could look:

```python
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        for start in range(n - segment_length + 1):
            target_sum = sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, start + segment_length))
            current_sum = 0
            segment_count = 0
            for i in range(n):
                current_sum += int(ticket[i])
                if current_sum == target_sum:
                    current_sum = 0
                    segment_count += 1
            if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
                return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

This corrected code still has issues and does not correctly solve the problem. A more correct solution would involve checking all possible ways to divide the ticket into segments and checking if the sum of the segments is equal. 

Here is an example of a more correct solution:

```python
def func_1(n, ticket):
    def is_lucky(ticket, segments):
        segment_sums = []
        for start, end in segments:
            segment_sum = sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, end + 1))
            segment_sums.append(segment_sum)
        return len(set(segment_sums)) == 1

    for i in range(1, 2**n):
        segments = []
        start = 0
        for j in range(n):
            if (i >> j) & 1:
                segments.append((start, j))
                start = j + 1
        if start < n:
            segments.append((start, n - 1))
        if len(segments) > 1 and is_lucky(ticket, segments):
            return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```
