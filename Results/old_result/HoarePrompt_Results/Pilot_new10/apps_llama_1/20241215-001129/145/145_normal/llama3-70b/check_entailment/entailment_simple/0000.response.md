Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description for several reasons:

1. The program only checks if the total sum of the digits in the ticket can be divided into two equal parts. It does not consider the possibility of dividing the ticket into more than two segments with equal sums.

2. The program uses a simple iterative approach to check if the ticket can be divided into segments with equal sums. However, this approach is not sufficient to handle all possible cases. For example, it does not consider the case where the ticket can be divided into three segments with equal sums, such as the example given in the problem description (350, 17, and 8).

3. The program returns True if there are at least two segments in the ticket that sum up to half of the total sum. However, this is not a correct condition to check if the ticket is lucky. A ticket is lucky if it can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums, not necessarily with sums equal to half of the total sum.

Here's a case where the program does not follow the problem description:

Input:
6
350178

The program will return False because it cannot divide the ticket into two segments with equal sums. However, the ticket can be divided into three segments with equal sums (350, 17, and 8), making it a lucky ticket according to the problem description.

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to check all possible segmentations of the ticket and verify if any of them result in two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. This can be achieved using a more complex algorithm, such as dynamic programming or recursion. 

Here's an example of how the corrected function could look like:

```python
def func_1(ticket):
    total_sum = sum(ticket)
    for target_sum in range(1, total_sum):
        segments = 0
        curr_sum = 0
        for digit in ticket:
            curr_sum += digit
            if curr_sum == target_sum:
                segments += 1
                curr_sum = 0
        if curr_sum == 0 and segments >= 2:
            return True
    return False
```

This function checks all possible target sums and returns True as soon as it finds a sum that results in two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums. If no such sum is found, it returns False.
