The value of `current_sum` is reset to 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0]) + int(ticket[1])`, `current_sum` is 0, and `segment_count` is the number of complete segments found in `ticket` where the sum of digits equals `target_sum`.
