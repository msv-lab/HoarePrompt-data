The code resets the value of `curr_sum` to 0. The previous value of `curr_sum` was equal to `target_sum`, but this change does not affect `target_sum`. The other variables (`ticket`, `total_sum`, `target_sum`, `segments`, `digit`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`ticket` is a non-empty string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9', `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and is even, `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2`, `curr_sum` is 0, `segments` is 1, `digit` is the first digit in `ticket` with its integer value equal to `target_sum`.**
