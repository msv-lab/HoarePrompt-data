According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 3, `i` is 0 (in both cases, whether `current_sum` equals `target_sum` or not), so for the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1. 
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 3, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is the current sum, `segment_count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1**
