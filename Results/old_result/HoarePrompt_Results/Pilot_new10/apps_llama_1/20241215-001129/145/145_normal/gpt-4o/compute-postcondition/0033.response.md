Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 2, `target_sum` is `int(ticket[0]) + int(ticket[1])`. If `current_sum` equals `target_sum`, then `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is 1, and `i` is 0. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them.**
