The code assigns the value of `total_sum // 2` to `target_sum`. Since `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket` and it is even, `total_sum // 2` will be an integer. The value of `target_sum` is equal to half of `total_sum`. The states of the other variables, `ticket` and `total_sum`, are not affected. 

Output State: **`ticket` is a string of digits where each digit is between '0' and '9', `total_sum` is the sum of the digits in `ticket`, `total_sum` is even, and `target_sum` is `total_sum // 2` or half of `total_sum`**
