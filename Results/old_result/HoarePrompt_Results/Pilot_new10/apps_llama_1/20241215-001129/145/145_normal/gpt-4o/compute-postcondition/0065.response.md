The code resets `current_sum` to 0. The previous value of `current_sum` was `current_sum` + `int(ticket[2])`, but this is no longer relevant as it is overwritten. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 3, `ticket` is a string of `n` digits where each digit is a non-negative integer less than 10, `segment_length` is 3, `target_sum` is the sum of the first three digits of `ticket`, `current_sum` is 0, `segment_count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2**
