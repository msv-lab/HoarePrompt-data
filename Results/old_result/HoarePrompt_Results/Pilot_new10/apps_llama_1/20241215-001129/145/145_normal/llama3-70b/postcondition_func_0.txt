The function accepts a string of digits, checks if the total sum of the digits is even, and if so, attempts to divide the string into segments summing up to half of the total sum, returning True if at least two such segments exist and False otherwise; if the total sum is odd, it immediately returns False, but it does not handle cases of non-string inputs or strings containing non-digit characters.
