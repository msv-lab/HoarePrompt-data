Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the `func_1` function, where the target sum is calculated as the sum of the first `segment_length` digits. However, this is not correct because the problem description states that the ticket can be divided into two or more non-intersecting segments with equal sums, but it does not specify that the first segment must be of length `segment_length`.

A correct implementation would involve trying all possible segment lengths and sums, not just the sum of the first `segment_length` digits. The current implementation only checks if the ticket can be divided into segments of the same sum, where the first segment is of length `segment_length`, but it does not check all possible combinations of segment lengths and sums.

For example, consider the ticket "73452". The current implementation would check if the ticket can be divided into segments of sum 7, 73, 734, and 7345, but it would not check if the ticket can be divided into segments of sum 7, 34, and 52, which is a valid division according to the problem description.

To fix this issue, the program would need to be modified to try all possible segment lengths and sums, not just the sum of the first `segment_length` digits. This could be achieved by using a more complex algorithm that tries all possible combinations of segment lengths and sums, or by using a dynamic programming approach to solve the problem.

Here is a modified version of the code that fixes the issue:

```python
def func_1(n, ticket):
    for segment_length in range(1, n):
        for start in range(n - segment_length + 1):
            target_sum = sum(int(ticket[i]) for i in range(start, start + segment_length))
            current_sum = 0
            segment_count = 0
            i = 0
            while i < n:
                current_sum += int(ticket[i])
                if current_sum == target_sum:
                    current_sum = 0
                    segment_count += 1
                i += 1
            if current_sum == 0 and segment_count > 1:
                return 'YES'
    return 'NO'
```

This modified version of the code tries all possible segment lengths and sums, and checks if the ticket can be divided into segments of equal sum for each possible combination. If it finds a valid division, it returns 'YES'; otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
