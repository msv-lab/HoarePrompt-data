Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. The issue lies in the way the program checks for segments with equal sums. It only checks if the total sum of the ticket can be divided into two equal parts, which is not the condition for a ticket to be lucky.

A counterexample is the ticket "350178". The program should return "YES" because the ticket can be divided into segments with equal sums (3+5+0 = 1+7 = 8), but the program will return "NO" because the total sum of the ticket (3+5+0+1+7+8 = 24) cannot be divided into two equal parts.

The program should check all possible combinations of segments with equal sums, not just dividing the total sum into two equal parts. 

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to work correctly:
```python
def func_1(ticket):
    n = len(ticket)
    for segment_size in range(1, n):
        sums = []
        curr_sum = 0
        for i in range(n):
            curr_sum += ticket[i]
            if i % segment_size == segment_size - 1:
                sums.append(curr_sum)
                curr_sum = 0
        if len(sums) > 1 and len(set(sums)) == 1:
            return True
    return False
```
This modified program checks all possible segment sizes and returns "YES" if it finds a segment size that divides the ticket into segments with equal sums. If it doesn't find any such segment size, it returns "NO".
