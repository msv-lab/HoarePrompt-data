Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`. If `current_lcm` is less than the previous minimum LCM or if `current_lcm` equals the previous minimum LCM but `candidate` is less than the previous minimum `k`, then `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm` and `min_k` equals `candidate`.***
