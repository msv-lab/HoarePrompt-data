Correctness: **False**

The code provided attempts to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k` is the smallest possible. However, it only checks factors of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, which may not cover all possible cases. 

For instance, in the case where `a = 8` and `b = 12`, the optimal `k` is `4` because the LCM of `8+4` and `12+4` is `12`, but this is not a factor of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, which is `4`. However, upon closer inspection, it can be seen that the absolute difference between `8` and `12` is indeed `4`. 

However, the code does not properly handle cases where `a` and `b` share common factors. The current implementation does not consider cases where `k` is not a factor of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, but can still minimize the LCM.

A more significant issue arises when considering the brute-force approach and its relation to the mathematical properties being utilized. The correct approach should involve using the mathematical property that `lcm(a, b) * gcd(a, b) = a * b`, and leveraging this property to find the optimal `k`. 

In this context, the provided code, specifically `func_3(a, b)`, may not correctly find the smallest `k` to minimize the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k` in all cases. The function may not check for cases where the optimal `k` is greater than the square root of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, or when the optimal `k` does not divide the absolute difference. 

The code's approach has a narrow scope and might miss the optimal solution for certain inputs. Given the issue mentioned above, it's likely that the code does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 

Therefore, Correctness: **False** due to its failure to consider all potential cases and its narrow approach in finding the optimal `k`.
