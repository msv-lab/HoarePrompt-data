To determine the output state, let's analyze the impact of the given code snippet on the variables.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```
This line of code calculates a new value for `new_a` based on the values of `a` and `candidate`. The expression `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate` effectively rounds up the value of `a` to the nearest multiple of `candidate`, and then this value is multiplied by `candidate` to ensure it is indeed a multiple of `candidate`.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`.
- `diff` is divisible by `k`.
- The condition for updating `min_lcm`, `min_k`, and the calculation of `candidate`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` are based on previous conditions and variable values.

The code only updates the value of `new_a`. The calculation for `new_a` depends on `a` and `candidate`, where `candidate` is one of the values from the list `[k, diff // k]`.

Since `candidate` can be either `k` or `diff // k`, and we know `diff` is divisible by `k`, the value of `new_a` will be the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`. This means `new_a` is now a multiple of `candidate`, which is either `k` or `diff // k`, and its value is determined by the formula provided.

The states of other variables (`a`, `b`, `diff`, `k`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `current_lcm`, `new_b`) are not directly affected by this line of code, but `new_a` has been updated based on `a` and `candidate`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0.
- `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`.
- `diff` is divisible by `k`.
- `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, where `candidate` is the other value from the list `[k, diff // k]`.
- The values of `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `current_lcm`, and `new_b` remain as they were before this operation, awaiting their potential update based on subsequent conditions or calculations.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, where `candidate` is the other value from the list `[k, diff // k]`.**
