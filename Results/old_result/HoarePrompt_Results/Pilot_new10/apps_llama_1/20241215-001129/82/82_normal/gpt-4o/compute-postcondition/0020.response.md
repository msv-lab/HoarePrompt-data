The code assigns the value of `current_lcm` to `min_lcm`. The value of `current_lcm` is equal to `lcm(new_a, new_b)`, where `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` (or `diff`) that is greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` (or `diff`) that is greater than or equal to `b`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), 
`diff` is at least 1, 
`candidate` equals `diff`, 
`k` is 1, 
`new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, 
`new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` (or `diff`) that is greater than or equal to `b`, 
`current_lcm` equals `lcm(new_a, new_b)`, 
`min_lcm` equals `lcm(new_a, new_b)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is at least 1, `candidate` equals `diff`, `k` is 1, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` (or `diff`) that is greater than or equal to `b`, `current_lcm` equals `lcm(new_a, new_b)`, `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm` which is `lcm(new_a, new_b)`**
