The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers greater than or equal to 1. After executing the function body, the function returns the absolute value of the original 'a', which is the GCD of the original 'a' and 'b' where 'b' is 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the absolute value of `a` as the GCD when `b` is 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, returns the absolute value of a as the GCD when b is 0.**
