Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is divisible by `k`, if `current_lcm` < `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` == `min_lcm` and `candidate` < `min_k`), then `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm`, `min_k` equals `candidate`, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.***
