Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to implement the correct logic to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple of `a+k` and `b+k` is the smallest possible. 

Function `func_1(a, b)` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, and function `func_2(a, b)` uses this GCD to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers.

The main code iterates through possible values of `k`, starting from 0 and increasing by 1, and checks if the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k` is less than the current minimum LCM. If it is, the code updates the minimum LCM and continues to the next value of `k`. If the LCM is not less than the current minimum, the code breaks the loop and prints the previous value of `k`, which is the smallest `k` that results in the smallest possible LCM.

The provided examples also seem to be handled correctly by the code: for the input `6 10`, the output is `2`, which is correct because the LCM of `6+2` and `10+2` is `24`, which is the smallest possible LCM; for the input `21 31`, the output is `9`, which is also correct; and for the input `5 10`, the output is `0`, which is correct because the LCM of `5` and `10` is `10`, which is the smallest possible LCM.

The hints for functions `func_1` and `func_2` agree with the code, and there are no obvious cases where the code does not follow the problem description. Therefore, it appears that the code is correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem.
