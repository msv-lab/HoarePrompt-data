The given code snippet is `new_b = (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. This code calculates the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`.

`new_b` is assigned the value of `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, where `candidate` equals `diff // k`, and `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, so `a`, `b`, `diff`, `candidate`, `k`, `new_a`, and `current_lcm` remain the same.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, 
`diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, 
`candidate` equals `diff // k`, 
`k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, 
`new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, 
`new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, 
`current_lcm` equals the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`. If `current_lcm` is less than the previous minimum LCM or if `current_lcm` equals the previous minimum LCM but `candidate` is less than the previous minimum `k`, then `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm` and `min_k` equals `candidate`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `candidate` equals `diff // k`, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`**
