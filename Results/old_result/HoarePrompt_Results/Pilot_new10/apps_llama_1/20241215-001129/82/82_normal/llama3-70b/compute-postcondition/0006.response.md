To determine the final output state of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop's operation.

The loop operates as follows:
```
while b:
    a, b = b, a % b
```
This is essentially the Euclidean algorithm for finding the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers.

Given the output states after the loop executes some number of times:
- After 1 time: `a` equals the initial `b`, `b` equals the remainder of the initial `a` divided by the initial `b`.
- After 2 times and more: `a` equals the initial value of `b`, `b` is 0.

However, these descriptions don't fully capture the essence of what the algorithm does. Let's correct the understanding:

- The loop continues as long as `b` is not 0.
- In each iteration, `a` becomes the old `b`, and `b` becomes the remainder of the old `a` divided by the old `b`.
- This process repeats until `b` is 0.

When `b` becomes 0, `a` will hold the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, because that's what the Euclidean algorithm does. It finds the GCD by successively replacing `a` and `b` with `b` and the remainder of `a` divided by `b`, until `b` is 0. At that point, `a` is the GCD.

Therefore, the final output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is that `a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is the GCD of the original `a` and `b`, `b` is 0**
