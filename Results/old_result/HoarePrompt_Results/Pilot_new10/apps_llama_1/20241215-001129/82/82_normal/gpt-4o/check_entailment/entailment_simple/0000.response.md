Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description. It calculates the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k` is the smallest possible.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The `func_1` function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `x` and `y`. This is a standard algorithm for calculating GCD.
2. The `func_2` function calculates the LCM of two numbers `x` and `y` using the formula `LCM(x, y) = (x * y) / GCD(x, y)`.
3. The `func_3` function is the main function that calculates the smallest `k`. It first checks if `a` and `b` are equal, in which case it returns `0` because `k` can be `0`.
4. If `a` and `b` are not equal, it calculates the absolute difference `diff` between `a` and `b`.
5. The function then iterates over all factors `k` of `diff` (up to the square root of `diff`) and checks if `k` can be used to minimize the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k`.
6. For each factor `k`, it calculates the new values of `a` and `b` (`new_a` and `new_b`) such that `new_a` and `new_b` are the smallest multiples of `k` that are greater than or equal to `a` and `b`, respectively.
7. It then calculates the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` using the `func_2` function and checks if this LCM is smaller than the current minimum LCM.
8. If it finds a smaller LCM, it updates the minimum LCM and the corresponding `k` value.
9. Finally, it returns the `k` value that results in the smallest LCM.

The program covers all possible cases because it iterates over all factors of the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and checks each factor as a potential `k` value. The use of `float('inf')` to initialize `min_lcm` ensures that the first calculated LCM will always be smaller, and the use of `candidate < min_k` in the condition ensures that if multiple `k` values result in the same minimum LCM, the smallest `k` value is chosen.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and will always find the smallest non-negative integer `k` that minimizes the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k`.
