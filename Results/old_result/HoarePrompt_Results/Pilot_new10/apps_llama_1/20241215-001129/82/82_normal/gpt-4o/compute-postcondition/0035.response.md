The value of `new_b` is calculated as the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`. This is achieved by adding `candidate - 1` to `b`, then dividing by `candidate` and rounding down (using integer division `//`), and finally multiplying by `candidate`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `min_lcm` is the smallest achievable LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` for any candidate factor of `diff`, `min_k` is the factor of `diff` that yields `min_lcm`, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `b`, which equals to `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `min_lcm` is the smallest achievable LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` for any candidate factor of `diff`, `min_k` is the factor of `diff` that yields `min_lcm`, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`**
