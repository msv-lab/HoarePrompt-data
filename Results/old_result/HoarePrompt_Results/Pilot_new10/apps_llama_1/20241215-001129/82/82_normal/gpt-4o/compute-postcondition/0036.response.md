The value of `current_lcm` is assigned the result of the function `func_2` applied to `new_a` and `new_b`. The pre-condition states that `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, and `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `min_lcm` is the smallest achievable LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` for any candidate factor of `diff`, `min_k` is the factor of `diff` that yields `min_lcm`, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` as calculated by `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `min_lcm` is the smallest achievable LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` for any candidate factor of `diff`, `min_k` is the factor of `diff` that yields `min_lcm`, `candidate` is either `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the nearest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is `func_2(new_a, new_b)`**
