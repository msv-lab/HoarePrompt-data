The code introduces a new variable `min_lcm` and assigns it a value of positive infinity. The values of `a`, `b`, and `diff` are not affected by this assignment.

The value of `min_lcm` is set to `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity in Python. The values of `a` and `b` remain positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`. The value of `diff` remains a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`; `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`; `min_lcm` is positive infinity**
