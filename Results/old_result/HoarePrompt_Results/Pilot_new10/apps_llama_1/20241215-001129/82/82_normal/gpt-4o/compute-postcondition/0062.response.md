Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, `diff` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `k`, `k` is 2, `candidate` is `k` or `diff // k`, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. The current value of `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm`, or the current value of `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and the current value of `candidate` is less than `min_k`.**
