According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k` and `diff`. If `k` is less than or equal to the square root of `diff`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is some value in the range, and `diff` is the difference between `a` and `b`. For the loop to execute again, `k` must be increased by 1. 

State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, if `diff` is divisible by `k`, then `min_lcm` is the smallest achievable LCM of `new_a` and `new_b` for any candidate factor of `diff`, and `min_k` is the factor of `diff` that yields `min_lcm`.**
