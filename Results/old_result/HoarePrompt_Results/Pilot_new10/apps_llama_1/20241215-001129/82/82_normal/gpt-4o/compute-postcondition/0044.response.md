The value of `current_lcm` is assigned the result of the function `func_2` with arguments `new_a` and `new_b`. The values of `new_a` and `new_b` are calculated based on `a`, `b`, and `candidate`. However, the code provided does not specify the values of `candidate`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, `new_a` and `new_b` are also integers and are calculated as the smallest multiple of `candidate` greater than or equal to `a` and `b` respectively. 

Given the initial conditions that `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is divisible by `k`, the state of these variables is unchanged as the provided code only updates `current_lcm`. 

However, without knowing the definition of `func_2`, we cannot directly calculate `current_lcm`. Assuming `func_2` calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers, `current_lcm` will be the LCM of `new_a` and `new_b`. 

Therefore, considering `a`, `b`, `diff`, and `k` are not modified, and assuming `func_2` calculates the LCM, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` equals the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `diff` is divisible by `k`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` equals the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b`.**
