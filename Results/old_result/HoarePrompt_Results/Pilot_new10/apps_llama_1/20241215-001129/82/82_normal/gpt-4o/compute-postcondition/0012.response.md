Postcondition: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1 and a multiple of `k`, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` is `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`. The current value of `current_lcm` is less than the current value of `min_lcm`, or the current value of `current_lcm` is equal to the current value of `min_lcm` and the current value of `candidate` is less than the current value of `min_k`.**
