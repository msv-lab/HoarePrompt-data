Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the solution to the problem described. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works:

- The code initializes `k` to 0, and `min_lcm` to the least common multiple (LCM) of `a` and `b`. The LCM is calculated using the function `func_2`, which is based on the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)`. 

- The `while` loop then iterates through increasing values of `k`, updating `min_lcm` whenever a smaller LCM is found. The loop breaks when no smaller LCM can be found.

- Finally, the code prints the smallest `k` that resulted in the smallest LCM. Since the loop breaks as soon as a larger LCM is found, this `k` will always be the smallest possible.

The `func_1` and `func_2` functions provided also work as expected: `func_1` uses the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, and `func_2` uses this GCD to calculate the LCM.

The code works correctly for all potential cases because it exhaustively searches for the smallest `k` that minimizes the LCM, and its calculation of LCM is based on a well-established formula. The examples provided in the problem statement are also correctly handled by this code.

One potential issue could be integer overflow for very large inputs, but this is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description as a concern, and the given constraints on `a` and `b` minimize this risk. 

The provided output hints, which mention the GCD calculation and LCM calculation, agree with the code and support its correctness. 

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, the code works as expected for every potential case, and the Correctness is **True**.
