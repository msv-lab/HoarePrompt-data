Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is at least 1, `candidate` equals `diff`, `k` is 1, `new_a` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`, `new_b` is the smallest multiple of `candidate` (or `diff`) that is greater than or equal to `b`, and `current_lcm` equals `lcm(new_a, new_b)`. If `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or `current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`, then `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm` and `min_k` equals `candidate` (or `diff`), otherwise the values of `min_lcm` and `min_k` remain unchanged***
