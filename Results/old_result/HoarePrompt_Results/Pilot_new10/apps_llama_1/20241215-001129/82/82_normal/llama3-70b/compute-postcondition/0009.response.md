The function func_1 accepts two parameters, a and b, which are positive integers greater than or equal to 1. The function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b. The while loop continues until b becomes 0, at which point a contains the GCD of the original a and b. 

However, the annotations and return postconditions seem to be incorrect as they state that the function returns the absolute value of the original 'a', which is not the case. The function actually returns the GCD of the original 'a' and 'b', not the absolute value of 'a'. 

Additionally, the annotations do not consider the case where the inputs are not positive integers greater than or equal to 1, or where the inputs are equal to 1. The code does not handle these edge cases explicitly.

The correct functionality of the function, based on the code, is to calculate the GCD of two positive integers a and b using the Euclidean algorithm.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, and returns the GCD. **
