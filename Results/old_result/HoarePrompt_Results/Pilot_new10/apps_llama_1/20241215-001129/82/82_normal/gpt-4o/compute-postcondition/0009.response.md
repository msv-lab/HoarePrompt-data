To calculate the new state, let's analyze the given code:

```python
new_a = (a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate
```

This line of code calculates a new value for `a` (named `new_a`) by rounding up `a` to the nearest multiple of `candidate`. 

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`.
- `diff` is at least 1 and a multiple of `k`.
- `min_lcm` is positive infinity.
- `min_k` is 0.
- `k` is 1.
- The loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]`.

The introduction of `new_a` does not change the values of `a`, `b`, `diff`, `min_lcm`, `min_k`, or `k`. It introduces a new variable `new_a` which is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`.

The value of `candidate` is not directly provided, but since the loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]`, we can infer that `candidate` takes values within this range. Given `k` is 1, `candidate` could be any integer from 1 to `diff`.

The calculation of `new_a` depends on `a` and `candidate`. For any given `candidate`, `new_a` will be the smallest multiple of `candidate` that is greater than or equal to `a`.

Thus, the output state, considering the introduction of `new_a` and no changes to the other variables, is:

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1 and a multiple of `k`, `min_lcm` is positive infinity, `min_k` is 0, `k` is 1, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and the loop iterates over `[k, diff // k]`.**
