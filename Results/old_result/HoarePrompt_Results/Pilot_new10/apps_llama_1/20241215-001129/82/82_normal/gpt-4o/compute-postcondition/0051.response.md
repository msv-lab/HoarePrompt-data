The value of `current_lcm` is updated to the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`, where `func_2` presumably calculates the least common multiple of two numbers. 

Since `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` and `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, the least common multiple of `new_a` and `new_b` is equal to the least common multiple of `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate` and `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`. 

However, we don't have the definition of `func_2`, but based on the context, it's safe to assume that `func_2` calculates the least common multiple correctly.

Other variables are not affected by the code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `candidate` equals `diff // k`, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals the result of `func_2(new_a, new_b)`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is a positive integer greater than 0, `candidate` equals `diff // k`, `k` is in the range from 2 to `int(math.sqrt(diff)) + 1`, `new_a` equals `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` equals `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals the result of `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`**
