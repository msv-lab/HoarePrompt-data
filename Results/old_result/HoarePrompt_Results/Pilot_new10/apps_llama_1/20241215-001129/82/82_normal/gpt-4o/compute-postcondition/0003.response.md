To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9, and `a` is not equal to `b`.

The code calculates the absolute difference between `a` and `b` and assigns it to the variable `diff`.

Given that `diff = abs(a - b)`, and knowing that `a` and `b` are positive integers where `a` is not equal to `b`, the value of `diff` will be a positive integer representing the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. This difference will also be less than or equal to 10^9 - 1 (since the maximum difference between two numbers in the range 1 to 10^9 occurs when one number is 1 and the other is 10^9, resulting in a difference of 10^9 - 1).

Therefore, the output state includes the fact that `a` and `b` remain positive integers with 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, and `diff` is a positive integer equal to the absolute difference between `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`; `diff` is a positive integer equal to `abs(a - b)`**
