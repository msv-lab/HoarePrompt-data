To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state is: `a` is equal to the initial value of `b`, and `b` must be non-zero.

The code is: `a, b = b, a % b`

This line of code simultaneously updates the values of `a` and `b`. After execution, `a` will be equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` will be equal to the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`.

Since `a` initially is equal to the initial value of `b`, we can say `a` equals `b` before the code execution. 

The new value of `b` is `a % b`, which is essentially `b % b` since `a` equals `b`. The remainder when any number is divided by itself is 0 (except for 0 itself, but `b` must be non-zero). 

So, after the code is executed, `a` will be equal to the original value of `b`, and `b` will be 0.

Output State: **`a` is equal to the original value of `b`, `b` is 0**
