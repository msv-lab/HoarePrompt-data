The program returns `min_k`, which is the factor of `diff` that results in `min_lcm`. `diff` is the absolute difference between the original `a` and `b`, where `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`. If `diff` is 1, then `min_k` is 0.

Output State: **The program returns min_k, which is the factor of the absolute difference between a and b, or 0 if the absolute difference is 1**
