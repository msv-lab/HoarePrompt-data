Correctness: **False**

The given code does not handle all potential cases correctly. The code is designed to find the smallest non-negative integer `k` such that the least common multiple (LCM) of `a+k` and `b+k` is the smallest possible. However, the code starts with `k = 0` and increments `k` until it finds a `k` where the LCM of `a+k` and `b+k` is greater than or equal to the minimum LCM found so far. 

The problem with this approach is that it only checks `k` values where the LCM is strictly decreasing. If the LCM is the same for multiple consecutive `k` values, the code will only consider the first one it encounters and will not continue to check for the smallest `k` that gives the same minimum LCM.

For example, consider the case where `a = 10` and `b = 10`. The code will output `0` as the answer, which is correct. However, if we consider the case where `a = 12` and `b = 24`, the code will output `0` as well, because the LCM of `12` and `24` is `24`, and adding `1` to both numbers results in an LCM of `39` which is larger. But in reality, adding `2` to both numbers results in an LCM of `26`, and adding `4` to both numbers results in an LCM of `32`, and adding `6` to both numbers results in an LCM of `24` again. So, the code should output `6`, but it doesn't.

This example demonstrates that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, the Correctness is **False**.
