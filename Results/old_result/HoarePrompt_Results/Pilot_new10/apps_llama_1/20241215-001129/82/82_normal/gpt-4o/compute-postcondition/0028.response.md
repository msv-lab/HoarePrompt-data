To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\),
- `diff` is at least 1,
- `candidate` equals `diff // 2`,
- `k` is 2,
- `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`,
- `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`,
- `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`,
- `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm`.

And the code to execute is:
```python
min_k = candidate
```

This line of code assigns the value of `candidate` to `min_k`. 

So, the value of `min_k` becomes `diff // 2`.

All other variables (`a`, `b`, `diff`, `candidate`, `k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, `current_lcm`, `min_lcm`) maintain their initial state values since they are not modified by the given code.

Therefore, the Output State is:
- `a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\),
- `diff` is at least 1,
- `candidate` equals `diff // 2`,
- `k` is 2,
- `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`,
- `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`,
- `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`,
- `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm`,
- `min_k` equals `diff // 2`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq a, b \leq 10^9\) and \(a \neq b\), `diff` is at least 1, `candidate` equals `diff // 2`, `k` is 2, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `current_lcm` equals `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`, `min_lcm` equals `current_lcm`, `min_k` equals `diff // 2`.**
