Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= 10^9 and `a` is not equal to `b`, `diff` is at least 1 and a multiple of `k`, if `current_lcm` is less than `min_lcm` or (`current_lcm` equals `min_lcm` and `candidate` is less than `min_k`), then `min_lcm` is updated to `current_lcm`, `min_k` is updated to `candidate`, `new_a` is `(a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, `new_b` is `(b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate`, and `current_lcm` is `func_2((a + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate, (b + candidate - 1) // candidate * candidate)`, otherwise `min_lcm`, `min_k`, `new_a`, `new_b`, and `current_lcm` retain their original values, `k` remains 1.***
