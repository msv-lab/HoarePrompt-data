The function `func_3` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are positive integers ranging from 1 to 10^9. After executing the function body, there are two possible return cases: 
Case_1: The function returns 0. 
Case_2: The function returns min_k, which is a factor of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, or 0 if the absolute difference is 1. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_3` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return either 0 or a factor of the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, unless the absolute difference is 1, in which case it also returns 0.
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integer parameters a and b, and returns either 0 or a factor of the absolute difference between a and b, unless the absolute difference is 1, in which case it also returns 0.**
