Correctness: **True** 

The given Python program appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. 

Here's why:

1. The program defines a function `func_1(a, b)` to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This function is implemented correctly.

2. The program defines another function `func_2(a, b)` to calculate the least common multiple (LCM) of two numbers `a` and `b` using the formula `lcm(a, b) = (a * b) / gcd(a, b)`. This function is also implemented correctly.

3. The program then iterates through possible values of `k`, starting from 0, and checks if the LCM of `a + k` and `b + k` is smaller than the current minimum LCM found so far. If it is, the program updates the minimum LCM and continues to the next value of `k`. If it's not, the program breaks out of the loop.

4. Once the loop breaks, the program prints the value of `k - 1`, which is the smallest non-negative integer `k` for which the LCM of `a + k` and `b + k` is the smallest possible.

The provided examples in the problem description seem to work correctly with this program, and no obvious edge cases have been overlooked. Therefore, the program appears to be correct for all potential cases. 

However, it's worth noting that this program may not be the most efficient solution for large inputs, as it uses a brute-force approach to find the smallest `k`. A more efficient solution might involve using mathematical properties of LCM and GCD to find the optimal `k` directly, rather than iterating through all possible values.
