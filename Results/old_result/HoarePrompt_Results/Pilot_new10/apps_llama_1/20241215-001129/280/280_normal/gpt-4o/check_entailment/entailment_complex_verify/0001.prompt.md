You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it doesn't consider the constraint that the absolute difference in speed between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed `d`. It only checks for this constraint when calculating the speed at each second, but it doesn't guarantee that the speed at the previous second plus `d` won't exceed `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. 

However, a more specific reason the code is incorrect is due to the line where it calculates the speed at each second: 

```python
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

This line of code assumes that the speed should always increase as much as possible, but it doesn't consider the case where `speeds[i - 1] - d` is greater than `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d` if `v1` is larger than `v2`. In this case, it should decrease the speed as much as possible instead of increasing it.

For example, if `v1` is 10, `v2` is 5, `t` is 3, and `d` is 3, the program will calculate the speeds as `[10, 13, 5]`, which is incorrect because the difference in speed between the first and second seconds exceeds `d`. 

The correct calculation should ensure that the speed at each second is within the allowed range and also doesn't exceed `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. 

Here is a correct version of the code:
```python
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t-1):
        speeds[i] = min(max(speeds[i - 1] - d, v2 - (t - i - 1) * d), speeds[i - 1] + d)
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)

func()
```
This version of the code correctly calculates the speed at each second, ensuring that it's within the allowed range and doesn't exceed `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. 

So in conclusion, because there is at least one potential case that the code does not work as expected then the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: v_1 and v_2 are integers such that 1 <= v_1, v_2 <= 100, t is an integer such that 2 <= t <= 100, and d is an integer such that 0 <= d <= 10.
def func():
    v1, v2 = map(int, input().split())
    t, d = map(int, input().split())
    speeds = [0] * t
    speeds[0] = v1
    speeds[-1] = v2
    for i in range(1, t):
        speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `v1` is the original input integer, `v2` is the original input integer, `t` is the original input integer, `d` is the original input integer, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, each subsequent element (except the last) is the minimum of the previous element plus `d` and `v2` plus `d` times the number of elements remaining after the current index, the last element is `v2`, and `i` is `t-1` if `t` is greater than 1, otherwise `i` remains undefined because the loop does not execute.
    total_distance = sum(speeds)
    print(total_distance)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads two initial and final speeds, time, and acceleration, calculates a list of speeds based on these inputs where each subsequent speed is the minimum of the previous speed plus acceleration and the final speed plus acceleration times the remaining time, and prints the total distance traveled by summing up these speeds.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
