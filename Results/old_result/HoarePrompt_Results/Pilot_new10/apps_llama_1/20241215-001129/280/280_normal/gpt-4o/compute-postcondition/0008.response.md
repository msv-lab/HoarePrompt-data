The given code updates the value of `speeds[i]`. Given that `i` is 2, `speeds[i]` refers to the third element in the `speeds` list. 

The new value of `speeds[i]` is the minimum of `speeds[i - 1] + d` and `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`. Since `i` is 2, `speeds[i - 1]` is the second element in the `speeds` list, which is the minimum of `v1 + d` and `v2 + (t - 2) * d`.

Substituting the value of `i` into the expression `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`, we get `v2 + (t - 2 - 1) * d = v2 + (t - 3) * d`. 

So, `speeds[2]` is updated to be the minimum of `speeds[1] + d` and `v2 + (t - 3) * d`. Since `speeds[1]` is the minimum of `v1 + d` and `v2 + (t - 2) * d`, `speeds[2]` is the minimum of the minimum of `v1 + d` and `v2 + (t - 2) * d` plus `d`, and `v2 + (t - 3) * d`. 

This simplifies to the minimum of `v1 + 2*d` and `v2 + (t - 2) * d + d`, and `v2 + (t - 3) * d`. Since `v2 + (t - 2) * d + d = v2 + (t - 1) * d`, `speeds[2]` is the minimum of `v1 + 2*d` and `v2 + (t - 3) * d` and `v2 + (t - 1) * d` is not considered but `v2 + (t - 1) * d` is larger than `v2 + (t - 3) * d`, and also larger than `v1 + 2*d` when t is large.

The other variables `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer and must be at least 3, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the second element is the minimum of `v1 + d` and `v2 + (t - 2) * d`, the third element is the minimum of `v1 + 2*d` and `v2 + (t - 3) * d`, the last element is `v2`, and the middle elements (except for the first, second and last) are zeros, `i` is 2**
