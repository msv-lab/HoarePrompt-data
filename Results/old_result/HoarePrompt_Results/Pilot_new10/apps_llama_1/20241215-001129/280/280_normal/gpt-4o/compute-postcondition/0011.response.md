To calculate the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, we need to understand the pattern of how the `speeds` list is being updated.

The loop iterates from `1` to `t-1`, updating the `speeds` list at each index `i` with the minimum of two values:
1. `speeds[i - 1] + d`: This is the speed at the previous index plus the acceleration `d`.
2. `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d`: This is the final speed `v2` plus the acceleration `d` multiplied by the number of remaining indices.

From the output states provided for the first few iterations, we can observe the following pattern:
- The first element of `speeds` remains `v1`.
- The last element of `speeds` remains `v2`.
- Each middle element (except for the first and last) is calculated as the minimum of the previous speed plus `d` and `v2` plus the product of `d` and the number of remaining elements after the current index.

After all iterations have finished, `i` will be `t-1` because the loop iterates until `range(1, t)` is exhausted. 

If `t` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `speeds` remains a list with one element, `v1`. 

If `t` is greater than 1, the loop executes, and each element in `speeds` (except the first and last) is updated according to the pattern observed.

Therefore, after all iterations of the loop have finished, we can describe the output state as follows:

Output State: **`v1` is the original input integer, `v2` is the original input integer, `t` is the original input integer, `d` is the original input integer, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, each subsequent element (except the last) is the minimum of the previous element plus `d` and `v2` plus `d` times the number of elements remaining after the current index, the last element is `v2`, and `i` is `t-1` if `t` is greater than 1, otherwise `i` remains undefined because the loop does not execute.**
