To calculate the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given Python code on the initial state. 

The given code is: 
```
max_speed = max(v1, v2)
```
This line of code assigns the maximum value between `v1` and `v2` to the variable `max_speed`. 

Given the initial state: `v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.

The code does not affect the values of `t` and `d`, so they remain input integers. The values of `v1` and `v2` are also unchanged, they are still input integers. 

However, `max_speed` is now assigned the value of the maximum between `v1` and `v2`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`**
