v_1 and v_2 are positive integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), t is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), and d is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10 (inclusive) such that there exists a sequence of speeds starting with v_1, ending with v_2, and changing by at most d between consecutive seconds.
