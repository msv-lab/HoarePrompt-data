To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, we first need to understand the initial state and how the code snippet affects it. 

Given:
- `v1` is an input integer.
- `v2` is an input integer.
- `t` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `d` is an input integer.
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`.
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed`.
- `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t + max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))`.
- `min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t`.
- `i` is `t - 1`.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
min_length += min_speed
```

After executing this line of code, `min_length` is updated by adding `min_speed` to it. The new value of `min_length` becomes `min(v1, v2) * t + min_speed`. Since `min_speed` is the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed`, and `max_speed` is the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`, we need to consider these relationships in determining the new value of `min_length`.

However, given the definitions:
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed`, where `max_speed` is the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`. 

This implies that `min_speed` can be either `min(v1, v2) + d` if `min(v1, v2) + d` is less than or equal to the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`, or it is `max_speed` if `max_speed` is less than `min(v1, v2) + d`. But given `max_speed`'s definition, it's clear that `min_speed` effectively caps at `min(v1, v2)` when considering its contribution to `min_length`, because `min_speed` cannot exceed `max_speed`, and `max_speed` itself is capped at `min(v1, v2)` in scenarios where `min(v1, v2)` is greater than `max(v1, v2) - d`.

Therefore, the update of `min_length` to `min_length += min_speed` essentially means `min_length` becomes `min(v1, v2) * t + min(min(v1, v2) + d, max_speed)`. But for the purpose of this calculation and given the constraints, `min_speed`'s actual value depends on the relative values of `v1`, `v2`, and `d`, which dictates whether `min(v1, v2) + d` or `max_speed` is the minimum.

The other variables (`v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, `max_speed`, `max_length`, and `i`) are not affected by this line of code.

Thus, the output state after executing the code is:
- `v1` is an input integer.
- `v2` is an input integer.
- `t` is an input integer greater than 1.
- `d` is an input integer.
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`.
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed`.
- `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t + max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))`.
- `min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t + min(min(v1, v2) + d, max_speed)`.
- `i` is `t - 1`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer greater than 1, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t + max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))`, `min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t + min(min(v1, v2) + d, max_speed)`, and `i` is `t - 1`.**
