The code `print(total_distance)` prints the value of `total_distance` but does not change it. The value of `total_distance` remains the same, which is the sum of the elements in `speeds`, equal to the total distance based on the speeds defined by `v1`, `v2`, `d`, and `t`. 

Output State: **`v1` is the original input integer, `v2` is the original input integer, `t` is the original input integer, `d` is the original input integer, `speeds` is a list as initially described, `i` is `t-1` if `t` is greater than 1, otherwise `i` remains undefined, `total_distance` is the sum of the elements in `speeds`, which equals the total distance based on the speeds defined by `v1`, `v2`, `d`, and `t`, and the value of `total_distance` has been printed.**
