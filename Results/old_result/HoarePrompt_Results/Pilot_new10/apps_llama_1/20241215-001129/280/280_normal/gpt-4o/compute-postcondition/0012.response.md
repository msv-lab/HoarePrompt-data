To find the output state after executing the given code, let's analyze the initial state and the code itself.

The initial state gives us:
- `v1` is the original input integer
- `v2` is the original input integer
- `t` is the original input integer
- `d` is the original input integer
- `speeds` is a list with specific construction rules based on `v1`, `v2`, `d`, and `t`
- `i` is `t-1` if `t` is greater than 1, otherwise `i` remains undefined

The code to execute is:
```python
total_distance = sum(speeds)
```

Given the initial state and the code, the variable `total_distance` is assigned the sum of all elements in the `speeds` list. The `speeds` list construction is based on the given rules:
1. The first element is `v1`.
2. Each subsequent element (except the last) is the minimum of the previous element plus `d` and `v2` plus `d` times the number of elements remaining after the current index.
3. The last element is `v2`.

Let's denote the number of elements in the `speeds` list as `n`. Since the list's construction is dependent on `t`, and assuming the loop that defines `i` and constructs `speeds` has already been executed based on the given conditions, `n` can be considered equal to `t` if we're analyzing the direct outcome of the initial state's conditions.

The sum of the `speeds` list (`total_distance`) will be a combination of `v1`, `v2`, `d`, and `t`, reflecting the cumulative distance traveled based on the speeds defined in the list.

The state of `i` remains as initially defined: `i` is `t-1` if `t` is greater than 1, otherwise `i` remains undefined because the loop does not execute.

After executing the code, the new variable `total_distance` is introduced, and its value is the sum of the elements in the `speeds` list, which can be complex to express directly without specific values for `v1`, `v2`, `d`, and `t`. However, it can be represented as a function of these initial state variables.

Output State: **`v1` is the original input integer, `v2` is the original input integer, `t` is the original input integer, `d` is the original input integer, `speeds` is a list as initially described, `i` is `t-1` if `t` is greater than 1, otherwise `i` remains undefined, and `total_distance` is the sum of the elements in `speeds`, which equals the total distance based on the speeds defined by `v1`, `v2`, `d`, and `t`.**
