According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `t`. If `i` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `t - 1`, which means `t` is at least 1 and `i` is at least 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decreased by 1 (since the step is -1), so `i` becomes `t - 2`. 
State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer greater than 1, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `max(v1, v2) - d` and `min(v1, v2)`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `min(v1, v2) + d` and `max_speed`, `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t + max(max(v1, v2) - d, min(v1, v2))`, `min_length` is `min(v1, v2) * t + min(min(v1, v2) + d, max_speed)`, and `i` is `t - 2`**
