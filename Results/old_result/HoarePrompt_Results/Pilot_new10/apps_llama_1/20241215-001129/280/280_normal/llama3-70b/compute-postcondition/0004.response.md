To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code on the program.

The code `max_length = max_speed * t` calculates the value of `max_length` by multiplying `max_speed` and `t`. 

Given the initial state:
- `v1` is an input integer
- `v2` is an input integer
- `t` is an input integer
- `d` is an input integer
- `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`
- `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`

The value of `max_length` is directly calculated from `max_speed` and `t`, so we can express `max_length` as `max_speed * t`. Since `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, we can say `max_length` equals the maximum of `v1` and `v2` multiplied by `t`.

Therefore, the output state includes the initial conditions with the addition of `max_length` being equal to `max(v1, v2) * t`.

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`, `max_length` is `max(v1, v2) * t`**
