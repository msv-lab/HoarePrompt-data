The values of `t` and `d` are updated based on the input. The input is split into two integers, which are assigned to `t` and `d`, respectively. The previous constraints on `t` and `d` are overridden by the new values. The variables `v1` and `v2` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`v1` and `v2` are input integers, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
