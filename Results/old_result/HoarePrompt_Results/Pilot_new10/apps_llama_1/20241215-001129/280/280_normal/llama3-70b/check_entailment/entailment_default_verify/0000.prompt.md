You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The on-board computer on Polycarp's car measured that the car speed at the beginning of some section of the path equals v_1 meters per second, and in the end it is v_2 meters per second. We know that this section of the route took exactly t seconds to pass.

Assuming that at each of the seconds the speed is constant, and between seconds the speed can change at most by d meters per second in absolute value (i.e., the difference in the speed of any two adjacent seconds does not exceed d in absolute value), find the maximum possible length of the path section in meters.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers v_1 and v_2 (1 ≤ v_1, v_2 ≤ 100) — the speeds in meters per second at the beginning of the segment and at the end of the segment, respectively.

The second line contains two integers t (2 ≤ t ≤ 100) — the time when the car moves along the segment in seconds, d (0 ≤ d ≤ 10) — the maximum value of the speed change between adjacent seconds.

It is guaranteed that there is a way to complete the segment so that:  the speed in the first second equals v_1,  the speed in the last second equals v_2,  the absolute value of difference of speeds between any two adjacent seconds doesn't exceed d. 


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 


-----Examples-----
Input
5 6
4 2

Output
26
Input
10 10
10 0

Output
100


-----Note-----

In the first sample the sequence of speeds of Polycarpus' car can look as follows: 5, 7, 8, 6. Thus, the total path is 5 + 7 + 8 + 6 = 26 meters.

In the second sample, as d = 0, the car covers the whole segment at constant speed v = 10. In t = 10 seconds it covers the distance of 100 meters.
Program:
```
def func():
    (v1, v2) = map(int, input().split())
    (t, d) = map(int, input().split())
    max_speed = max(v1, v2)
    min_speed = min(v1, v2)
    max_length = max_speed * t
    min_length = min_speed * t
    for i in range(t - 1, 0, -1):
        max_speed = max(max_speed - d, min_speed)
        min_speed = min(min_speed + d, max_speed)
        max_length += max_speed
        min_length += min_speed
    print(max_length)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly calculate the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 

The main issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the maximum and minimum speeds at each time step. The current implementation only updates the `max_speed` and `min_speed` variables based on the previous values of `max_speed` and `min_speed`, which is not correct.

For example, when the input is `5 6` and `4 2`, the program should calculate the maximum possible length of the path segment by considering all possible speed sequences that satisfy the given constraints. However, the current implementation does not do this correctly.

A correct approach to solve this problem would be to use dynamic programming to calculate the maximum possible length of the path segment by considering all possible speed sequences.

Here is a simple example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
10 8
3 2
The correct output should be 30 (the sequence of speeds can be 10, 8, 12), but the program will not give this output.

To correctly solve this problem, you need to calculate the maximum possible speed at each time step based on the previous speeds and the given constraints, and then calculate the total length of the path segment based on these speeds. 

The given code does not implement this approach correctly, which is why it is incorrect. 

Here is a general outline of how you can solve this problem:

1. Initialize variables to store the maximum and minimum speeds at each time step.
2. Calculate the maximum and minimum speeds at the first time step based on the given initial speeds.
3. For each subsequent time step, calculate the maximum and minimum speeds based on the previous speeds and the given constraints.
4. Calculate the total length of the path segment based on the maximum speeds at each time step.

By following this approach, you can correctly calculate the maximum possible length of the path segment in meters. 

However, without a correct implementation of this approach, the program will not give the correct output for all possible inputs, which is why its correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function calculates and prints the maximum possible distance (`max_length`) that can be traveled under given constraints, including initial and final speeds (`v1` and `v2`), time (`t`), and maximum speed difference per time unit (`d`), but does not explicitly verify the existence of a valid sequence of speeds as suggested by the annotations. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
