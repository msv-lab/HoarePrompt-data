To solve this, we need to consider the initial state and apply the given Python code to it.

Given:
- `v1` is an input integer
- `v2` is an input integer
- `t` is an input integer and must be at least 2
- `d` is an input integer
- `speeds` is a list of length `t` where the first element is `v1`, the last element is `v2`, and the middle elements (except for the first and last) are zeros
- `i` is 1

The code snippet is:
```python
speeds[i] = min(speeds[i - 1] + d, v2 + (t - i - 1) * d)
```

Since `i` is 1, we're looking at the second element of the `speeds` list (because indexing starts at 0). The first element (`speeds[0]`) is `v1`, and we're updating the second element (`speeds[1]`).

The expression `speeds[i - 1] + d` becomes `v1 + d`, because `speeds[0]` is `v1` and `i - 1` equals 0.

The expression `v2 + (t - i - 1) * d` becomes `v2 + (t - 2) * d`, because `i` is 1.

So, the code effectively sets the second element of `speeds` to the minimum of `v1 + d` and `v2 + (t - 2) * d`.

The output state will be:
- `v1` is an input integer
- `v2` is an input integer
- `t` is an input integer and must be at least 2
- `d` is an input integer
- `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the second element is the minimum of `v1 + d` and `v2 + (t - 2) * d`, the last element is `v2`, and the other middle elements (except for the first and last) are zeros
- `i` is 1

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer and must be at least 2, `d` is an input integer, `speeds` is a list where the first element is `v1`, the second element is the minimum of `v1 + d` and `v2 + (t - 2) * d`, the last element is `v2`, and the middle elements (except for the first and last) are zeros, `i` is 1**
