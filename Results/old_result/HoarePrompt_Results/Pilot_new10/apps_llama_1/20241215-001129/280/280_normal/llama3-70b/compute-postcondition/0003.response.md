The code assigns the minimum of `v1` and `v2` to `min_speed`. The values of `v1`, `v2`, `t`, `d`, and `max_speed` are not affected. The value of `max_speed` is still the maximum of `v1` and `v2`. 

Output State: **`v1` is an input integer, `v2` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `max_speed` is the maximum of `v1` and `v2`, `min_speed` is the minimum of `v1` and `v2`**
