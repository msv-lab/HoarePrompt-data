The code increments `count_zeros` by 1. Initially, `count_zeros` is 0, so after the increment, `count_zeros` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still a non-empty numeric string, `k` is still an integer, `to_remove` is still 0, and `digit` is still '0'. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-empty numeric string, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is 1, `to_remove` is 0, `digit` is '0'**
