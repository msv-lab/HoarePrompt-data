The code increments the value of `w` by 1. The initial value of `w` is 2, so the new value of `w` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still the input integer divided by 100, and `k` is still an input integer. Additionally, `n` is still not divisible by 10.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer divided by 100 and not divisible by 10, `k` is an input integer, `w` is 3**
