The value of `n` is updated by performing integer division of `n` by 10. The value of `k` and `w` remains unchanged. The condition that `n` must not be divisible by `10` raised to the power of `k` is still valid for the original value of `n`, but after the update, `n` is now the integer part of `n` divided by 10.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer divided by 10 (integer division), `k` is an input integer, `w` is 1, and the original `n` must not be divisible by `10` raised to the power of `k`**
