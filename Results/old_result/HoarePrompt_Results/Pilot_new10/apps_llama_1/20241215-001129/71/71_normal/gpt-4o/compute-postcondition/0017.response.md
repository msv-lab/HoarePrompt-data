The given code is a `break` statement. This statement does not affect the values of the variables but causes the program to break out of the loop or conditional statement it is directly inside.

Output State: **`n` is a numeric string that must have at least one more digit, `k` is an integer. If the new last digit of `n` is '0', then `count_zeros` is 2 and `to_remove` is 0. If the new last digit of `n` is not '0', then `count_zeros` is 1 and `to_remove` is 1 if originally `count_zeros` was 0 and `to_remove` was 1, otherwise `count_zeros` is 0 and `to_remove` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
