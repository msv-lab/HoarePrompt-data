To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `n % 10 ** k!= 0`. This condition means the loop will continue as long as `n` is not divisible by `10` raised to the power of `k`.

Given states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is the input integer divided by 10 (integer division)
- `k` is an input integer
- `w` is 1
- The original `n` must not be divisible by `10` raised to the power of `k`

For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still not be divisible by `10` raised to the power of `k`. Since `n` has been adjusted by integer division by 10 in the previous iteration, to ensure the loop can execute again, `n` (after the division) must still have a remainder when divided by `10 ** k`. 

However, given that `n` is now the result of the input integer divided by 10, for `n % 10 ** k!= 0` to hold true after another iteration (considering `n` will be divided by 10 again in the next iteration), the current `n` must not be divisible by `10 ** (k-1)`, because if it were, dividing it by 10 would make it divisible by `10 ** k`, violating the loop condition.

The state of `w` being 1 and the condition on the original `n` do not directly affect the loop condition in terms of needing adjustment for the next iteration, as the loop's continuation depends solely on the divisibility of `n` by `10 ** k`.

Therefore, the adjustment needed is that `n`, after being divided by 10 (its current state), must still satisfy the condition that it is not divisible by `10 ** k`, implying the input integer (before any division) must have been such that after division by 10, `n` is not divisible by `10 ** (k-1)` to ensure the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n` is the input integer divided by 10, `k` is an input integer, `w` is 1, and the current `n` must not be divisible by `10 ** (k-1)`**
