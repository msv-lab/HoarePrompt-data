Postcondition: **`n` is the original numeric string input, `k` is an integer, `count_zeros` is the count of zeros from the end of `n` until `k` zeros are found or until all digits have been processed, and `to_remove` is the count of non-zero digits from the end of `n` until `k` zeros are found or until all digits have been processed. The current value of `count_zeros` is equal to `k`.**
