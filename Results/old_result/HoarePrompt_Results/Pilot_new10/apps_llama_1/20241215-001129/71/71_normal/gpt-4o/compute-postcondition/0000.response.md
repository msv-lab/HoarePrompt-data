The values of `n` and `k` are updated to be strings, where `n` is the first input and `k` is the second input. However, since the code uses `input().split()`, it is implied that the inputs are separated by spaces. The original constraints on `n` and `k` (i.e., `n` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 2,000,000,000, and `k` is a positive integer between 1 and 9) are no longer applicable as `n` and `k` are now strings.

Output State: **`n` is a string input, `k` is a string input**
