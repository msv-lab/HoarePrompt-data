The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a numeric string that must have at least one more digit after removing the last digit, `k` is an integer. If the digit is '0', then `count_zeros` is incremented by 1 and `to_remove` is updated accordingly based on whether the new last digit of `n` is '0' or not. If the digit is not '0', then `to_remove` is incremented by 1 and the conditions regarding `count_zeros` and its relation to the digits of `n` and the updated `to_remove` remain applicable based on the new last digit of `n`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
