The function `func` takes no parameters but accepts input from two lines: the first line contains two integers `n` and `L`, and the second line contains `n` integers representing the costs of bottles with volumes `2^i - 1` liters. 

It calculates the minimum cost to make `L` liters of lemonade by iterating through all possible combinations of bottles and selecting the combination with the minimum cost. 

If it is impossible to make `L` liters of lemonade with the given bottles, it returns `-1`; otherwise, it returns the minimum cost.

The function considers all potential cases, including edge cases where `n` or `L` is at the boundary of their defined ranges, or where the costs of the bottles are at their minimum or maximum allowed values.

Functionality: ** The function calculates the minimum cost to make a specified amount of lemonade using bottles of different volumes and costs, and returns the minimum cost if possible, or -1 if it is impossible to make the specified amount of lemonade. **
