Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that either `L` is unchanged if `L < 1 << i` or `L = L_original - 1073741824` where `L_original` is the original value of `L` if `L >= 1 << i`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, `c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`, if `L >= 1 << i` then `answer` is `10^18` and `current_cost` is `10^18`, and `i` is 30.**
