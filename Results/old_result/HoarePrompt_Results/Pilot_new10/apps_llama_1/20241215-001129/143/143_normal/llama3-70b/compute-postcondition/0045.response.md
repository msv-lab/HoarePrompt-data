To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `i` is `L + 1`
- `L` is greater than the previous `L`
- `n` is greater than 2
- `j` is 2
- `vol` is 1
- If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1] + costs[1]`

The code given is:
```python
vol = 2 ** j - 1
```

Now, let's calculate the new value of `vol`. Given `j` is 2, 
`vol` becomes `2 ** 2 - 1` which equals `4 - 1` and that simplifies to `3`.

So, the new value of `vol` is `3`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code. Therefore, `i` remains `L + 1`, `L` remains greater than the previous `L`, `n` remains greater than 2, `j` remains 2, and the condition regarding `dp[i]` remains applicable if the new `vol` (which is `3`) is less than or equal to `i`.

Given the new value of `vol` is `3`, if `3` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is still the minimum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1] + costs[1]`.

Output State: **`i` is `L + 1`, `L` is greater than the previous `L`, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3, and if `3` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[i - 1] + costs[1]`.**
