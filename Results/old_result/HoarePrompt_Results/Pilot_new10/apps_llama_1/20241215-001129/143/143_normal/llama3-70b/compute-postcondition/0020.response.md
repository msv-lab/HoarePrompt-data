According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is `costs[1]` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise it is infinity, and the rest are initialized with infinity, `i` is 2, and `j` is `n-1`. 

For the loop to execute, `j` should be the first value in the range, which is 0. The value of `i` does not affect the execution of the loop, but it is given as 2. 

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0 and `dp[1]` is `costs[1]` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise it is infinity, and the rest are initialized with infinity, `i` is 2, `j` is 0**
