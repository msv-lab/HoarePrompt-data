Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, `c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`, `answer` is `10^18`, `current_cost` is `0`, and `i` is 30. The current value of `L` is greater than or equal to `1` shifted left by `i` places (i.e., `L >= 1 << i`), given that `i` is 30, this implies `L >= 1 << 30`.**
