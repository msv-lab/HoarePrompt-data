Postcondition: ***`i` is `L + 1`, `L` is greater than the previous `L`, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `vol` is 3. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[i]` is the minimum of its previous value, `dp[i - 1] + costs[1]`, and `dp[i - vol] + costs[j]`; specifically, `dp[L + 1]` is the minimum of its previous value and `dp[L - 2] + costs[2]`. If `vol` is greater than `i`, then the state of `dp[i]` remains unchanged from its previous value.***
