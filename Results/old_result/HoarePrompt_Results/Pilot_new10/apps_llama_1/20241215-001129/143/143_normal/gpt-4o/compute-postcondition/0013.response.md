The code `dp[i] = min(dp[i], dp[i - 1] * 2)` updates the value of `dp` at index `i` to be the minimum between its current value and twice the value of `dp` at index `i - 1`.

Since `i` is 2, the code updates `dp[2]` to be the minimum between its current value and `2 * dp[1]`.

The value of `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `2 * dp[0]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `2 * dp[0]` and `dp[2]` is the minimum between its initial value and `2 * dp[1]`, and the rest of the `dp` list remains unchanged, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the costs from `costs` and the remaining elements are `max_cost`, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that `1 <= L <= 10^9`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list of 31 integers where `dp[1]` is the minimum between its initial value and `2 * dp[0]` and `dp[2]` is the minimum between its initial value and `2 * min(dp[0] * 2, dp[1])`, `c` is a list of 31 integers where the first `n` elements are the costs from `costs` and the remaining elements are `max_cost`, and `i` is 2**
