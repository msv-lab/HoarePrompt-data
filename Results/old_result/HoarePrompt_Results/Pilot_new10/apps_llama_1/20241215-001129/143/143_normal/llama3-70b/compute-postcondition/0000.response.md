The provided Python code is used to input two integers `n` and `L`. The value of `n` is the number of types of bottles in the store and `L` is the required amount of lemonade in liters. 

The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the input line into two parts and converts them into integers. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), input for the number of types of bottles and the required amount of lemonade has been taken.**
