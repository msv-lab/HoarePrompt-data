To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`
- `L` is an integer such that either `L` is unchanged if `L < 1 << i` or `L = L_original - 1073741824` where `L_original` is the original value of `L` if `L >= 1 << i`
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`
- `max_cost` equals `10^18`
- `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled
- `c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`
- if `L >= 1 << i` then `answer` is `10^18` and `current_cost` is `10^18`
- `i` is 30

And the given code snippet:
```python
answer = min(answer, current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i])
```

Since `i` is 30, `1 << i` equals `1 << 30` which is `1073741824`. 

The value of `(L > 0)` is 1 if `L` is greater than 0, and 0 otherwise. 

So, the code updates `answer` to be the minimum of its current value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`. 

Given that `answer` is `10^18` when `L >= 1 << i`, and `current_cost` is also `10^18` in that case, if `L >= 1 << i`, `answer` will be the minimum between `10^18` and `10^18 + (L > 0) * dp[i]`. Since `dp[i]` is a minimum between its original cost and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, it is less than or equal to `10^9` (because the maximum cost is `10^9`), `10^18 + (L > 0) * dp[i]` will be less than `10^18 + 10^9`, which is still less than `10^18` when considering the significant figures for the comparison (as `10^18` is a fixed value and adding any value less than `10^9` to it won't change its value significantly in comparison to another `10^18`). Therefore, if `L >= 1 << i`, `answer` remains `10^18`.

If `L < 1 << i`, `answer` was not necessarily `10^18`, so it will be updated to the minimum of its current value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`
- `L` is an integer such that either `L` is unchanged if `L < 1 << i` or `L = L_original - 1073741824` where `L_original` is the original value of `L` if `L >= 1 << i`
- `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`
- `max_cost` equals `10^18`
- `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled
- `c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`
- `i` is 30
- if `L >= 1 << i`, `answer` is `10^18` and `current_cost` is `10^18`, otherwise `answer` is the minimum of its original value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`.
 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer such that either `L` is unchanged if `L < 1 << i` or `L = L_original - 1073741824` where `L_original` is the original value of `L` if `L >= 1 << i`, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, `c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`, `i` is 30, if `L >= 1 << i`, `answer` is `10^18` and `current_cost` is `10^18`, otherwise `answer` is the minimum of its original value and `current_cost + (L > 0) * dp[i]`**
