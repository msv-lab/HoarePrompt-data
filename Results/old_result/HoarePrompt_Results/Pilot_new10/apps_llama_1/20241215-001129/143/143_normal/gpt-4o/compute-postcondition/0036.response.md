Output State: **The program returns the minimum cost that can be achieved by subtracting powers of 2 from the original value of `L` (which is 0) and adding the corresponding values from the `dp` list, where `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, and the original costs are from the list `costs` with `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`.**
