Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that `0 <= n <= 30`, `L` is an integer, `costs` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is a cost such that `1 <= cost <= 10^9`, `max_cost` equals `10^18`, `dp` is a list where each element is the minimum between its original cost (if it exists) and the propagated minimum from previous elements doubled, `c` is a list of 31 integers with the first `n` elements as costs from `costs` and the rest as `max_cost`, `i` is 29. If `L >= 1 << 29`, then `L` is updated to `L - 536870912`. If `L - 536870912 >= 1 << 29` after the update, `answer` is `10^18` and `current_cost` is `10^18 + dp[29]`. Otherwise, `answer` is the minimum of its original value and `current_cost + (L - 536870912 > 0) * dp[29]` and `current_cost` is updated to its previous value plus `dp[29]`. If `L < 1 << 29` initially, `L` remains unchanged and the conditions for `answer` and `current_cost` before the if statement are used.***
