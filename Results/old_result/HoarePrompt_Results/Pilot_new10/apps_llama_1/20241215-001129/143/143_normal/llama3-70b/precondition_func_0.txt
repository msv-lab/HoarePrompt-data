The function takes no parameters, but the input is provided in two lines: the first line contains two integers n and L (1 ≤ n ≤ 30; 1 ≤ L ≤ 10^9), and the second line contains n integers c_1, c_2,..., c_{n} (1 ≤ c_{i} ≤ 10^9), where n is the number of types of bottles in the store and the required amount of lemonade in liters, and c_i is the cost of a bottle of type i with volume 2^{i} - 1 liters.
