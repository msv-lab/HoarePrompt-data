Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30 (inclusive), `L` is an integer between 1 and 10^9 (inclusive), `costs` is a list of `n` integers, `dp` is a list of `L + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 0, `dp[1]` is `costs[1]` if `n` is at least 2, otherwise it is infinity. If `vol` is less than or equal to `i`, then `dp[2]` is the minimum of `costs[1]` and `costs[0] + costs[1]` if `n` is at least 2, and the rest of `dp` are initialized with infinity, `i` is 2, `j` is 0, `vol` is 0. If `vol` is greater than `i`, the state remains as in the precondition.***
