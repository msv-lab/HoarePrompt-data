According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` set. If the set has at least one more element, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `marks` has at least 1 integer, `i` is an element of `marks`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `marks` must have at least 2 elements and `i` is the next element in `marks`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `j` is the last element that was iterated over in `additional_marks`, and `additional_marks` contains all the values of `j` that satisfied the conditions `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks` during the iterations**
