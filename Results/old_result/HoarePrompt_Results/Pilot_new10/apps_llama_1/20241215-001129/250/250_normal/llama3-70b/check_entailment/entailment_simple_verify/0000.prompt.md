You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program has a bug in its approach to solving the problem. It incorrectly appends new marks to the additional marks list without checking if the new marks are necessary for measuring the distances x and y.

For example, consider the input:
5 10 3 7
0 1 2 6 9 10

In this case, the program should output 0 because the existing marks already allow us to measure the distances 3 (2-(-1) is not an option but 6-3 is not an option too, however 9-6 = 3, and for 7: 9-2 = 7) and 7.

However, the program will incorrectly output additional marks.

The program should be corrected to check if the new marks are necessary before adding them to the list. 

Also, there is a problem with the line where it says `for i in range(n):` because `n` is the number of marks but the list `marks` has `n` elements and lists are 0-indexed, so it should be `for i in range(len(marks)):`. 

Another issue with this code is that it checks all pairs of marks, which results in a time complexity of O(n^2). This could be optimized to O(n) by using a set to store the differences between marks.

Here is a possible correction for the code:
```python
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = sorted(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, l is a positive integer, x and y are positive integers such that 1 <= x < y <= l, and the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

If `need_x` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing the single element `x`; otherwise, the state of `additional_marks` is unchanged, as there is no else part to modify it.
    if (not need_y) :
        additional_marks.append(y)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` and `j` are equal to `n`. If `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`. If `need_y` is `True`, the state of `additional_marks` remains unchanged, but since there's no specific else part to modify it, the specifics of `additional_marks` when `need_y` is `True` are not further defined, except as initially given.
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are the original input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `additional_marks` contains all sums `i + j` where `i` is in `marks`, `j` is in the updated `additional_marks`, `i + j <= l`, and `i + j` is not in `marks`, `i` is the last element in `marks`, and `j` is the last element in the updated `additional_marks`.

    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))

1. **Input Parameters**: The function takes input from the user, which includes four integers: `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a sequence of `n` integers representing marks on a ruler. These inputs are obtained using the `input()` function in Python, which returns a string that is then mapped into integers.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - It first initializes a set `marks` with the input sequence of integers, ensuring uniqueness of elements.
   - It then checks for pairs of marks with differences of `x` and `y`, marking the existence of such pairs in `need_x` and `need_y` flags.
   - If a pair with a difference of `x` or `y` is not found, it appends `x` or `y` (respectively) to the list `additional_marks`.
   - The function then iterates over each mark in `marks` and each value in `additional_marks`. If the sum of a mark and an additional mark is less than or equal to `l` (the length of the ruler) and this sum is not already in `marks`, it appends this sum to `additional_marks`.
   - Finally, the function prints the number of elements in `additional_marks` and then prints all elements in `additional_marks`.

3. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - The function does not handle cases where the input is not as expected (e.g., non-integer inputs, `n` not matching the number of integers provided for `marks`, `x` greater than or equal to `y`, etc.).
   - The function does not explicitly check if `x` and `y` are within the bounds of the ruler (`1 <= x < y <= l`) as stated in the initial state of the program before the function call, relying on the user to input valid data.
   - The function can potentially enter an infinite loop or behave unexpectedly if the inputs lead to recursive or looping conditions that are not anticipated by the annotations (e.g., if the input for `marks` contains duplicate values, the set operation removes duplicates, but the function does not explicitly handle this case).
   - The annotations suggest that `i` and `j` are equal to `n` after the for loops, which might be a misunderstanding since `i` and `j` are iterated within the loops and do not retain a value outside their respective loops.

**Functionality**: **The function calculates additional marks that can be placed on a ruler of length `l`, given existing marks and target differences of `x` and `y`, and outputs the number and values of these additional marks. It handles cases where `x` or `y` differences are not found among existing marks and expands the set of additional marks based on unique sums of existing marks and newly added marks, up to the length of the ruler.**

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
