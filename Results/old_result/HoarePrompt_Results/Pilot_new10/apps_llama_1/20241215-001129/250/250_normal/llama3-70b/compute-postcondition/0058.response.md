Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 4. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_y` is `True`. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `x` equals `y`, `need_x` is `True`, and `need_y` is `True`. Otherwise, the state of `x`, `y`, `need_x`, and `need_y` remains as initially determined by the condition `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`.***
