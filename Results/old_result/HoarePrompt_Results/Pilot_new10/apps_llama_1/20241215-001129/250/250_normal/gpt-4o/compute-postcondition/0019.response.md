Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers with at least 2 marks, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `mark` is the second mark in the `marks` list. If `mark + x` or `mark - x` is in `marks_set`, then `x_found` is `True`, otherwise `x_found` retains its original value. If `mark + y` or `mark - y` is in `marks_set`, then `y_found` is `True`, otherwise `y_found` retains its original value if `mark + x` or `mark - x` is not in `marks_set`, otherwise `y_found` is `True`.***
