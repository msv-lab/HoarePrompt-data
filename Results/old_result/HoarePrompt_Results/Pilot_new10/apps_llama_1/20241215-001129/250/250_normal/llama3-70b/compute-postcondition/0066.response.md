To determine the output state, let's consider the impact of the given code on the program. The code is appending the value `y` to the list `additional_marks`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is an input integer
- `x` and `y` are input integers
- The ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers
- `marks` is a set of unique input integers
- `need_y` is a boolean value indicating whether there exists a pair of marks in `marks` with a difference of `y`, and its current value is `False`
- `i` and `j` are equal to `n`
- `additional_marks` is a list containing the single element `x`

After executing the code `additional_marks.append(y)`:
- `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, the ruler, `marks`, `need_y`, `i`, and `j` retain their initial values since the code does not modify them.
- `additional_marks` now contains two elements: `x` and `y`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `need_y` is `False`, `i` and `j` are equal to `n`, and `additional_marks` is a list containing the elements `x` and `y`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `need_y` is `False`, `i` and `j` are equal to `n`, and `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`.**
