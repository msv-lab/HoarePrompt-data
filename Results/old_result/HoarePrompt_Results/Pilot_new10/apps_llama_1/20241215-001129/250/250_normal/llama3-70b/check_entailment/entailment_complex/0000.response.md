Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The main issue is with the way it calculates the additional marks needed to measure the distances `x` and `y`.

According to the problem statement, Valery can add marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler. However, the program only checks if the differences `x` and `y` can be measured using the existing marks, and if not, it adds `x` and `y` to the list of additional marks. This approach is not correct because it does not consider all possible combinations of marks that could be added to measure the distances `x` and `y`.

Additionally, the program's logic for adding new marks based on the sums of existing marks and newly added marks is flawed. It can lead to unnecessary additional marks being added, which may not be the minimum required to measure the distances `x` and `y`.

A correct approach would be to check all possible combinations of marks that could be added to measure the distances `x` and `y`, and then select the minimum number of additional marks required. This would involve a more complex algorithm that considers all possible scenarios, rather than just checking for the existence of `x` and `y` differences among the existing marks.

Here is an example of a case where the program does not follow the problem description:

Input:
```
4 10 3 7
0 3 6 10
```
In this case, the program will output `0` because it can already measure the distances `3` and `7` using the existing marks. However, the problem statement requires the program to output the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure the distances `x` and `y`, which in this case is `0`. But if we change the input to:
```
4 10 3 7
0 4 6 10
```
The program will output `2` and add marks `3` and `7` to the ruler. But the correct output should be `1` and add mark `3` to the ruler, because we can measure `7` by using the marks `3` and `10`.

Therefore, the program does not correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement, and its output may not always be correct for all possible input cases.
