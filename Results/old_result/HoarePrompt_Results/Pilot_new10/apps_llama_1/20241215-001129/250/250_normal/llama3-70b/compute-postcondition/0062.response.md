Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `need_x` is `False` because there does not exist a pair of marks in `marks` with a difference of `x`, `need_y` is a boolean value indicating whether there exists a pair of marks in `marks` with a difference of `y`, `i` and `j` are equal to `n`, and `additional_marks` is an empty list**
