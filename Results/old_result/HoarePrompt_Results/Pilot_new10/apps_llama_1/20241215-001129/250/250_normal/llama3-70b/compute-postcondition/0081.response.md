According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` set. If `additional_marks` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. For `additional_marks` to have elements, there must be at least one `j` that satisfies the conditions `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks`. 

So, for the loop to be executed, `additional_marks` must have at least 1 element, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, and `i` is an element in `marks`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is an element in `marks`, `j` is the first element in `additional_marks`, `additional_marks` is a set with at least 1 element**
