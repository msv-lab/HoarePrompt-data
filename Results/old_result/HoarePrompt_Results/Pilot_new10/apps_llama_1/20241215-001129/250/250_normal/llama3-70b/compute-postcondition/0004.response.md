According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. If `n` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute. Since `i` is 0 and `n` must be greater than 0, the loop will execute. 

For the loop to execute, `j` should be equal to `i` at the start of the loop, which is 0. 

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `need_x` is `False`, `need_y` is `False`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
