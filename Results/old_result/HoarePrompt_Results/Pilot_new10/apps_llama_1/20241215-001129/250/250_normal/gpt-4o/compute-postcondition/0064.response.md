According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` list. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `marks` has at least 2 elements, `mark` is the second mark in `marks`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 elements and the `mark` is the third mark in the `marks`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 elements, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `y_found` is either `True` or `False`, `mark` is the third mark in `marks`**
