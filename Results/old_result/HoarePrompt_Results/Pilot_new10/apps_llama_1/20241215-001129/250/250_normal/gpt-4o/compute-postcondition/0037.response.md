The given Python code adds `mark + x` to the `new_marks` set. 

Since `new_marks` was an empty set, after executing this code, it will contain the value `mark + x`. 

The states of the other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `y_found`, `x_found`, `mark`) are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `y_found` is `True` if a mark plus or minus `y` is found in `marks_set`, `mark` is the first mark in `marks`, `x_found` is `False`, `new_marks` is a set containing `mark + x`.**
