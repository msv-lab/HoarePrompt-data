Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` is the previous `i`, `j` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2`. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is `True`. If `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `y`, then `need_y` is `True`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged regarding `need_x` and `need_y`.***
