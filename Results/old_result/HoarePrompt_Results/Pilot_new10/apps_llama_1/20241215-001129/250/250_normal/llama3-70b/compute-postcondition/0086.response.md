The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` appends a new element to the `additional_marks` set, which is the sum of `i` and `j`. 

Given that `i` is an element in `marks` and `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, the new element appended to `additional_marks` is `i + j`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is an element in `marks`, `j` is the next element in `additional_marks`, `additional_marks` is a set with at least 3 elements including the new element `i + j`.**
