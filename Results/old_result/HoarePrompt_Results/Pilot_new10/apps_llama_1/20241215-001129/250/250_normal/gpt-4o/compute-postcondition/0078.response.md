The value of `new_marks.pop()` has been printed and removed from `new_marks`. Since `new_marks` was not empty and contained elements added based on conditions, the size of `new_marks` decreases by 1. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `mark` is either the last mark processed or remains undefined if `marks` is empty, `new_marks` is a set containing one less element than before, `x_found` is `True` if the condition for `x` was met, `y_found` is `True` if the condition for `y` was met, the integer 1 has been printed, and the value of `new_marks.pop()` has been printed**
