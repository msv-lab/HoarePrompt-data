The code sets `need_y` to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer and must be greater than 2, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is `True`, otherwise `need_x` remains unchanged, `need_y` is `True**
