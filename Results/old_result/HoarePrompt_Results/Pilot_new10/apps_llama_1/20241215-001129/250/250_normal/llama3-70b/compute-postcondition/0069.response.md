According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` list. If `additional_marks` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. For `additional_marks` to have at least 1 element, `need_y` must be `False`, since `additional_marks` is defined as a list containing `x` and `y` when `need_y` is `False`. 

Before the loop starts, `j` is equal to `n`, but for the loop to execute, `j` should be the first element of `additional_marks`, which is `x`. 

So, for the loop to be executed, `need_y` must be `False`, `additional_marks` must have at least 1 element (which is ensured by `need_y` being `False`), `j` is `x`, and the other variables retain their initial states.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is an element of `marks`, `j` is `x`, `need_y` is `False`, `additional_marks` is a list containing `x` and `y`**
