According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `additional_marks` set. If `additional_marks` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `marks`, and `additional_marks` is a set that contains all possible values of `i + j` that satisfy the conditions `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks`. 

To ensure the loop executes, `additional_marks` must have at least one element. This means there must exist at least one `j` such that `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks`. 

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `marks`, `additional_marks` is a non-empty set, and `j` is the smallest element in `additional_marks`**
