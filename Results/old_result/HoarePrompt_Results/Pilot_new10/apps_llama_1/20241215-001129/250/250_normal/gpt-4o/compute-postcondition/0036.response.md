Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 1 element, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, the current value of `y_found` is `True` if a mark plus or minus `y` is found in `marks_set`, `mark` is the first mark in `marks`, `new_marks` is an empty set, either `y_found` is `False` or both conditions are met. The current value of `x_found` is `False`, meaning that no mark plus or minus `x` is found in `marks_set`. The current value of `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`.**
