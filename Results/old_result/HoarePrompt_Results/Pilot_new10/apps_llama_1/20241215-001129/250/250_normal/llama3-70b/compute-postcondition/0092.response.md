According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `marks` set. If the set has at least one more element, the loop can execute again for the next element. At the end of the last iteration, `marks` has at least 2 integers, `i` is one of the elements in `marks`. For the loop to execute one more time, the set `marks` must have at least one more element after the current `i`, and `i` must be the next element in `marks`. 

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `i` is the next element in `marks`, and `additional_marks` is a set that contains all possible values of `i + j` that satisfy the conditions `i + j <= l` and `i + j not in marks`**
