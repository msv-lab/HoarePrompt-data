To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `x` and `y` are input integers.
   - The ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers.
   - `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers.
   - `additional_marks` has at least two elements.
   - `j` is the next smallest element in `additional_marks`.
   - `i` is not defined in the initial state, but for the purpose of this operation, let's assume it's defined as part of the context not fully provided.

2. **Code Analysis**: 
   - The code `additional_marks.append(i + j)` adds a new element to the `additional_marks` list. This element is the sum of `i` and `j`.
   - Since `j` is the next smallest element in `additional_marks`, and assuming `i` is defined and has a specific value or relation to other variables (though not specified in the initial state), the sum `i + j` is appended to `additional_marks`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, and the ruler remain unchanged as they are not referenced in the code snippet.
   - `marks` remains unchanged as it is not referenced in the code snippet.
   - `additional_marks` is updated by appending a new element which is `i + j`.
   - The definition or value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so its impact or the exact value it contributes to `additional_marks` cannot be precisely determined without further context.

4. **Output State**:
   Given the information and focusing on the specific changes:
   - `n` is an input integer.
   - `l` is an input integer.
   - `x` and `y` are input integers.
   - The ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers.
   - `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers.
   - `additional_marks` now includes an additional element which is the sum of `i` and `j`, making it `additional_marks` with at least three elements, where the last element is `i + j`.
   - `j` was the next smallest element in `additional_marks` before the append operation; its status afterward depends on the value of `i + j` relative to other elements in `additional_marks`.

**Output State: ** `n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `additional_marks` has at least three elements where the last element is `i + j`, and `j` was the next smallest element in `additional_marks` before the append operation.
