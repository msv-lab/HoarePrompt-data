The value of `need_y` is set to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
The initial state was: `n` is at least 3, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, initially `i` was 2, initially `j` was 2, `need_y` is `True` if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[1] == y`, if there exists a `j` such that `marks[j] - marks[2] == x`, then the current value of `i` is 2 and the current value of `j` is such that `marks[j] - marks[i] == x`, and `need_x` is `True`. Otherwise, the current value of `i` is 2 and the current value of `j` is 2. Additionally, the difference between `marks` at index `j` and `marks` at index `i` equals `y`. 
However, now `need_y` is `True`, regardless of the previous condition.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `need_y` is True, and the difference between `marks` at index `j` and `marks` at index `i` equals `y`.**
