You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Valery is a PE teacher at a school in Berland. Soon the students are going to take a test in long jumps, and Valery has lost his favorite ruler! 

However, there is no reason for disappointment, as Valery has found another ruler, its length is l centimeters. The ruler already has n marks, with which he can make measurements. We assume that the marks are numbered from 1 to n in the order they appear from the beginning of the ruler to its end. The first point coincides with the beginning of the ruler and represents the origin. The last mark coincides with the end of the ruler, at distance l from the origin. This ruler can be repesented by an increasing sequence a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}, where a_{i} denotes the distance of the i-th mark from the origin (a_1 = 0, a_{n} = l).

Valery believes that with a ruler he can measure the distance of d centimeters, if there is a pair of integers i and j (1 ≤ i ≤ j ≤ n), such that the distance between the i-th and the j-th mark is exactly equal to d (in other words, a_{j} - a_{i} = d). 

Under the rules, the girls should be able to jump at least x centimeters, and the boys should be able to jump at least y (x < y) centimeters. To test the children's abilities, Valery needs a ruler to measure each of the distances x and y. 

Your task is to determine what is the minimum number of additional marks you need to add on the ruler so that they can be used to measure the distances x and y. Valery can add the marks at any integer non-negative distance from the origin not exceeding the length of the ruler.


-----Input-----

The first line contains four positive space-separated integers n, l, x, y (2 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 2 ≤ l ≤ 10^9, 1 ≤ x < y ≤ l) — the number of marks, the length of the ruler and the jump norms for girls and boys, correspondingly.

The second line contains a sequence of n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} (0 = a_1 < a_2 < ... < a_{n} = l), where a_{i} shows the distance from the i-th mark to the origin.


-----Output-----

In the first line print a single non-negative integer v — the minimum number of marks that you need to add on the ruler.

In the second line print v space-separated integers p_1, p_2, ..., p_{v} (0 ≤ p_{i} ≤ l). Number p_{i} means that the i-th mark should be at the distance of p_{i} centimeters from the origin. Print the marks in any order. If there are multiple solutions, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 250 185 230
0 185 250

Output
1
230

Input
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

Output
0

Input
2 300 185 230
0 300

Output
2
185 230



-----Note-----

In the first sample it is impossible to initially measure the distance of 230 centimeters. For that it is enough to add a 20 centimeter mark or a 230 centimeter mark.

In the second sample you already can use the ruler to measure the distances of 185 and 230 centimeters, so you don't have to add new marks.

In the third sample the ruler only contains the initial and the final marks. We will need to add two marks to be able to test the children's skills.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, l, x, y) = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))
    (need_x, need_y) = (False, False)
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i, n):
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == x:
                need_x = True
            if marks[j] - marks[i] == y:
                need_y = True
    additional_marks = []
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.append(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.append(y)
    for i in marks:
        for j in additional_marks:
            if i + j <= l and i + j not in marks:
                additional_marks.append(i + j)
    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, additional_marks)))


```
Output hints: To understand the functionality of the given function, we need to analyze the provided annotated code and consider the actual code as the truth, including any potential edge cases and missing logic.

1. **Input Parameters**: The function takes input from the user, which includes four integers: `n`, `l`, `x`, and `y`, followed by a sequence of `n` integers representing marks on a ruler. These inputs are obtained using the `input()` function in Python, which returns a string that is then mapped into integers.

2. **Function Behavior**:
   - It first initializes a set `marks` with the input sequence of integers, ensuring uniqueness of elements.
   - It then checks for pairs of marks with differences of `x` and `y`, marking the existence of such pairs in `need_x` and `need_y` flags.
   - If a pair with a difference of `x` or `y` is not found, it appends `x` or `y` (respectively) to the list `additional_marks`.
   - The function then iterates over each mark in `marks` and each value in `additional_marks`. If the sum of a mark and an additional mark is less than or equal to `l` (the length of the ruler) and this sum is not already in `marks`, it appends this sum to `additional_marks`.
   - Finally, the function prints the number of elements in `additional_marks` and then prints all elements in `additional_marks`.

3. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - The function does not handle cases where the input is not as expected (e.g., non-integer inputs, `n` not matching the number of integers provided for `marks`, `x` greater than or equal to `y`, etc.).
   - The function does not explicitly check if `x` and `y` are within the bounds of the ruler (`1 <= x < y <= l`) as stated in the initial state of the program before the function call, relying on the user to input valid data.
   - The function can potentially enter an infinite loop or behave unexpectedly if the inputs lead to recursive or looping conditions that are not anticipated by the annotations (e.g., if the input for `marks` contains duplicate values, the set operation removes duplicates, but the function does not explicitly handle this case).
   - The annotations suggest that `i` and `j` are equal to `n` after the for loops, which might be a misunderstanding since `i` and `j` are iterated within the loops and do not retain a value outside their respective loops.

**Functionality**: **The function calculates additional marks that can be placed on a ruler of length `l`, given existing marks and target differences of `x` and `y`, and outputs the number and values of these additional marks. It handles cases where `x` or `y` differences are not found among existing marks and expands the set of additional marks based on unique sums of existing marks and newly added marks, up to the length of the ruler.**

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
