To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the conditions and changes that occur within the loop. Given the loop statement `for j in additional_marks:`, the loop's execution depends on the elements in `additional_marks`. At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following state:

- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is an input integer
- `x` and `y` are input integers
- The ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers
- `marks` is a set of unique input integers that must have at least 1 integer
- `i` is an element of `marks`
- `j` is `x`
- If `i + x` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + x` is not in `marks`, then `need_y` is `False` and `additional_marks` is a list containing `x`, `y`, and `i + x`. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to take on the next value from `additional_marks`. Given that `additional_marks` contains `x`, `y`, and `i + x` (under the condition that `i + x` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + x` is not in `marks`), and assuming the previous iteration used `x` (since `j` is `x` at the end of the previous iteration), the next value for `j` would be `y`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, assuming all conditions are met for `additional_marks` to contain `x`, `y`, and `i + x`, and that the previous iteration processed `x`, would be:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is an element of `marks`, `j` is `y`, and `additional_marks` contains at least `y` and potentially `i + x` if the conditions are still met**.
