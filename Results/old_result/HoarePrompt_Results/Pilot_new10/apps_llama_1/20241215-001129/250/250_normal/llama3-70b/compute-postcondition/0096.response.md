Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers. If `i + j <= l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `additional_marks` is a non-empty set that includes `i + j`, and `j` is the smallest element in `additional_marks` which may have changed after the append operation. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
