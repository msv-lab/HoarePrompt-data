Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `need_y` is a boolean value indicating whether there exists a pair of marks in `marks` with a difference of `y`, and its current value is `False`, `i` and `j` are equal to `n`. The current value of `additional_marks` is a list containing the single element `x`, because `need_x` is `False`.**
