To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and the impact of the provided Python code snippet on this state.

Given Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer
- `l` is an input integer
- `x` is an input integer
- `y` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`
- `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 elements
- `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`
- `y_found` is either `True` or `False`
- `mark` is the third mark in `marks`

The provided Python code snippet is:
```python
new_marks.add(mark - x)
```

To determine the output state, let's analyze the impact of this code:

1. `new_marks` is not defined in the initial state, so it must be a set that is being modified or used for the first time here. Since `.add()` is a method used with sets, `new_marks` is a set.
2. `mark` is the third mark in `marks`, which means `mark = marks[2]`.
3. The value being added to `new_marks` is `mark - x`, which means we're adding the result of subtracting `x` from the third element of `marks` to the set `new_marks`.

Given that `new_marks` was not initially defined and assuming it has been initialized as an empty set before this operation (since we can't use `.add()` on an undefined variable without getting a NameError), the state of `new_marks` after this operation will be a set containing `mark - x`.

All other variables (`n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `marks`, `marks_set`, `y_found`) remain unchanged by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 3 elements, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `y_found` is either `True` or `False`, `mark` is the third mark in `marks`, and `new_marks` is a set containing at least one element which is `marks[2] - x`.**
