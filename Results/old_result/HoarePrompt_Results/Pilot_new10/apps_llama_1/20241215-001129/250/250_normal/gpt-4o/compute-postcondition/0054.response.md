To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. The initial state includes several variables with specific properties, and the code snippet involves adding a new element to a set named `new_marks` based on the value of `mark` (the second mark in `marks`) and `x`.

The provided code snippet is:
```python
new_marks.add(mark + x)
```
Given that `mark` is the second mark in `marks` and `x` is an input integer, we can analyze the impact of this line of code.

1. `new_marks` is not defined in the initial state, but based on the operation, it's clear that `new_marks` is a set that is being updated or initialized with the value `mark + x`. Since `new_marks` was not part of the initial state, we'll include it in the output state as a set containing at least the element `mark + x`.

2. The values of `n`, `l`, `x`, `y`, `a`, `marks`, `marks_set`, and `y_found` are not affected by the operation on `new_marks`. Therefore, these variables retain their initial properties.

3. The value of `mark` is also not changed by this operation; it remains the second mark in `marks`.

Thus, considering all the variables and their initial states, the output state after executing the given Python code snippet is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 elements, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `y_found` is either `True` or `False`, `mark` is the second mark in `marks`, and `new_marks` is a set containing at least the element `mark + x`.**
