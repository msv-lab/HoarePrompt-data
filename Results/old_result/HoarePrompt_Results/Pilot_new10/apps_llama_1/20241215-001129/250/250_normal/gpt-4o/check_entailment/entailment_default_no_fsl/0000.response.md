Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle every potential case correctly. Here's an example:

Input:
```
5 100 20 30
0 10 30 50 100
```

In this case, the ruler already has marks at 0, 10, 30, 50, and 100. The distance between 30 and 10 is 20, so `x` can be measured. However, there is no pair of marks with a difference of 30, so `y` cannot be measured. The code should add a mark at 50 + 20 = 70 or 50 - 20 = 30, but since 30 is already a mark, it should add 70, but it will add 20 and 30 instead.

Another issue is that the code checks if `x` and `y` can be measured separately, but it does not consider the case where adding a single mark can help measure both `x` and `y`. For example, if `x` is 20 and `y` is 30, adding a mark at 50 can help measure both `x` (50 - 30 = 20) and `y` (50 - 20 = 30), but the code will add two separate marks for `x` and `y`.

The code needs to be modified to handle these cases correctly. It should check all possible combinations of marks and find the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure both `x` and `y`.
