Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` and `y` are input integers, the ruler is an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers with at least 2 integers, `additional_marks` has at least one element, `j` is the next smallest element in `additional_marks`. If `i + j` is less than or equal to `l` and `i + j` is not in `marks`, then `i + j` is included in `additional_marks` and `j` is an input integer. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
