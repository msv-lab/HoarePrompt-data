Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` increasing integers where `a[0] = 0` and `a[n-1] = l`, `marks` is a list of input integers that must have at least 2 elements, `marks_set` is a set of unique input integers from `marks`, `y_found` is either `True` or `False`, `mark` is the second mark in `marks`. If `mark + y + x` or `mark + y - x` or `mark - y + x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains at least the element `mark + y`. If `x_found` is `False` and none of the above conditions are met, but `mark + x + y` or `mark + x - y` or `mark - x + y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains at least the element `mark + x`. If `x_found` is `False` and none of the above conditions are met, but `mark - x + y` or `mark - x - y` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` contains the element `mark - x` among its elements. If `x_found` is `False` and `mark - y + x` or `mark - y - x` is in `marks_set`, then `new_marks` also contains the element `mark - y`. If `x_found` is `True`, the state of the program remains unchanged.**
