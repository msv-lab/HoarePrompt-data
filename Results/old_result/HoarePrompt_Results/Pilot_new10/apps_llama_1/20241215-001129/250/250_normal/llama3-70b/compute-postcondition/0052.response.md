The code sets `need_y` to `True`. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `need_y` is True, if `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is True.
