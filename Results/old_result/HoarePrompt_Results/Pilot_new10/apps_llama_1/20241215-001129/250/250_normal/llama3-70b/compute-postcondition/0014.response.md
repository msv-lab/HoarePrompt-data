The code only changes the value of `need_y`. 
`need_y` is set to `True`, and the states of the other variables are not affected.
The ruler is still represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `n` is still an input integer greater than 0, `l` is still an input integer, `x` is still an input integer, `y` is still an input integer, `i` is still the previous `i`, `j` is still `i + 1`, `n` is still greater than `i + 1`, and if `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is still `True`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `l` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the ruler is represented by an increasing sequence of `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}`, `marks` is a set of unique input integers, `i` is the previous `i`, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `need_y` is `True`, and if `marks[j] - marks[i]` equals `x`, then `need_x` is `True`**
