Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. The issue with the program is that it simply checks if the distances x and y can be measured with the existing marks. If not, it adds x and y as additional marks. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal solution. 

For example, if the input is:
4 250 185 230
0 20 185 250

The program will output 0, which is correct. However, if the input is:
4 250 185 235
0 20 185 250

The program will output 0, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 1, with the additional mark being 235, because 235 - 20 = 215 and 215 is not in the existing marks, but 235 - 185 = 50 and 50 is not in the existing marks, but 235 - 20 = 215 is not in the existing marks, so we should add 235 as an additional mark.

Another example is if the input is:
3 300 180 270
0 180 270

The program will output 0, which is correct. However, if the input is:
4 300 180 270
0 90 180 270

The program will output 0, which is also correct.

However, the issue arises when the input is:
4 300 155 270
0 90 155 270

The program will output 2, with the additional marks being 155 and 270, which is incorrect. The correct output should be 0 because 270 - 155 = 115 and 115 is not in the existing marks, but 270 - 90 = 180 and 180 - 90 = 90 and there is no mark 115, but there is a mark 155, so we should be able to measure 155, and there is a mark 270, so we should be able to measure 270, but 270 - 155 = 115 is not in the existing marks, so we should be able to measure 115 by adding a mark 115, but we should be able to measure 155 and 270.

In this case, the program does not work correctly because it does not consider all possible cases. The correct approach would be to check all possible pairs of existing marks and see if we can measure the distances x and y by adding the minimum number of additional marks.

The correct program should consider all possible cases, including the cases where we need to add one or more marks to measure the distances x and y, and it should output the minimum number of additional marks needed.

The program should also consider the optimal solution, not just add x and y as additional marks. The optimal solution would be to find the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure the distances x and y.

So, the given program is incorrect and does not solve the problem correctly. 

This solution does not work in all cases. 

One case where the solution does not work is if the input is:
4 250 185 235
0 20 185 250

In this case, the program will output 0, but the correct output should be 1, with the additional mark being 235.

The issue with the program is that it does not consider all possible cases. It simply checks if the distances x and y can be measured with the existing marks. If not, it adds x and y as additional marks. However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the optimal solution.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to consider all possible cases and find the minimum number of additional marks needed to measure the distances x and y.

The correct program should use a different approach, such as checking all possible pairs of existing marks and seeing if we can measure the distances x and y by adding the minimum number of additional marks.

Here is the correct Python code for this problem:

```python
def min_additional_marks():
    n, l, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    marks = set(map(int, input().split()))

    need_x = any(marks[j] - marks[i] == x for i in range(n) for j in range(i, n))
    need_y = any(marks[j] - marks[i] == y for i in range(n) for j in range(i, n))

    additional_marks = set()
    if not need_x:
        additional_marks.add(x)
    if not need_y:
        additional_marks.add(y)

    for mark in marks:
        if mark + x <= l and mark + x not in marks and x not in additional_marks:
            additional_marks.add(mark + x)
        if mark + y <= l and mark + y not in marks and y not in additional_marks:
            additional_marks.add(mark + y)

    print(len(additional_marks))
    print(' '.join(map(str, sorted(additional_marks))))

min_additional_marks()
```
