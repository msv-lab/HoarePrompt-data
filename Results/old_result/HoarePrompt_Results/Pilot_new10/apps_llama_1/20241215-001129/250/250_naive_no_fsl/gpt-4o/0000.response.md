Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly determines the minimum number of additional marks needed on the ruler to measure the distances x and y. Here's why:

1. The program first checks if it's already possible to measure x and y with the existing marks. If both x and y can be measured, it prints 0 and no additional marks are needed.

2. If either x or y (or both) cannot be measured, it tries to find a single new mark that can help measure both x and y. This is done by checking all possible combinations of existing marks and the distances x and y.

3. If such a single new mark is found, it prints 1 and the value of the new mark.

4. If no single new mark can help measure both x and y, it checks if separate new marks are needed for x and y. If both x and y cannot be measured, it adds two new marks with values x and y. If only one of them cannot be measured, it adds a single new mark with the corresponding value.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

- If the ruler already has marks to measure both x and y, it doesn't add any new marks.
- If the ruler can measure one of x or y but not the other, it adds a new mark to measure the other distance.
- If the ruler cannot measure either x or y, it tries to add a single new mark to measure both distances. If that's not possible, it adds separate new marks for x and y.

The program's logic is sound and it correctly implements the problem description. It handles all possible cases and doesn't have any obvious errors or edge cases that it doesn't handle correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
