The code snippet is assigning new values to `a` and `b` by taking two integers as input and splitting them. The previous values of `a` and `b` are replaced by these new input values. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list containing [(a, b), (a, b)], `is_unrated` is `False`, loop counter `_` is 2, `a` is the new first input integer, `b` is the new second input integer, if `a` is not equal to `b`, then `is_rated` is `True`.**
