The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to the variable `n`. The initial state mentions a list of participants of length `n`, where `n` is between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), but the exact value of `n` is not specified. After executing the code, `n` will hold the value of the input integer.

Output State: **There is a list of participants of length `n`, where each participant has a rating before and after the round, and participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings, `n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive).**
