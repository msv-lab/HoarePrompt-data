The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it does exit the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples containing the input integers `a` and `b` for each participant, `i` is 2, `is_unrated` is `True`, `is_rated` remains unchanged, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
