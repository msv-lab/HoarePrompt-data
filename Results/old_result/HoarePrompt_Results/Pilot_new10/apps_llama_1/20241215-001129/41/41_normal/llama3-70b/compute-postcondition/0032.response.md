Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
