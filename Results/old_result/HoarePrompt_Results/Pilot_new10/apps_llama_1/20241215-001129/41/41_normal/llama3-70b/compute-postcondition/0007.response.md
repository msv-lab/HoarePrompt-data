According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1 because the loop has already executed once, so the value of `n` must be decreased by 1 internally in the loop, but for the loop to execute again it must be more than the current iteration. 
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `ratings_before` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integer `b`, `a` and `b` are input integers**
