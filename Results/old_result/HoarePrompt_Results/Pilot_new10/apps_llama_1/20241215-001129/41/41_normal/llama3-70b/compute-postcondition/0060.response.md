Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. If the element at index `i` in `ratings_before` is less than the element at index `j` in `ratings_before` and the element at index `i` in `ratings_after` is greater than the element at index `j` in `ratings_after`, then `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, `unrated` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
