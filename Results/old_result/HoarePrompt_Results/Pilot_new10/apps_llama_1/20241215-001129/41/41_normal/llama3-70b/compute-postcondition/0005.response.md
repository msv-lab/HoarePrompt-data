The code appends the value of `a` to the list `ratings_before`. The value of `n` is still greater than 0, and `ratings_after` is still an empty list. The values of `a` and `b` are still input integers. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `ratings_before` is a list containing the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is an empty list, `a` and `b` are input integers**
