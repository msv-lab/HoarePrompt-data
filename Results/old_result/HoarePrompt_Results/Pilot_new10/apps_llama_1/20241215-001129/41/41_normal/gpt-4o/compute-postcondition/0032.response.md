The code introduces a new boolean variable `is_unrated` and assigns it the value `True`. This does not affect the existing variables `n`, `ratings`, `i`, or the list of participants. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples containing the input integers `a` and `b` for each participant, `i` is 3, and `is_unrated` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples containing the input integers `a` and `b` for each participant, `i` is 3, and `is_unrated` is `True`**
