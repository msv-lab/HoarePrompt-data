According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1 so `j` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 3.
State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`**
