The code updates the values of `a` and `b` by accepting two input integers. The previous values of `a` and `b` are overridden by the newly input integers. The `n` variable, which is greater than 2, and the lists `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are not affected by this code. `ratings_before` still contains two instances of the original input integer `a`, and `ratings_after` still contains two instances of the original input integer `b`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `ratings_before` is a list containing two instances of the original input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing two instances of the original input integer `b`**
