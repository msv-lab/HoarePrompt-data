Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers. If `ratings_before[i]` is less than `ratings_before[j]` and `ratings_after[i]` is greater than `ratings_after[j]`, then `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `rated`, `unrated`, and `maybe` retain their original values of `False`, `True`, and `True` respectively.***
