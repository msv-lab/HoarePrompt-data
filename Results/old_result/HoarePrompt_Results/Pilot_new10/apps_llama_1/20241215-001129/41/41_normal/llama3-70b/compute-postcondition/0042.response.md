Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`. If the value of `ratings_before` at index `i` is less than the value of `ratings_before` at index `j` and the value of `ratings_after` at index `i` is greater than the value of `ratings_after` at index `j`, then `unrated` is `False` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
