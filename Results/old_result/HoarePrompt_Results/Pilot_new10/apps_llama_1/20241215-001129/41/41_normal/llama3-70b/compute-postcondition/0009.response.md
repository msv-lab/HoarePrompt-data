The code `ratings_before.append(a)` appends the value of `a` to the end of the list `ratings_before`. Initially, `ratings_before` is a list containing the input integer `a`. After executing the code, `ratings_before` will be a list containing the input integer `a` twice.

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still greater than 1, `a` and `b` are still input integers, and `ratings_after` is still a list containing the input integer `b`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` and `b` are input integers, `ratings_before` is a list containing two instances of the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing the input integer `b`**
