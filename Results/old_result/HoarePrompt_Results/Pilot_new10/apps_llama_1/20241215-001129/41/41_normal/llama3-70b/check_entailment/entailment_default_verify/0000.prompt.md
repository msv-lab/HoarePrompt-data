You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".


-----Examples-----

2194 2194
2876 2903
2624 2624
3007 2991
2884 2884

Output
rated

Input
4
1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

Input

3123 3123
2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings_before = []
    ratings_after = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ratings_before.append(a)
        ratings_after.append(b)
    rated = False
    unrated = True
    maybe = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]:
                unrated = False
                break
        if not unrated:
            break
    for i in range(n):
        if ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]:
            rated = True
            break
    if rated:
        print('rated')
    elif unrated:
        print('unrated')
    else:
        print('maybe')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program accurately determines whether a Codeforces round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code works correctly:

1. **Input and Initialization**: The program starts by taking the number of participants `n` as input and initializing two lists, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after`, to store the participants' ratings before and after the round, respectively.

2. **Flag Initialization**: Three flags are initialized: `rated`, `unrated`, and `maybe`, all set to their respective initial states. These flags help in determining the final output.

3. **Checking for Rating Changes**: The program iterates over the ratings to check if any participant's rating has changed. If a change is found, the `rated` flag is set to `True`.

4. **Checking for Unrated Condition**: It also checks if there's any instance where a participant with a lower rating before the round is placed above a participant with a higher rating before the round. If such a case is found and no ratings have changed, it indicates that the round is unrated because, according to the problem statement, if the round was rated, at least one participant's rating should have changed. This is handled by setting `unrated` to `False` if such a scenario is detected.

5. **Final Output**: Based on the states of the `rated`, `unrated`, and the conditions checked, the program prints out whether the round is "rated", "unrated", or "maybe". If `rated` is `True`, it means at least one rating has changed, so the round is rated. If `unrated` remains `True` after all checks (indicating no rating changes and no violation of the rating order), the round is unrated. Otherwise, if `rated` is `False` and `unrated` is `False`, it means there's a possibility but no confirmation of rating changes due to the competitive scenario, so the output is "maybe".

Given the provided problem description and examples, the code handles all scenarios as expected. It correctly identifies rated rounds when there are rating changes, unrated rounds when there are no changes and the order is as expected, and "maybe" when the conditions are ambiguous (no changes but potentially rated due to the competitive scenario). Without finding a specific case where the code fails to follow the problem description, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of pairs of integers representing the ratings of participants before and after a round, checks for rating changes and inconsistent rating updates, and prints 'rated' if any rating changed, 'unrated' if no ratings changed and updates are consistent, and 'maybe' if no ratings changed but updates are inconsistent. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
