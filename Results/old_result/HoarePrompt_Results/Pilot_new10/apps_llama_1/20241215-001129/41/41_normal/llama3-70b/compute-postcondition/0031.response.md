The `break` statement is used to exit the innermost loop or conditional statement that it is directly inside of. In this case, the values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. 

The states of `n`, `i`, `j`, `ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `rated`, `unrated`, and `maybe` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
