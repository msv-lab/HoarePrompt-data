Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples containing the input integers `a` and `b` for each participant, if `is_rated` is `False`, then `is_unrated` is `True` if any `ratings[i-1][0]` is less than `ratings[i][0]` for `i` in range(1, n), and the list of participants and `ratings` remain unchanged; otherwise, the state of `is_unrated` and the lists remains as it was before the if statement, since there is no else part to modify the state when `is_rated` is `True`.**
