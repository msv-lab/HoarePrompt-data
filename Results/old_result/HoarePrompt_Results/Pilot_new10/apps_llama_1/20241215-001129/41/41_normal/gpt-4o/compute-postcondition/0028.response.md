The code sets `is_unrated` to `True`. The previous values of `n`, `ratings`, `i`, and `is_rated` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples containing the input integers `a` and `b` for each participant, `i` is 2, `is_unrated` is `True`, and `is_rated` remains unchanged unless the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` in `ratings` is less than the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `ratings`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 3 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples containing the input integers `a` and `b` for each participant, `i` is 2, `is_unrated` is `True`, and `is_rated` remains unchanged**
