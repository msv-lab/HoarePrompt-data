Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `ratings_before` is a list of `n` input integers, `ratings_after` is a list of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `unrated` is `True`, and `maybe` is `True`. The current values of `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` at indices `i` and `j` are such that the value at index `i` in `ratings_before` is less than the value at index `j` in `ratings_before`, and the value at index `i` in `ratings_after` is greater than the value at index `j` in `ratings_after`.**
