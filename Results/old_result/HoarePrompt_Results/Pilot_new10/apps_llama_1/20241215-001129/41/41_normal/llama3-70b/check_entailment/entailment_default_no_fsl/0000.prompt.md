You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Is it rated?

Here it is. The Ultimate Question of Competitive Programming, Codeforces, and Everything. And you are here to answer it.

Another Codeforces round has been conducted. No two participants have the same number of points. For each participant, from the top to the bottom of the standings, their rating before and after the round is known.

It's known that if at least one participant's rating has changed, then the round was rated for sure.

It's also known that if the round was rated and a participant with lower rating took a better place in the standings than a participant with higher rating, then at least one round participant's rating has changed.

In this problem, you should not make any other assumptions about the rating system.

Determine if the current round is rated, unrated, or it's impossible to determine whether it is rated of not.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (2 ≤ n ≤ 1000) — the number of round participants.

Each of the next n lines contains two integers a_{i} and b_{i} (1 ≤ a_{i}, b_{i} ≤ 4126) — the rating of the i-th participant before and after the round, respectively. The participants are listed in order from the top to the bottom of the standings.


-----Output-----

If the round is rated for sure, print "rated". If the round is unrated for sure, print "unrated". If it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not, print "maybe".


-----Examples-----
Input
6
3060 3060
2194 2194
2876 2903
2624 2624
3007 2991
2884 2884

Output
rated

Input
4
1500 1500
1300 1300
1200 1200
1400 1400

Output
unrated

Input
5
3123 3123
2777 2777
2246 2246
2246 2246
1699 1699

Output
maybe



-----Note-----

In the first example, the ratings of the participants in the third and fifth places have changed, therefore, the round was rated.

In the second example, no one's rating has changed, but the participant in the second place has lower rating than the participant in the fourth place. Therefore, if the round was rated, someone's rating would've changed for sure.

In the third example, no one's rating has changed, and the participants took places in non-increasing order of their rating. Therefore, it's impossible to determine whether the round is rated or not.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ratings_before = []
    ratings_after = []
    for _ in range(n):
        (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
        ratings_before.append(a)
        ratings_after.append(b)
    rated = False
    unrated = True
    maybe = True
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(i + 1, n):
            if ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]:
                unrated = False
                break
        if not unrated:
            break
    for i in range(n):
        if ratings_before[i] != ratings_after[i]:
            rated = True
            break
    if rated:
        print('rated')
    elif unrated:
        print('unrated')
    else:
        print('maybe')


```
Output hints: The function accepts a list of pairs of integers representing the ratings of participants before and after a round, checks for rating changes and inconsistent rating updates, and prints 'rated' if any rating changed, 'unrated' if no ratings changed and updates are consistent, and 'maybe' if no ratings changed but updates are inconsistent.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
