To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the initial state.

The loop statement is:
```python
for j in range(i + 1, n):
```
This indicates that the loop will iterate over the range from `i + 1` to `n - 1` (since the upper bound in Python's `range` function is exclusive).

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than 2
- `i` is 2
- `j` is `n`
- `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers
- `rated` is `False`
- `maybe` is `True`

For the loop to execute, we need to consider the conditions that would allow it to run at least once. The critical factors here are the values of `i` and `n`, as they determine the range over which `j` iterates.

1. **Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `i + 1` is less than `n`, since `range(i + 1, n)` needs to have at least one element to iterate over. Given `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than 2, this condition is inherently met because `i + 1` (which equals 3) is less than `n`.

2. **Adjusting States**:
   - `n` must remain greater than 2 to ensure the loop can execute. However, since `i` is 2, `n` must specifically be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute at least once (`i + 1` must be less than or equal to `n` for the loop to have a chance to run).
   - `i` is given as 2 and does not need adjustment for the loop's execution condition but is a crucial factor in determining the range.
   - `j` is initially set to `n`, but for the loop to start, `j` will be set to `i + 1` (which is 3) because that's the starting point of the range.
   - The states of `ratings_before`, `ratings_after`, `rated`, and `maybe` do not directly affect the loop's condition to execute.

Therefore, the adjusted state to ensure the loop can execute at the start is:

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`**
