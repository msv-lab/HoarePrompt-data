The function accepts a list of pairs of integers representing the ratings of participants before and after a round, checks for rating changes and inconsistent rating updates, and prints 'rated' if any rating changed, 'unrated' if no ratings changed and updates are consistent, and 'maybe' if no ratings changed but updates are inconsistent.
