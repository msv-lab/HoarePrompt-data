Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples containing the input integers `a` and `b` for each participant, `is_rated` is `False`. If `is_unrated` is `True` because any `ratings[i-1][0]` is less than `ratings[i][0]` for `i` in range(1, `n`), then 'unrated' has been printed. Otherwise, `is_unrated` is `False`, 'maybe' has been printed to the console, and for all `i` in range(1, `n`), `ratings[i-1][0]` is greater than or equal to `ratings[i][0]`. The list of participants and `ratings` remain unchanged in both cases.**
