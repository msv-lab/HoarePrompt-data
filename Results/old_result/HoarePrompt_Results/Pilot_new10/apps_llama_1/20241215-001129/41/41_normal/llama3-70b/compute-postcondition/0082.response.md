Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. If `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`, then `rated` is `True` and we break out of the most internal loop. If `ratings_before[i]` is equal to `ratings_after[i]`, then no changes are made.***
