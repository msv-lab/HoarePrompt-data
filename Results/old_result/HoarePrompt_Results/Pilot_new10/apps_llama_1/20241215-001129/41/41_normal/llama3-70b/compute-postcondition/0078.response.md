Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers. If `ratings_before[i]` is not equal to `ratings_after[i]`, then `rated` is `True`, `maybe` is `True`, and `unrated` is `False` if there exists a pair of indices `i` and `j` in `range(n)` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, otherwise `unrated` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `ratings_before[i]` is equal to `ratings_after[i]`, then the state of `rated`, `maybe`, and `unrated` remains unchanged as the if condition is not met and no else part is executed to alter their state.***
