According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `_` (the loop variable) is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, `_` is 1 (since it's the second iteration after the first one where `_` was 0). For the loop to execute again, `_` should be incremented by 1, and `n` must be greater than the new value of `_`. 

Since the loop has already executed once, and we want it to execute again, the value of `_` should be 2 now (as the loop starts with `_` = 0, then 1, then 2, and so on). The lists `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` were not modified based on the loop variable `_`, so their state remains the same. 

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` and `b` are input integers, `ratings_before` is a list containing two instances of the input integer `a`, `ratings_after` is a list containing two instances of the input integer `b`**
