The code sets `is_rated` to `True`. This does not affect the values of `n`, the list of participants, `ratings`, `is_unrated`, the loop counter `_`, `a`, or `b`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list containing [(a, b), (a, b)], `is_unrated` is `False`, loop counter `_` is 1, `a` is the first new input integer, `b` is the second new input integer, `is_rated` is `True`**
