Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples containing the input integers `a` and `b` for each participant. If `is_rated` is `True`, then 'rated' has been printed. If `is_rated` is `False`, then if any `ratings[i-1][0]` is less than `ratings[i][0]` for `i` in range(1, `n`), 'unrated' has been printed; otherwise, 'maybe' has been printed and for all `i` in range(1, `n`), `ratings[i-1][0]` is greater than or equal to `ratings[i][0]`. The list of participants and `ratings` remain unchanged in all cases.***
