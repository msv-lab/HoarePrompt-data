Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, initially `rated` is `False`, and `maybe` is `True`. The current value of `ratings_before` at index `i` is less than the current value of `ratings_before` at index `j`, and the current value of `ratings_after` at index `i` is greater than the current value of `ratings_after` at index `j`.**
