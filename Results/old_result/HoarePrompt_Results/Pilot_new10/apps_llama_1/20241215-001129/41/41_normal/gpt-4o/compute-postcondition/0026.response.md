Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is a list of `n` tuples containing the input integers `a` and `b` for each participant, `i` is 1. If the first element of the tuple at index `i-1` in `ratings` is less than the first element of the tuple at index `i` in `ratings`, then `is_unrated` is `True` and `is_rated` is `False`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of `is_unrated` and `is_rated` remains unchanged.***
