The code snippet `a, b = map(int, input().split())` assigns the values of two space-separated integers from the input to variables `a` and `b`, respectively. 

The states of the other variables are not affected, but `a` and `b` become input integers. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`, loop counter `_` is 0, `a` and `b` are input integers.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 2 and 1000 (inclusive), there is a list of participants of length `n`, `ratings` is an empty list, `is_rated` is `False`, `is_unrated` is `False`, loop counter `_` is 0, `a` is the first input integer, `b` is the second input integer**
