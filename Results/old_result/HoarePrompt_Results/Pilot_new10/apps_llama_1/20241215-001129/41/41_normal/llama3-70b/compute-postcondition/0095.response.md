Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `ratings_before` and `ratings_after` are lists of `n` input integers, `rated` is `False`, `maybe` is `True`, for all `i` in `range(n)`, `ratings_before[i]` is equal to `ratings_after[i]`. If there does not exist a pair of indices `i` and `j` in `range(n)` such that `ratings_before[i] < ratings_before[j] and ratings_after[i] > ratings_after[j]`, then `unrated` is `True` and 'unrated' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, `unrated` is `False` and 'maybe' has been printed to the console.***
