The function takes an integer `n` and a string `s` as input from the user, calculates the number of transitions between different consecutive characters in the string `s`, and prints this count. If `n` is 1 or less, it prints 1. The function does not check if `n` is within the range of 1 to 500 or if `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of lowercase Latin letters.
