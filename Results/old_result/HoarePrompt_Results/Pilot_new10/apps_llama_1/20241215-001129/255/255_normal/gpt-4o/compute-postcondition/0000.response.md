The code snippet `n = int(input())` updates the value of `n` to be an integer input by the user. The initial value of `n` as a positive integer between 1 and 500 (inclusive) is overwritten. The value of `s` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length that was initially between 1 and 500 (inclusive) consisting of lowercase Latin letters, `n` is an input integer**
