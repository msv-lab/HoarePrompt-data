You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of lowercase Latin letters. You may apply some operations to this string: in one operation you can delete some contiguous substring of this string, if all letters in the substring you delete are equal. For example, after deleting substring bbbb from string abbbbaccdd we get the string aaccdd.

Calculate the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$.


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 500$) — the length of string $s$.

The second line contains the string $s$ ($|s| = n$) consisting of lowercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Output a single integer — the minimal number of operation to delete string $s$.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
abaca

Output
3
Input
8
abcddcba

Output
4
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    ans = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        if s[i] != s[i - 1]:
            ans += 1
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. The task is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string by removing contiguous substrings with equal letters. The program achieves this by iterating over the input string and incrementing a counter whenever it encounters a letter that is different from the previous one. This effectively counts the number of distinct letter groups in the string, which is equivalent to the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Strings with a single letter repeated throughout
* Strings with alternating letters
* Strings with a mix of different letters

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as:

* Strings with a length of 1 (i.e., a single letter)
* Strings with a length of 0 (not explicitly tested, but the program would not crash or produce incorrect results)

Overall, the program is simple, yet effective, and correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The examples provided in the problem description also demonstrate the program's correctness, as the output matches the expected results.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n` as inputs from the user, counts the number of segments of continuous characters in `s`, and prints this count, which is at least 1 and increases by 1 for each transition to a different character in `s`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
