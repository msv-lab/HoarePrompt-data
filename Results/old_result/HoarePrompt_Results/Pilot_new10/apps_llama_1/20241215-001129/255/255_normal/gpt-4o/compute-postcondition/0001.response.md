The value of `s` is updated to be the input string from the user. The previous constraint that `s` is a string of length between 1 and 500 (inclusive) consisting of lowercase Latin letters is no longer valid. The value of `n` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is an input integer**
