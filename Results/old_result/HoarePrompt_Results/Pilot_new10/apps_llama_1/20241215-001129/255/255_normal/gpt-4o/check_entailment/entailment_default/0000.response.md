Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code calculates the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string $s$ by counting the number of transitions between different consecutive characters in the string. This approach is correct because it takes into account the fact that all contiguous substrings with equal letters can be deleted in one operation.

The code works as follows: it initializes the `operations` counter to 1 (since we always need at least one operation to delete the string, even if it's empty) and then iterates over the string $s$. For each character, it checks if it's different from the previous character. If it is, it increments the `operations` counter. This effectively counts the number of times we need to switch between deleting different characters, which corresponds to the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string.

The code handles the edge cases correctly, such as when the string has only one character or when the string is empty (in which case the `operations` counter remains at 1). Additionally, the code does not rely on the input string being within a specific range or having specific properties, making it a general solution to the problem.

The output hints agree with the code, and the examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the code. For instance, the input "abaca" indeed requires 3 operations to delete the whole string (delete 'a', then 'b', then 'aca'), and the input "abcddcba" requires 4 operations (delete 'a', then 'b', then 'c', then 'ddcba'). Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
