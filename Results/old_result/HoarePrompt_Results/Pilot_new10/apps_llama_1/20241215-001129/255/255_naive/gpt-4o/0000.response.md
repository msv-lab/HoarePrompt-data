Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations required to delete a string by removing contiguous substrings of equal characters. The logic is based on the observation that each time a different character is encountered in the string, a new operation is needed to delete the substring of the previous character.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program works correctly:

1. The variable `operations` is initialized to 1, assuming that the first character (or group of contiguous identical characters) will be deleted in the first operation.

2. The program then iterates over the rest of the string. Whenever it encounters a character that is different from the previous one, it increments the `operations` counter. This is because the current character (or group of contiguous identical characters) will require a new operation to be deleted.

3. The program prints the total number of operations required to delete the entire string.

The given examples demonstrate the correctness of the program:

- For the input "abaca", the operations will be: delete "a", delete "b", delete "aca". So, the output is 3.

- For the input "abcddcba", the operations will be: delete "a", delete "b", delete "c", delete "ddcba". So, the output is 4.

In general, the program handles all possible cases correctly, including:

- Strings with a single unique character (e.g., "aaaa") will require only 1 operation.
- Strings with alternating characters (e.g., "ababab") will require 2 operations (one for each character).
- Strings with a mix of unique and repeating characters (e.g., "abcddcba") will require the correct number of operations based on the sequence of characters.

Since the program handles all these cases correctly and produces the expected output, its correctness can be confirmed.
