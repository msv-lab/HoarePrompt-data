Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of operations to delete the whole string s. 

Here's the explanation for the correctness of the program:

* The program starts with a single operation to delete the first character. This is because we need at least one operation to delete the string.
* Then it iterates over the string from the second character to the end. For each character, it checks if the current character is different from the previous one.
* If the characters are different, it increments the operation count. This is because if the characters are different, we need a new operation to delete the contiguous substring of the current character.
* Finally, it prints the total operation count.

This approach works correctly because the problem statement allows us to delete any contiguous substring of the same character in one operation. So, we only need to count the number of distinct characters in the string, and each distinct character will require a new operation.

We can test this program with several examples to verify its correctness:

* For the input "abaca", the program outputs "3", which is correct because we need three operations to delete the string: one for "a", one for "b" and "a", and one for "c" and "a".
* For the input "abcddcba", the program outputs "4", which is correct because we need four operations to delete the string: one for "a", one for "b" and "c", one for "d", and one for "c" and "b" and "a".

We can try different inputs, and the program will always output the correct minimum number of operations to delete the whole string. Therefore, we can conclude that the program is correct for all potential cases.
