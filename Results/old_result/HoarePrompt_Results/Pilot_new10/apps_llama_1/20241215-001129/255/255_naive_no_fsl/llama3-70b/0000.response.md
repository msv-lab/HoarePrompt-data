Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and works as expected according to the problem description. The task is to calculate the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string by removing contiguous substrings with equal letters. The program achieves this by iterating over the input string and incrementing a counter whenever it encounters a letter that is different from the previous one. This effectively counts the number of distinct letter groups in the string, which is equivalent to the minimum number of operations required to delete the whole string.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Strings with a single letter repeated throughout
* Strings with alternating letters
* Strings with a mix of different letters

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as:

* Strings with a length of 1 (i.e., a single letter)
* Strings with a length of 0 (not explicitly tested, but the program would not crash or produce incorrect results)

Overall, the program is simple, yet effective, and correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem. The examples provided in the problem description also demonstrate the program's correctness, as the output matches the expected results.
