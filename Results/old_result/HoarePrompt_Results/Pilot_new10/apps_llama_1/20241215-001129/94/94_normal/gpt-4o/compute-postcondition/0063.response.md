The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` adds the string `new_state_str` to the end of the `queue`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`start` is still a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, 
`directions` still has at least one more direction to process, 
`current` is still updated, 
`empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are still based on the updated `current`, 
`new_row` is still `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` is still `empty_col + dc`, 
`new_pos` is still `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, 
`visited` still includes `new_state_str` in addition to its previous values, 
`new_state` is still a list where the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped, 
and `new_state_str` is still a string equal to `''.join(new_state)`.

However, `queue` is now updated to include `new_state_str`.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, 
`directions` has at least one more direction to process, 
`current` is updated, 
`empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are based on the updated `current`, 
`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, 
`new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, 
`queue` is updated and includes `new_state_str` in addition to its previous values, 
`visited` includes `new_state_str` in addition to its previous values, 
`new_state` is a list where the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped, 
and `new_state_str` is a string equal to `''.join(new_state)`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `directions` has at least one more direction to process, `current` is updated, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are based on the updated `current`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `queue` is updated and includes `new_state_str` in addition to its previous values, `visited` includes `new_state_str` in addition to its previous values, `new_state` is a list where the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped, and `new_state_str` is a string equal to `''.join(new_state)`**
