The given code appends `new_state_str` to the `queue`. The initial state provides detailed information about the variables involved. 

Given that `queue` is not empty and `new_state_str` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, where 'X' is at the position `new_pos`, the `queue` will now contain all its previous elements plus the `new_state_str`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, including `new_state_str`, `queue` is not empty and now contains `new_state_str` as its last element, `current` may be updated, `empty_pos` may be updated, `empty_row` may be updated, `empty_col` may be updated, `directions` has at least 3 elements, `dr` and `dc` are the third elements of `directions`, `new_row` = `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` = `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` = (`empty_row + dr`) * 2 + (`empty_col + dc`), `new_state` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' where 'X' is at `new_pos`, `new_state_str` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, where 'X' is at the position `new_pos`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `visited` contains all reachable states from `start` that have been visited so far, including `new_state_str`, `queue` is not empty and now contains `new_state_str` as its last element, `current` may be updated, `empty_pos` may be updated, `empty_row` may be updated, `empty_col` may be updated, `directions` has at least 3 elements, `dr` and `dc` are the third elements of `directions`, `new_row` = `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` = `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` = (`empty_row + dr`) * 2 + (`empty_col + dc`), `new_state` is a list containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' where 'X' is at `new_pos`, `new_state_str` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, where 'X' is at the position `new_pos`.**
