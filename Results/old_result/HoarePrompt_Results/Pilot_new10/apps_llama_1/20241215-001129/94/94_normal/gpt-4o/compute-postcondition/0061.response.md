The given Python code is `new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)`. This line of code converts the list `new_state` into a string, where the elements of the list are concatenated together without any separator.

Given the initial state, we know that `new_state` is a list where the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped. The `start` variable is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, and other variables like `directions`, `current`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, `empty_col`, `new_row`, `new_col`, `new_pos`, `queue`, and `visited` are updated based on the `current` state.

After executing the given code, the `new_state_str` variable will be assigned the string value of the `new_state` list. The rest of the variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `directions` has at least one more direction to process, `current` is updated, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are based on the updated `current`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `queue` and `visited` are updated, `new_state` is a list where the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped, and `new_state_str` is a string equal to `''.join([new_state[new_pos] if i == empty_pos else new_state[empty_pos] if i == new_pos else new_state[i] for i in range(len(new_state))])`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `directions` has at least one more direction to process, `current` is updated, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are based on the updated `current`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `queue` and `visited` are updated, `new_state` is a list where the values at indices `empty_pos` and `new_pos` have been swapped, and `new_state_str` is a string equal to `''.join(new_state)`**
