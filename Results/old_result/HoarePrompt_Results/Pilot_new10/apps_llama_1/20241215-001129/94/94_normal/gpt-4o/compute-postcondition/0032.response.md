The code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list `new_state` that is a copy of the string `current`. 

The value of `new_state` will be a list of characters where each character is one of 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'X'. The order of the characters in `new_state` will be the same as the order in `start` since `current` is equal to `start`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing either the previous elements or the previous elements and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before and the new position is within the boundaries, `visited` is a set containing the string `start` and possibly `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before and the new position is within the boundaries, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `dr` is 0, `dc` is -1, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, `new_pos` is either -1, 0, 1, or 2 depending on the initial position of 'X', and `new_state` is a list of characters where each character is one of 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'X' in the same order as `start`.**
