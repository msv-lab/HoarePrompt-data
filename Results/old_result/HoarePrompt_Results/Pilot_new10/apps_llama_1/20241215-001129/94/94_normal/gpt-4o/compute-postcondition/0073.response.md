The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` adds the value of `new_state_str` to the end of the `queue`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

`new_state_str` is a string where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` in `start` are swapped. 

The value of `queue` is updated to include `new_state_str`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, 
`directions` has at least one direction to process, 
`current` is updated, 
`empty_pos` is based on the updated `current`, 
`empty_row` and `empty_col` are based on the updated `current`, 
`new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, 
`new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, 
`new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, 
`queue` includes all previously visited states and the new state `new_state_str`, 
`visited` includes all previously visited states and `new_state_str`, 
`new_state` is a list where the values at `empty_pos` and `new_pos` are swapped, 
`new_state_str` is `''.join(new_state)`.
