You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bessie the cow and her best friend Elsie each received a sliding puzzle on Pi Day. Their puzzles consist of a 2 × 2 grid and three tiles labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C'. The three tiles sit on top of the grid, leaving one grid cell empty. To make a move, Bessie or Elsie can slide a tile adjacent to the empty cell into the empty cell as shown below: $\rightarrow$ 

In order to determine if they are truly Best Friends For Life (BFFLs), Bessie and Elsie would like to know if there exists a sequence of moves that takes their puzzles to the same configuration (moves can be performed in both puzzles). Two puzzles are considered to be in the same configuration if each tile is on top of the same grid cell in both puzzles. Since the tiles are labeled with letters, rotations and reflections are not allowed.


-----Input-----

The first two lines of the input consist of a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Bessie's puzzle. The next two lines contain a 2 × 2 grid describing the initial configuration of Elsie's puzzle. The positions of the tiles are labeled 'A', 'B', and 'C', while the empty cell is labeled 'X'. It's guaranteed that both puzzles contain exactly one tile with each letter and exactly one empty position.


-----Output-----

Output "YES"(without quotes) if the puzzles can reach the same configuration (and Bessie and Elsie are truly BFFLs). Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
AB
XC
XB
AC

Output
YES

Input
AB
XC
AC
BX

Output
NO



-----Note-----

The solution to the first sample is described by the image. All Bessie needs to do is slide her 'A' tile down.

In the second sample, the two puzzles can never be in the same configuration. Perhaps Bessie and Elsie are not meant to be friends after all...
Program:
```
puzzle1 = [input() + input()]
puzzle2 = [input() + input()]
puzzle1 = ''.join(puzzle1).replace('\n', '')
puzzle2 = ''.join(puzzle2).replace('\n', '')
if func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
    (puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2]) = (puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1])
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not correctly implement the solution to the problem. The issue with the program is in the `func_1` function, where it attempts to swap the positions of the empty cells ('X') in the two puzzles and then checks if the sorted tiles are the same. This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual moves required to transform one puzzle into the other.

The program does not actually perform the necessary steps to determine if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. It only checks if the tiles are the same when sorted, which is not sufficient. The correct solution would involve implementing a breadth-first search (BFS) or depth-first search (DFS) algorithm to explore all possible moves from the initial configurations and check if the two puzzles can ever reach the same configuration.

A counterexample where the program does not work correctly is:

Input:
AB
XC
AX
BC

In this case, the program would incorrectly output "NO" because it does not correctly implement the logic to transform one puzzle into the other.

To correctly solve the problem, you would need to implement a search algorithm that explores all possible moves and checks if the two puzzles can ever reach the same configuration. The correct solution would involve a more complex implementation that takes into account the actual moves required to transform one puzzle into the other. 

A correct implementation would consider all possible moves (up, down, left, right) for the empty cell and recursively check if the puzzles can reach the same configuration. 

Here is a high-level example of a correct implementation:
```python
from collections import deque

def is_bffl(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    queue = deque([(puzzle1, puzzle2)])
    visited = set((puzzle1, puzzle2))

    while queue:
        p1, p2 = queue.popleft()

        if p1 == p2:
            return True

        for i in range(4):
            if p1[i] == 'X':
                x1 = i
            if p2[i] == 'X':
                x2 = i

        for dx, dy in [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]:
            nx1, ny1 = divmod(x1 + dx * 2 + dy, 2)
            nx2, ny2 = divmod(x2 + dx * 2 + dy, 2)

            if 0 <= nx1 < 2 and 0 <= ny1 < 2:
                np1 = list(p1)
                np1[x1], np1[nx1*2 + ny1] = np1[nx1*2 + ny1], np1[x1]
                np1 = ''.join(np1)

                if (np1, p2) not in visited:
                    queue.append((np1, p2))
                    visited.add((np1, p2))

            if 0 <= nx2 < 2 and 0 <= ny2 < 2:
                np2 = list(p2)
                np2[x2], np2[nx2*2 + ny2] = np2[nx2*2 + ny2], np2[x2]
                np2 = ''.join(np2)

                if (p1, np2) not in visited:
                    queue.append((p1, np2))
                    visited.add((p1, np2))

    return False

puzzle1 = input() + input()
puzzle2 = input() + input()

if is_bffl(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```
This implementation uses a BFS algorithm to explore all possible moves from the initial configurations and checks if the two puzzles can ever reach the same configuration. If the puzzles can reach the same configuration, it outputs "YES"; otherwise, it outputs "NO".

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
puzzle1 = [input() + input()]
puzzle2 = [input() + input()]
puzzle1 = ''.join(puzzle1).replace('\n', '')
puzzle2 = ''.join(puzzle2).replace('\n', '')
if func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: puzzle1 and puzzle2 are 2D lists of strings, each representing a 2x2 grid, where each string is either 'A', 'B', 'C', or 'X', and each grid contains exactly one 'A', one 'B', one 'C', and one 'X'.
def func_1(puzzle1, puzzle2):
    for i in range(4):
        if puzzle1[i] == 'X':
            x1 = i
        
        if puzzle2[i] == 'X':
            x2 = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `puzzle1` and `puzzle2` are 2x2 grids each containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', `i` is 3, `x1` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle1`, and `x2` is the index of 'X' in `puzzle2`.
    puzzle1[x1], puzzle2[x2] = puzzle2[x2], puzzle1[x1]
    return sorted(puzzle1) == sorted(puzzle2)
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two 2x2 grid parameters, each containing the strings 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X', swaps the 'X' values between the two grids, and returns True if the grids are identical after swapping and False otherwise, but may raise an error if 'X' is not found in either grid.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
