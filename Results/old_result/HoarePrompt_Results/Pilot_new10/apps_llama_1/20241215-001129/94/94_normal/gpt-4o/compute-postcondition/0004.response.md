The code removes the first element from the `queue` and assigns it to the variable `current`. Since the `queue` initially contains the string `start`, `current` is assigned the value of `start`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing no elements or waiting for the next configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle, `visited` is a set containing the string `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`**
