Postcondition: ***`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing either its previous elements or its previous elements and `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before, `visited` is a set containing the string `start` and possibly `new_state_str` if `new_state_str` has not been visited before, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `dr` is 0, `dc` is -1, `new_row` is `empty_row`, `new_col` is `empty_col - 1`, `new_pos` is either -1, 0, 1, or 2 depending on the initial position of 'X', `new_state` is a list of characters where `new_state[empty_pos]` is the character at index `new_pos` in the original `new_state` list and `new_state[new_pos]` is 'X', `new_state_str` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once. If `new_state_str` is not in `visited`, then `queue` contains `new_state_str` and `visited` contains `new_state_str`.***
