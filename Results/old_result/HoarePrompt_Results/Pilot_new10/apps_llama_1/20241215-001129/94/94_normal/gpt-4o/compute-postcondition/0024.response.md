To determine the output state, we need to understand the impact of the given code on the variables.

The code snippet is:
```python
new_state_str = ''.join(new_state)
```
This line of code converts the list of characters `new_state` into a string `new_state_str`.

From the initial state, we know that `new_state` is the list of characters in `current` after swapping 'X' with the character at `new_pos`. 

Given that `start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once and `current` is equal to `start`, the possible values of `current` are permutations of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X'. 

The `empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`, which determines `empty_row` and `empty_col`. With `dr` as 1 and `dc` as 0, `new_row` is `empty_row + 1` and `new_col` is `empty_col`. 

However, `new_pos` is `empty_pos + 2`, which must be interpreted within the valid moves of a 2x2 puzzle. Considering the 2x2 grid and the possible positions of 'X', if `empty_pos` is 0, 1, or 2, `new_pos` would be out of bounds or not a valid move in a 2x2 puzzle context for some starting positions of 'X'. 

For `empty_pos` as 0 (top-left), `new_pos` would be 2, which is valid but depends on `empty_row` and `empty_col`. For `empty_pos` as 1 (top-right), `new_pos` would be 3, which is valid. For `empty_pos` as 2 (bottom-left), `new_pos` would be 0, wrapping around is not considered in this linear interpretation, but it's essentially moving 'X' to the top-left if we were considering a wraparound or a specific puzzle rule allowing it. For `empty_pos` as 3 (bottom-right), `new_pos` would be 1, which is valid.

Since `new_state` is the result of swapping 'X' with the character at `new_pos` in `current`, and `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`, `new_state_str` will be a permutation of 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' reflecting this swap.

However, without knowing the exact initial arrangement of `start` (and hence `current`), we cannot determine the exact value of `new_state_str`. But we can say that `new_state_str` will be a string representing a new state of the puzzle after moving 'X' according to the calculated `new_pos`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this line of code.

Therefore, considering all provided information and the nature of the 2x2 sliding puzzle, the output state is: 
`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, 
`queue` is a deque containing either no elements or waiting for the next configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle, 
`visited` is a set containing the string `start` and possibly a new string, 
`directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], 
`current` is equal to `start`, 
`empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`, 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, 
`dr` is 1, 
`dc` is 0, 
`new_row` is `empty_row + 1`, 
`new_col` is `empty_col`, 
`new_pos` is interpreted within the context of valid moves in a 2x2 puzzle, 
`new_state` is the list of characters in `current` after swapping 'X' with the character at `new_pos`, and 
`new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state` after the swap.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing either no elements or waiting for the next configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle, `visited` is a set containing the string `start` and possibly a new string, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `dr` is 1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is `empty_row + 1`, `new_col` is `empty_col`, `new_pos` is `empty_pos + 2` interpreted within valid moves, `new_state` is the result of swapping 'X' with the character at `new_pos` in `current`, and `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`.**
