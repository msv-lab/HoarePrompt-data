The code `visited = set([start])` creates a set called `visited` and initializes it with the `start` string. 

Since `start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, the `visited` set is initialized with this specific string. 

The state of `queue` is not affected by this code, so it remains a deque containing the initial configuration `start` of the 2x2 sliding puzzle.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing the initial configuration `start` of the 2x2 sliding puzzle, `visited` is a set containing the string `start`.**
