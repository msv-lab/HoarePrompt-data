The code `new_pos = new_row * 2 + new_col` updates the value of `new_pos` based on the values of `new_row` and `new_col`. Since `new_row` is `empty_row + dr` and `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, we can substitute these expressions into the equation.

`new_pos` becomes `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `directions` has at least one direction to process, `current` is updated, `empty_pos` is based on the updated `current`, `empty_row` and `empty_col` are based on the updated `current`, `new_row` is `empty_row + dr`, `new_col` is `empty_col + dc`, `new_pos` is `(empty_row + dr) * 2 + (empty_col + dc)`, `queue` and `visited` are updated to include the previous values**
