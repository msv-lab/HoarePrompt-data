The given code snippet defines a list of directions, which are represented as tuples of x and y coordinates. 

The list of directions is: 
- `(-1, 0)` represents moving up
- `(1, 0)` represents moving down
- `(0, -1)` represents moving left
- `(0, 1)` represents moving right

Since this code does not affect the existing variables `start`, `queue`, and `visited`, their states remain the same. 

The new variable `directions` is added to the state with its given value. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing the initial configuration `start` of the 2x2 sliding puzzle, `visited` is a set containing the string `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)]**
