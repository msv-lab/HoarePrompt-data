The code `queue.append(new_state_str)` adds the string representation of the new state (`new_state_str`) to the end of the `queue`. 

The `queue` initially contains either no elements or is waiting for the next configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle. After the operation, it will contain the previous elements and `new_state_str`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, 
`queue` is a deque containing either the previous elements or the previous elements and `new_state_str`, 
`visited` is a set containing the string `start` and the string representation of the initial state of the puzzle after swapping 'X' with the character at `new_pos` in `current`, 
`directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], 
`current` is equal to `start`, 
`empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`, 
`empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, 
`empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, 
`dr` is 1, 
`dc` is 0, 
`new_row` is `empty_row + 1`, 
`new_col` is `empty_col`, 
`new_pos` is `empty_pos + 2` interpreted within valid moves, 
`new_state` is the result of swapping 'X' with the character at `new_pos` in `current`, 
`new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`, 
and `new_state_str` has been appended to `queue`.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing either the previous elements or the previous elements and `new_state_str`, `visited` is a set containing the string `start` and the string representation of the initial state of the puzzle after swapping 'X' with the character at `new_pos` in `current`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is the initial index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `dr` is 1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is `empty_row + 1`, `new_col` is `empty_col`, `new_pos` is `empty_pos + 2` interpreted within valid moves, `new_state` is the result of swapping 'X' with the character at `new_pos` in `current`, `new_state_str` is the string representation of `new_state`, and `new_state_str` has been appended to `queue`.**
