The code `current = queue.popleft()` removes and returns the leftmost element from the `queue` and assigns it to `current`. 

The value of `queue` was a queue containing at least one unprocessed reachable state from `start`, and after executing the code, `queue` still contains unprocessed reachable states from `start`, but with one less state. 

The `current` variable now holds the value of the removed state from the `queue`, which was a reachable state from `start`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are still determined by the initial position of 'X' in `current`, but now `current` has changed, so these variables might also change if the new `current` state has 'X' in a different position.

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` contains unprocessed reachable states from `start` with one state removed, `visited` contains `start` and all reachable states from `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to the removed state from `queue`, `empty_pos`, `empty_row`, and `empty_col` are determined by the position of 'X' in the new `current` state**
