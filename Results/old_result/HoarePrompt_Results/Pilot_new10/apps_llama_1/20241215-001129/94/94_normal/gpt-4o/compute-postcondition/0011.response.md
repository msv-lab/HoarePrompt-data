The line of code `new_state = list(current)` creates a new list `new_state` which is a copy of the string `current`. 

Since `current` is equal to `start`, and `start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, the value of `new_state` will be a list containing these same characters.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`start` is a string of length 4 containing the characters 'A', 'B', 'C', and 'X' exactly once, `queue` is a deque containing no elements or waiting for the next configuration of the 2x2 sliding puzzle, `visited` is a set containing the string `start`, `directions` is [(-1, 0), (1, 0), (0, -1), (0, 1)], `current` is equal to `start`, `empty_pos` is the index of 'X' in `current`, `empty_row` is `empty_pos` // 2, `empty_col` is `empty_pos` % 2, `dr` is -1, `dc` is 0, `new_row` is 0, `new_col` is either 0 or 1, `new_pos` is either 0 or 1, and `new_state` is a list containing the same characters as `current`.**
