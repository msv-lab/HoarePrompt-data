Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to correctly solve the puzzle problem. Here's why:

1. The program reads the initial configurations of both Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles.
2. It converts the puzzles into strings, which makes it easier to work with them.
3. The `func_2` function performs a breadth-first search (BFS) to find all reachable configurations from the initial configuration.
4. The BFS algorithm is correct and explores all possible moves (up, down, left, right) from the current position.
5. The program checks if there is an intersection between the reachable configurations of Bessie's and Elsie's puzzles. If there is, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case that the program does not handle correctly. The BFS algorithm is correctly implemented, and the program checks for all possible moves and reachable configurations.

However, it's worth noting that the program uses a set to store the visited configurations, which could potentially lead to issues if the puzzles are very large. But for the given 2x2 puzzle size, the program should work correctly.

The code is also well-structured, and the use of functions (`func_1` and `func_2`) makes the code more readable and maintainable.

Overall, I believe that the program is correct, and it should work as expected for all possible inputs.
