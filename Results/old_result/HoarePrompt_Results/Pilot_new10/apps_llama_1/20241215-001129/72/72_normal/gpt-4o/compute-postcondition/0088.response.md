Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` equals `y` and is 0, if `direction` is 1 and `row` equals `n`, then `row` equals `n - 2`, `direction` is -1, and `max_questions` and `sergei_questions` have been incremented by 1 from their previous values; if `direction` is not 1 and `row` is -1, then `x` is -2, `y` is 0, `row` is 1, `direction` is 1, `max_questions` is the previous value of `max_questions` minus 1, `sergei_questions` is the previous value of `sergei_questions` plus 1; otherwise, the state remains unchanged, and the current state of `x`, `y`, `max_questions`, and `sergei_questions` reflects the updates based on the loop body.**
