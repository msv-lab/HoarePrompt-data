The value of `max_questions` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`n` is still equal to `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, 
`m` is still equal to `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, 
`k` is still equal to `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, 
`x` is still equal to `input_x - 1`, 
`y` is still equal to `input_y - 1`, 
`full_cycles` is still calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, 
`remaining_questions` is still greater than 0, 
`min_questions` is still calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, 
`col` is still equal to `y + 2`, 
`m` is still greater than `y + 2` and `m` is still greater than `col`, 
if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is still incremented by 1.
Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, 
`m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, 
`k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, 
`x` equals `input_x - 1`, 
`y` equals `input_y - 1`, 
`full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, 
`remaining_questions` is greater than 0, 
`min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, 
`col` equals `y + 2`, 
`m` is greater than `y + 2` and `m` is greater than `col`, 
if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1,
`max_questions` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `x` equals `input_x - 1`, `y` equals `input_y - 1`, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `col` equals `y + 2`, `m` is greater than `y + 2` and `m` is greater than `col`, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1**
