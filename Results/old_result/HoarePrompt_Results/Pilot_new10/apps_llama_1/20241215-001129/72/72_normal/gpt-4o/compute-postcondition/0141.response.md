The value of `max_questions` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `max_questions` is unknown, so we can only say that `max_questions` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is increased by 1. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `max_questions` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is increased by 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1, and `max_questions` is increased by 1**
