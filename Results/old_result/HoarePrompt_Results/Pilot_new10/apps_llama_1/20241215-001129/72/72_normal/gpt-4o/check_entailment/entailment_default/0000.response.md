Correctness: **True**

The provided code appears to correctly implement the problem description. It accurately calculates the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and the number of times Sergei is asked.

Here's a breakdown of the code's correctness:

1. Handling edge cases: The code properly handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1, in which case the teacher always asks children from the same row.

2. Calculating full cycles: The code accurately calculates the number of full cycles of questions, where a full cycle consists of asking all pupils in the class in the specified order.

3. Calculating remaining questions: The code correctly calculates the number of remaining questions after the full cycles.

4. Calculating min and max questions: The code accurately calculates the minimum and maximum number of questions that can be asked to a particular pupil.

5. Calculating Sergei's questions: The code correctly calculates the number of times Sergei is asked, considering both the full cycles and the remaining questions.

The output hints agree with the code, and the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the code.

To further verify the correctness of the code, it would be necessary to test it with a wide range of inputs and edge cases. However, based on the provided information and the analysis of the code, it appears to be correct.

In conclusion, the code accurately implements the problem description, handles edge cases, and correctly calculates the required values. Therefore, the Correctness is **True**.
