Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, the current value of `row` equals the current value of `x`, the current value of `col` equals the current value of `y` and is 0, `direction` equals 1, and `max_questions` is updated based on the loop body, `sergei_questions` is the previous value of `sergei_questions` plus 1, and the current state of `x`, `y`, `max_questions`, and `sergei_questions` reflects the updates based on the loop body, with `x` and `y` having been updated based on the loop body if the previous `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`.**
