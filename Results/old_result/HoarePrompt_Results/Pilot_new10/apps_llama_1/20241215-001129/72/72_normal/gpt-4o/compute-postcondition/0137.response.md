Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0. If `direction` is 1, then `max_questions` is one more than its previous value. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` equals `n - 2`, `col` is 0, and `direction` is -1, otherwise `row` is `row + 1` and `col` is 0. If `direction` is not 1, and `row` is -1, then `row` is 1, `col` is 0, `direction` is 1, and `max_questions` is one less than its previous value. In all cases, the values of `full_cycles`, `min_questions`, `remaining_questions`, and `sergei_questions` are determined by whether `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, and the values of `row`, `col`, `direction`, and `max_questions` are updated based on the loop's boundary conditions.**
