The value of `direction` is updated to -1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 1, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` equals `y` and is 2, `row` equals `x + direction` which now equals `x - 1`, if `row + direction` equals `x`, then since `row` is `x - 1` and `direction` is `-1`, `row + direction` equals `x - 2` which does not equal `x`, so `sergei_questions` is not increased by 1, and `max_questions` is not increased by 1, `direction` is -1.
Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 1, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` equals `y` and is 2, `row` equals `x - 1`, `direction` is -1**
