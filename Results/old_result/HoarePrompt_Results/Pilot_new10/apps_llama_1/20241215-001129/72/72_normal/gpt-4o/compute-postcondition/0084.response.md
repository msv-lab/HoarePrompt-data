Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, the initial value of `x` was used to calculate `row` and `x`, where `row` equals `x + direction` and `x` equals `x + direction`, `y` is 0, `col` equals `y` and is 0, `direction` is not equal to 1, the previous value of `max_questions` was used to calculate the current value of `max_questions` which is the previous value of `max_questions` minus 1, and the previous value of `sergei_questions` was used to calculate the current value of `sergei_questions` which is the previous value of `sergei_questions` plus 1. The current value of `row` is -1.**
