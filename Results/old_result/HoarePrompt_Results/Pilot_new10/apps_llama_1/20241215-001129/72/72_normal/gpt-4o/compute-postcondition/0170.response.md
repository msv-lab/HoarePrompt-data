The function `func` accepts integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` as input, where `1 <= n, m <= 100`, `1 <= k <= 10^18`, `1 <= x <= n`, and `1 <= y <= m`. The function calculates the number of questions that will be asked to Sergei, the minimum number of questions that can be asked, and the maximum number of questions that can be asked.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of what the function does:

1. It first calculates the full cycle length, which is the total number of questions that will be asked in one full cycle. If `n` is greater than 1, the full cycle length is `(2 * n - 2) * m`, otherwise it's just `m`.
2. It then calculates the number of full cycles, which is the integer division of `k` by the full cycle length.
3. The function also calculates the remaining questions, which is the remainder of `k` divided by the full cycle length.
4. The minimum and maximum number of questions are calculated based on the number of full cycles and the value of `n`.
5. The function then updates the number of questions that will be asked to Sergei based on the value of `x` and `n`.
6. Finally, the function simulates the remaining questions and updates the maximum number of questions and the number of questions that will be asked to Sergei.

The function handles edge cases such as when `n` is 1, in which case the full cycle length is just `m`, and when `x` is 0 or `x` is `n - 1`, in which case the number of questions that will be asked to Sergei is updated accordingly.

However, there are some potential edge cases that are not explicitly handled by the annotations, such as when `k` is 0, or when `x` or `y` is out of range. But looking at the code, it seems that these cases are implicitly handled.

In terms of missing logic, the function seems to be missing a check for invalid input values, such as negative numbers or numbers outside the specified ranges.

Functionality: ** The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` as input, calculates the number of questions that will be asked to Sergei, the minimum number of questions that can be asked, and the maximum number of questions that can be asked, and prints these values, handling edge cases such as when `n` is 1, and implicitly handling cases such as when `k` is 0, or when `x` or `y` is out of range, but without explicitly checking for invalid input values. **
