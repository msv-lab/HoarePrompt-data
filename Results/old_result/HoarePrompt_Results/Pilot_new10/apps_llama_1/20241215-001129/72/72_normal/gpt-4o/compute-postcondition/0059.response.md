The value of `direction` is assigned to `-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `x` equals `input_x - 1`, `y` equals `input_y - 1`, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `col` equals `y + 2`, `m` is greater than `y + 2` and `m` is greater than `col`, `row` equals `x + direction` which is `x - 1`, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `direction` is `-1`.
Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `x` equals `input_x - 1`, `y` equals `input_y - 1`, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `col` equals `y + 2`, `m` is greater than `y + 2` and `m` is greater than `col`, `row` equals `x - 1`, if `x - 1` equals `x` and `y + 2` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, `max_questions` is incremented by 1, and `direction` is `-1`**
