Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `col` is increased by 1. If `direction` equals 1, then if `row` equals `n`, `row` is decreased by 3 and `direction` equals -1. In all cases, if `direction` equals 1 and (`row + direction - 1` equals `x` or `row - 4` equals `x` when `row` equals `n`) and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1 and `max_questions` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if `direction` equals 1, then `row` is increased by `direction`. If `direction` does not equal 1, then `max_questions` is decreased by 1, if `row` is -1, then `direction` equals 1 and `row` equals `row + 3`, otherwise `row` equals `row + direction`. If `direction` is not 1 and `row + direction` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.**
