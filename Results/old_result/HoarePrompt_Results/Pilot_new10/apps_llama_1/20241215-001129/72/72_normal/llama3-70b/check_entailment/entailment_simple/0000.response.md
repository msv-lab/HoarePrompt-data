Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

The problem with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case where n is 1 (i.e., there is only one row in the class) and the case where the teacher changes direction after reaching the last row.

Here is why the program is incorrect:

1. The line `max_asked = (k + (n - 1)) // (2 * n)` does not consider the case where n is 1. In this case, the teacher always asks children from the same row, so the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked should be `k // m` if `k` is a multiple of `m` and `(k // m) + 1` otherwise.

2. The line `min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))` does not correctly calculate the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked. This calculation does not consider the fact that the teacher changes direction after reaching the last row.

3. The line `sergei_asked = (k + x - 1) // (2 * n) + ((k + x - 1) % (2 * n) >= n - x + 1)` also does not correctly calculate how many times the teacher asked Sergei. This calculation does not consider the case where the teacher changes direction after reaching the last row.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to consider the following cases:

- When n is 1, the teacher always asks children from the same row.
- When n is greater than 1, the teacher changes direction after reaching the last row.

Here is an example of how the program could be modified to correctly calculate the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    
    if n == 1:
        max_asked = k // m if k % m == 0 else k // m + 1
        min_asked = max_asked
        sergei_asked = k // m if k % m == 0 else k // m + 1 if y <= k % m else k // m
    else:
        cycle = 2 * n - 2
        max_asked = k // (cycle * m)
        extra = k % (cycle * m)
        max_extra = 0
        for i in range(n):
            row = (i % (2 * n - 1)) + 1
            if row == n:
                row = n - ((i % (2 * n - 1)) + 1 - n)
            if extra >= m:
                max_extra += 1
                extra -= m
            else:
                max_extra = max(max_extra, extra)
                extra = 0
        max_asked += max_extra
        min_asked = max(1, max_asked - (n - 1))
        sergei_asked = k // (cycle * m)
        extra = k % (cycle * m)
        row = -1
        y_count = 0
        for _ in range(extra):
            row = (row + 1) % (2 * n - 1)
            if row < n - 1:
                row += 1
            else:
                row = 2 * n - 1 - row
            if row == x - 1:
                y_count += 1
        sergei_asked += y_count >= y
    
    print(max_asked, min_asked, sergei_asked)

```
This modified program correctly calculates the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei.
