Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `x` equals `input_x` - 1, `y` equals `input_y` - 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then the current value of `sergei_questions` equals `sergei_questions + 1`, otherwise the current value of `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` and `max_questions` are calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, the current value of `direction` equals 1.**
