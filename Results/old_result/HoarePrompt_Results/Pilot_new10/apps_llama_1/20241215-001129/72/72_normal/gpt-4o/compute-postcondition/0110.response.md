Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 1, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` equals `y` and is 2, if `row` equals `n`, then `row` equals `x - 3` and `direction` is -1, otherwise the state of `row` and `direction` remains as before, and `sergei_questions` and `max_questions` are increased by 1 if `row + direction` equals `x`.**
