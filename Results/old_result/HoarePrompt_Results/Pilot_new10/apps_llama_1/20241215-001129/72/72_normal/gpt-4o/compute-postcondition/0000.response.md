The code `n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` based on the input provided. The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the input into a list of integers, which are then assigned to `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`, respectively.

Given that the initial state specifies the ranges for `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`, after executing this line of code, these variables will take on the specific integer values provided by the input. The constraints from the initial state (1 <= n, m <= 100, 1 <= k <= 10^18, 1 <= x <= n, and 1 <= y <= m) no longer apply as specific values are now assigned to these variables based on the input.

However, without knowing the exact input, we cannot determine the exact values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y`. But we can say that `n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are integers, and their values are determined by the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `x`, and `y` are input integers, where `n` = input_n, `m` = input_m, `k` = input_k, `x` = input_x, and `y` = input_y**
