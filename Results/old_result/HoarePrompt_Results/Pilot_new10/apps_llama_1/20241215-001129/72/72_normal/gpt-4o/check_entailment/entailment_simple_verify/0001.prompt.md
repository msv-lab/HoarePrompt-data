You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the Literature lesson Sergei noticed an awful injustice, it seems that some students are asked more often than others.

Seating in the class looks like a rectangle, where n rows with m pupils in each. 

The teacher asks pupils in the following order: at first, she asks all pupils from the first row in the order of their seating, then she continues to ask pupils from the next row. If the teacher asked the last row, then the direction of the poll changes, it means that she asks the previous row. The order of asking the rows looks as follows: the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ..., the n - 1-st row, the n-th row, the n - 1-st row, ..., the 2-nd row, the 1-st row, the 2-nd row, ...

The order of asking of pupils on the same row is always the same: the 1-st pupil, the 2-nd pupil, ..., the m-th pupil.

During the lesson the teacher managed to ask exactly k questions from pupils in order described above. Sergei seats on the x-th row, on the y-th place in the row. Sergei decided to prove to the teacher that pupils are asked irregularly, help him count three values:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei. 

If there is only one row in the class, then the teacher always asks children from this row.


-----Input-----

The first and the only line contains five integers n, m, k, x and y (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, 1 ≤ x ≤ n, 1 ≤ y ≤ m).


-----Output-----

Print three integers:  the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked,  how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

-----Note-----

The order of asking pupils in the first test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the third table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table; 

The order of asking pupils in the second test:   the pupil from the first row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the first row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the second row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the second table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the first table;  the pupil from the fourth row who seats at the second table, it means it is Sergei;  the pupil from the third row who seats at the first table;

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It accurately calculates the maximum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, the minimum number of questions a particular pupil is asked, and how many times the teacher asked Sergei.

Here's a breakdown of the program's correctness:

*   The program correctly handles the case when there is only one row in the class. In this scenario, the teacher always asks children from this row, and the program accurately calculates the number of questions asked to each pupil.
*   For multiple rows, the program correctly calculates the length of a full cycle (i.e., the number of questions asked before the direction of the poll changes). It also accurately calculates the number of full cycles completed and the remaining questions.
*   The program correctly calculates the minimum and maximum number of questions asked to any pupil. It considers the number of full cycles and the remaining questions to determine these values.
*   The program also accurately calculates the number of times the teacher asked Sergei. It takes into account the row and column where Sergei is seated and the remaining questions to determine this value.
*   The program's logic is sound, and it handles all edge cases correctly, including the scenario when Sergei is seated in the first or last row.

After analyzing the program and considering various test cases, it appears to be correct and accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, k, x, and y are integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 100, 1 <= k <= 10^18, 1 <= x <= n, and 1 <= y <= m.
def func():
    n, m, k, x, y = map(int, input().split())
    x -= 1
    y -= 1
    full_cycle_length = (2 * n - 2) * m if n > 1 else m
    full_cycles = k // full_cycle_length
    remaining_questions = k % full_cycle_length
    min_questions = full_cycles
    max_questions = full_cycles
    if (n > 1) :
        min_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2)
        max_questions = (full_cycles + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` equals `input_n`, `m` equals `input_m`, `k` equals `input_k`, `x` equals `input_x` - 1, `y` equals `input_y` - 1. If `n` > 1, then `full_cycles` equals `input_k // ((2 * input_n - 2) * input_m)`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` equals `input_k // ((2 * input_n - 2) * input_m) // (2 * n - 2)`, and `max_questions` equals `(input_k // ((2 * input_n - 2) * input_m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. If `n` is 1, then `full_cycles` equals `input_k // input_m`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % input_m`, and `min_questions` equals `max_questions` equals `full_cycles`.
    sergei_questions = min_questions
    if (x == 0 or x == n - 1) :
        sergei_questions = full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1
    )
    else :

If `x` is 0 or `x` is `n - 1`, then `sergei_questions` equals `full_cycles // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= 1)`. Otherwise, `sergei_questions` equals `(full_cycles + input_x - 2) // (2 * n - 2) + (full_cycles % (2 * n - 2) >= input_x - 1)`. The conditions for `full_cycles`, `remaining_questions`, `min_questions`, `max_questions` based on `n` remain as initially stated, with the understanding that `n` must be greater than 1 for the `sergei_questions` update to apply when `x` is 0 or `x` is `n - 1`, and `x` is not equal to 0 and `x` is not equal to `n - 1` otherwise. If `n` > 1, then `full_cycles` equals `input_k // ((2 * input_n - 2) * input_m)`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % ((2 * n - 2) * m)`, `min_questions` equals `input_k // ((2 * input_n - 2) * input_m) // (2 * n - 2)`, `max_questions` equals `(input_k // ((2 * input_n - 2) * input_m) + n - 1) // (2 * n - 2)`. If `n` is 1, then `full_cycles` equals `input_k // input_m`, `remaining_questions` equals `k % input_m`, `min_questions` equals `max_questions` equals `full_cycles`.
