Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `x` equals `input_x - 1`, `y` equals `input_y - 1`, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `col` equals `y + 2`, `m` is greater than `y + 2` and `m` is greater than `col`. If `direction` equals 1, then if `row` equals `n`, `row` equals `x - 3`, `direction` is `-1`, and `max_questions` is incremented by 1, otherwise `row` equals `x + direction`. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is incremented by 1, and `max_questions` is incremented by 1. If `direction` does not equal 1, then `max_questions` is decreased by 1 from its original value, if `row` equals -1, then `direction` equals 1 and `row` equals `input_x + 2`, otherwise the state of `row` and `direction` remains unchanged.**
