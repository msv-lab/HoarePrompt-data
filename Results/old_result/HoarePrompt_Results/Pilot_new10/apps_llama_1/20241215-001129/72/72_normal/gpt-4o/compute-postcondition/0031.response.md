Postcondition: ***`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `x` equals `input_x - 1`, `y` equals `input_y - 1`. If `row` equals `n`, then `row` equals `n - 2`, `direction` equals -1, and `max_questions` equals `max_questions + 1`. If `n - 2` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` equals `sergei_questions + 1` considering the new value of `row`. Otherwise, `sergei_questions` remains unchanged. `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`. If `row` does not equal `n`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged with `row` equals `x + 1`, `col` equals `y`, and `direction` equals 1.***
