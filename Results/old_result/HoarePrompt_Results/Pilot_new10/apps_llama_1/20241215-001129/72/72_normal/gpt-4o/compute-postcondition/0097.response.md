The value of `max_questions` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `max_questions` is based on the updates from the previous iteration. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 1, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 1, `col` equals `y` and is 1, `row`, `direction`, `max_questions` is one less than its previous value based on the updates from the previous iteration, `x`, and `y` have values based on the updates from the previous iteration. If `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then `sergei_questions` is increased by 1.**
