The code increments `max_questions` by 1. The previous values of the other variables are not affected. 
So, `n` is still an integer greater than 0 and equals `input_n`, 
`m` is still an integer greater than 0 and equals `input_m`, 
`k` is still an integer greater than 0 and equals `input_k`, 
`x` is still equal to `input_x` - 1, 
`y` is still equal to `input_y` - 1, 
if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then the current value of `sergei_questions` is still `sergei_questions + 1`, otherwise the current value of `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, 
`full_cycles` is still calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, 
`remaining_questions` is still greater than 0, 
`min_questions` is still calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, 
the current value of `direction` is still 1, 
and `max_questions` becomes `max_questions + 1`.

Output State: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `x` equals `input_x` - 1, `y` equals `input_y` - 1, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y`, then the current value of `sergei_questions` equals `sergei_questions + 1`, otherwise the current value of `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `max_questions` equals `max_questions + 1`, the current value of `direction` equals 1**
