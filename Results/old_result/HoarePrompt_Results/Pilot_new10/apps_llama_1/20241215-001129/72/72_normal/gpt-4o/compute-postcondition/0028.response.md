Postcondition: **`n` equals `input_n` and is an integer greater than 0, `m` equals `input_m` and is an integer greater than 0, `k` equals `input_k` and is an integer greater than 0, `x` equals `input_x - 1`, initially, and then `row` equals `x + 1`, `y` equals `input_y - 1`, initially, and then `col` equals `y`, if `row` equals `x` and `col` equals `y` then `sergei_questions` equals `sergei_questions + 1` considering the new value of `row`, otherwise `sergei_questions` remains unchanged, `full_cycles` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `remaining_questions` is greater than 0, `min_questions` is calculated based on `n`, `k`, and `m`, `max_questions` equals `max_questions + 1`, and the current value of `direction` equals 1. The current value of `row` is equal to `n`.**
