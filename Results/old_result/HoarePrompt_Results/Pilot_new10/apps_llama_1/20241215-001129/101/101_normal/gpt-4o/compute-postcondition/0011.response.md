Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. If `i` is less than `top`, then the current value of `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`, and the current value of `screen` at position `(0, 0)` is 'w'. Otherwise, `i`, `j`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` retain their original values and `screen` also retains its original state. In both cases, the current value of `i` is greater than the current value of `bottom`.**
