Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is 0, `bottom` is `None`, `left` is `None`, `right` is `None`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the current value of `screen` at position `(0, 0)` is 'w', otherwise the state of the variables remains as in the precondition, with `i`, `j`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right` retaining their original values and `screen` also retaining its original state**
