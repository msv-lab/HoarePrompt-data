The value of `left` is updated to be equal to the current value of `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. If the original value of `i` was less than `top`, then the current value of `i` is 0, the current value of `j` is 0, `top` is 0, `right` is `None`, and the current value of `screen` at position `(0, 0)` is 'w'. Otherwise, `i`, `j`, `top`, `right` retain their original values and `screen` also retains its original state. If the original value of `i` was greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to be equal to the original value of `i`, and the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to the new value of `bottom`. In all cases, the current value of `j` is less than the current value of `left` which is equal to `j`, so `j` is less than itself which cannot be true unless `j` and `left` are not integers or are `None`, but based on the initial conditions `j` is 0 when `i` < `top`. The only possibility is `j` and `left` are equal to `None` or `j` is not an integer and can be equal to itself. Considering `j` can be equal to itself only when `j` is `None` because `left` is also `None` initially when `i` is not less than `top`, then in this case `j` should also be `None` and `left` = `j` = `None`, otherwise when `i` < `top`, then `left` = `j` = 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. If the original value of `i` was less than `top`, then the current value of `i` is 0, the current value of `j` is 0, `top` is 0, `right` is `None`, `left` is 0, and the current value of `screen` at position `(0, 0)` is 'w'. Otherwise, `i`, `j`, `top`, `right` retain their original values, `left` is equal to `j`, and `screen` also retains its original state. If the original value of `i` was greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is updated to be equal to the original value of `i`, and the current value of `i` is greater than or equal to the new value of `bottom`.**
