The value of `right` is assigned the value of `j`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` equals `j`. Regardless of the condition, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` equals `i`, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` equals `i`, and `right` equals `j`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `right` equals `j`, if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` equals `j`, `top` equals `i` if `i` is less than previous `top`, and `bottom` equals `i` if `i` is greater than previous `bottom`**
