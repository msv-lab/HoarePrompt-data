To determine the output state, we need to consider the initial state and the impact of the given code on it. The code is: `min_x, min_y = min(min_x, x), min(min_y, y)`. Given that `(x, y)` is the second coordinate in the `white_pixels` list and `min_x` and `min_y` were initially set to `x` and `y` respectively, we can infer the following:

- `n` and `m` remain unchanged as integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`.
- `pixels` remains a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", unchanged.
- `white_pixels` remains a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels` with at least 2 coordinates, unchanged.
- `min_x` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (which was `x`) and `x`. Since `x` is the same value that `min_x` was initially set to, `min_x` remains `x`.
- `min_y` is updated to be the minimum of its current value (which was `y`) and `y`. Since `y` is the same value that `min_y` was initially set to, `min_y` remains `y`.
- `max_x` and `max_y` are not modified by the given code, so they remain `x` and `y` respectively.

However, considering the logic of the code and the fact that `(x, y)` is the second coordinate in `white_pixels`, it seems there might have been an oversight in the interpretation. The code intends to update `min_x` and `min_y` by comparing them with the second set of coordinates from `white_pixels`. 

Given this correction, the accurate interpretation should be:
- `min_x` is updated to be the smaller of its current value and the x-coordinate of the second 'w' pixel, which could potentially be different from its initial value if the second 'w' pixel's x-coordinate is smaller.
- `min_y` is updated to be the smaller of its current value and the y-coordinate of the second 'w' pixel, which could also be different from its initial value if the second 'w' pixel's y-coordinate is smaller.

Thus, the correct output state, taking into account the potential for `min_x` and `min_y` to be updated based on the comparison with the second set of coordinates from `white_pixels`, is:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels` that must have at least 2 coordinates, `min_x` is the minimum of the initial `x` and the x-coordinate of the second 'w' pixel, `min_y` is the minimum of the initial `y` and the y-coordinate of the second 'w' pixel, `max_x` is `x`, `max_y` is `y`.**
