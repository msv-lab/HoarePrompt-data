Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, if `top` is None, then `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 1, `right` is 1. If `top` is not None, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `top` being 1 and `j` being less than or equal to `right`.**
