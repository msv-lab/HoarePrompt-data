The given code prints the first row of the `pixels` 2D list as a string. This operation does not change the values of any variables in the program. It only outputs the string representation of the first row. 

The values of `n`, `m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged, and `row` is still the first row in `pixels`. The `print` statement does not return any value; it simply outputs the string to the console.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a non-empty 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `row` is the first row in `pixels`, and the string representation of `row` has been printed to the console.**
