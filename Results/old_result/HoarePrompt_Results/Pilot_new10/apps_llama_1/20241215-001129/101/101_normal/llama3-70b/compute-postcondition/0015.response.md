Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise its current value is `float('inf')`, `min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise its current value is `float('inf')`, `max_x` is the largest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise its current value is `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is the largest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise its current value is `float('-inf')`, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and the current value of `frame_size` is greater than the maximum of `n` and `m`.**
