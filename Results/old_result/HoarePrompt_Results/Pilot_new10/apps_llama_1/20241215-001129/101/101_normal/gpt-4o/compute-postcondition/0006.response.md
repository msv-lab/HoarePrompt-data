The code `left = right = j` assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Given the initial state, `j` is 0. 

Therefore, `left` and `right` are both assigned the value 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
