Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`. If `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `bottom` is 1. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them.***
