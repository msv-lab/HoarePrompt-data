Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is an integer, `j` is an integer, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `top` and `bottom` are the minimum and maximum row indices of all 'w' characters in `screen` with `bottom` being at least `top + 1`, `frame_height` is at least 2, `frame_width` is at least 2, and `result` is a 2D list of characters where each inner list is a copy of the corresponding row in `screen`. The current value of `i` is either equal to `top` or equal to `bottom`, or the current value of `j` is either equal to `left` or equal to `right`.**
