Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, the first element of the first row of `screen` is 'w', the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` remain as previously determined based on the first row of `screen`, if `i` is less than `top`, then the current value of `top` is 1; otherwise, `top` remains unchanged, and the current value of `i` is greater than the current value of `bottom`**
