According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `pixels` list. If the list has at least 2 rows, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `row` is the first row in `pixels`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `row` must be the second row in `pixels`. The other variables `n`, `m`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` do not depend on the loop, so they remain the same.

State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a non-empty 2D list of size `n x m` with at least 2 rows, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `row` is the second row in `pixels`.**
