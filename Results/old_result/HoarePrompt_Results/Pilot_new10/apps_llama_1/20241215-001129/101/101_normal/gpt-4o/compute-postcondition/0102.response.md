The code updates the values of `left` and `right` to be equal to `j`. Given the initial state, `j` equals 0. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` equals 2, `j` equals 0, `top` equals 2, `bottom` equals 2, `left` equals 0, `right` equals 0, and the current value of `screen` at index `[i][j]` is 'w'**
