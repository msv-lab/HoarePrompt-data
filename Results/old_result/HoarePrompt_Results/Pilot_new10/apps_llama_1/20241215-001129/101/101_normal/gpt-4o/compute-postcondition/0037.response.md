The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. The initial state of the variables is as follows: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `j` is the next integer value, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `j` is the next integer value, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j`**
