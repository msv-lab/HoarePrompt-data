The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside the loop for the current iteration and moves to the next iteration. It does not change the values of any variables directly. 

Given the initial conditions and the statement `continue`, we know that if the current cell `pixels[i][j]` is `'w'`, we move to the next iteration, or if `pixels[i][j]` is `'.'` and it's not on the border defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y`, we also move to the next iteration.

Since `i` is the next integer after the loop's execution context plus one, and `j` is 1, after the `continue` statement, the loop will proceed to the next iteration, effectively incrementing `j` if the loop structure allows, or possibly incrementing `i` and resetting `j` if the loop structure is nested and `j` has reached its limit.

However, without specific details on the loop structure (e.g., for loops, while loops, nested loops), we can't determine exactly how `i` and `j` will change. But we know that `i` and `j` will move to the next positions to be checked according to the loop's progression rules.

Given the provided conditions and the `continue` statement:
- `n` remains an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n > i + 1`.
- `m` remains an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 1`.
- `pixels` remains a 2D list of size `n x m` with its described properties.
- `white_pixels` remains a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`.
- `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` remain the smallest and largest x and y-coordinates in `white_pixels`.
- `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.
- `i` will move to the next position based on the loop's progression rules, but its exact new value cannot be determined without knowing the loop structure.
- `j` will move to the next position based on the loop's progression rules, which could mean incrementing `j` or resetting `j` and possibly incrementing `i` if the loop is nested.

Since we cannot precisely determine how `i` and `j` change without the loop's specifics, we acknowledge that `i` and `j` will proceed to the next iteration according to the loop's rules, which could involve incrementing `j`, or if `j` has reached its limit, potentially resetting `j` and incrementing `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n > i + 1`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 1`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where if a cell is on the border defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` and its original value is `'.'`, then its value is `'+'`, otherwise if its value is `'w'`, it remains `'w'`, and all other cells are `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `max_y` and `min_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` and `j` proceed to the next iteration based on the loop's progression rules, which may involve changing `i` and `j` to check the next position in `pixels`.**
