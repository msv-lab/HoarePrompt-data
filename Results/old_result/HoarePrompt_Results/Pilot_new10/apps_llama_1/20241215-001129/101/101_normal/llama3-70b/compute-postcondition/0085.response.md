The code snippet is `continue`. This statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. It does not terminate the loop, but instead, it resumes the loop with the next iteration.

Since the `continue` statement does not modify any variables, the values of all variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n > i + 1`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 2`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `max_y` and `min_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer after the loop's execution context plus one, `j` is 2, and we skip to the next iteration of the loop.
