Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, and if `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then `top` is either 1 or its previous value, `bottom` is 1 if `i` is greater than the previous `bottom` otherwise it remains unchanged, and `right` is updated to `j` if `j` is greater than the previous `right` with `left` being 0, otherwise `right` and `left` remain as previously determined based on the first row of `screen`, with the additional condition that if `top` was None, it is set to 1.**
