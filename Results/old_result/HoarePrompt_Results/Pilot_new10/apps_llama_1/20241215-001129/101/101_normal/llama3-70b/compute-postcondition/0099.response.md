The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, it implicitly accepts the resolution of the monitor as a pair of integers `n` and `m`, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, and `n` lines of `m` characters each, where each character is either "." representing a black pixel or "w" representing a white pixel, with the guarantee that at least one pixel is white.

Since the problem statement doesn't specify the return value, I will wait for further information to complete the functionality description.


If the output were provided, I would proceed as follows:


Assuming the output is provided as:
Case_1: If all pixels are black, the function returns an error message.
Case_2: The function returns the number of white pixels.


The functionality of the function func is to accept the resolution and pixel data of the monitor and return the number of white pixels, handling the case when all pixels are black by returning an error message.


Functionality: **The function accepts the resolution and pixel data of the monitor, returns the number of white pixels or an error message if all pixels are black.**
