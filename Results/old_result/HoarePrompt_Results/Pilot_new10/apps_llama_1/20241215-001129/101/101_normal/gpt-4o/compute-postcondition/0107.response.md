Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, initially `i` equals 2, initially `j` equals 0, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `right` are the minimum and maximum row and column indices of 'w' characters in the first row of `screen`, and the current value of `screen` at index `[i][j]` is 'w'. If `i` is less than `top`, then the current value of `top` equals 2, otherwise, `top` remains as previously defined. Additionally, the current value of `i` is greater than the current value of `bottom`.**
