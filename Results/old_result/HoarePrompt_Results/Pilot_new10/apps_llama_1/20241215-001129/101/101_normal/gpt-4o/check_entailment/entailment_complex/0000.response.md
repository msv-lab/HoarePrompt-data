Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description in all cases. 

The problem description asks for the smallest possible square frame that includes all white pixels, whereas the program simply finds the bounding box of all white pixels and draws a frame around it. This does not guarantee a square frame.

For example, if the input is:
```
4 8
..w..w..
........
........
..w..w..
```
The program will output:
```
..w++w..
..+..+..
..+..+..
..w++w..
```
However, this is not the smallest possible square frame that includes all white pixels. The smallest possible square frame would be a 4x4 square, but it is not centered around the white pixels.

Another issue with the program is that it does not check if the frame goes beyond the borders of the screen. If the white pixels are located near the borders of the screen, the program may draw a frame that extends beyond the borders of the screen.

To correctly implement the problem description, the program needs to find the smallest possible square frame that includes all white pixels, without going beyond the borders of the screen. This may involve checking different sizes and positions of the square frame to find the smallest one that meets the conditions.

Here is a possible corrected version of the program:
```python
def func_1(n, m, screen):
    top = bottom = left = right = None
    for i in range(n):
        for j in range(m):
            if screen[i][j] == 'w':
                if top is None:
                    top = bottom = i
                    left = right = j
                else:
                    if i < top:
                        top = i
                    if i > bottom:
                        bottom = i
                    if j < left:
                        left = j
                    if j > right:
                        right = j

    if (top is None or bottom is None or left is None or right is None) :
        return -1

    min_size = max(bottom - top + 1, right - left + 1)
    for size in range(min_size, n + m):
        for i in range(n - size + 1):
            for j in range(m - size + 1):
                frame = [[screen[x][y] for y in range(j, j + size)] for x in range(i, i + size)]
                if all('w' in row for row in frame):
                    result = [['+' if i + x == 0 or i + x == size - 1 or j + y == 0 or j + y == size - 1 else screen[i + x][j + y] for y in range(m)] for x in range(n)]
                    return result

    return -1
```
This corrected version of the program checks different sizes and positions of the square frame to find the smallest one that meets the conditions. It first finds the minimum size of the square frame that includes all white pixels, and then checks all possible positions of the square frame of that size. If it finds a position that includes all white pixels, it returns the corresponding frame. If it does not find any such position, it returns -1.
