To calculate the output state, we need to consider the initial state and the impact of the code on the program. 

The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is updated to be equal to `i`, `bottom` is 0, `left` is 0, `right` is `None`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, or `j`, and the original values of `n`, `m`, `screen` are retained.

The given code is: 
```python
bottom = i
```
This code updates the value of `bottom` to be equal to `i`. 

Given that `i` is 0, `bottom` will be updated to 0. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. If `i` is less than `top`, then `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is 0, `right` is `None`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to `top`, `bottom`, `left`, `right`, `i`, or `j`, and the original values of `n`, `m`, `screen` are retained.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters, `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is 0, `right` is `None`, `i` is 0, and `j` is 1**
