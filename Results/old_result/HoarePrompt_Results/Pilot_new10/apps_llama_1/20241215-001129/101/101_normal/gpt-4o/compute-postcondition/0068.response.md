Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', if `top` is None, then `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 0, and `right` is 0. Otherwise, `top` is either 1 or its previous value, `bottom` is 1 if `i` is greater than the previous `bottom`, otherwise it remains unchanged, and if `j` is greater than the previous `right`, then `right` is updated to `j` and `left` is 0, otherwise `right` and `left` remain as previously determined based on the first row of `screen`.**
