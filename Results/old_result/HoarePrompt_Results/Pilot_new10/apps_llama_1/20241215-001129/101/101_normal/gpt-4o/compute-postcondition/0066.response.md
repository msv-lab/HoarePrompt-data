The code `right = j` updates the value of `right` to be equal to the current value of `j`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, the first element of the first row of `screen` is 'w', the current value of `screen[i][j]` is 'w', `top` is either 1 or its previous value, if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` is 1, otherwise, `bottom` remains unchanged, `right` is equal to `j`, and `j` is greater than or equal to the new value of `right` which equals to `j`, `left` is 0 since `j` is greater than the previous value of `right`**
