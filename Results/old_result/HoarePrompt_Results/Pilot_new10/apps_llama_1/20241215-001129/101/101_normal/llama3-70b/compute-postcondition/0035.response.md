To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement. 

The loop statement is `for j in range(m):`, which means the loop will execute for each value of `j` from 0 to `m-1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` has a certain value. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 

The state at the end of the previous iteration includes various variables, but the key variables that determine whether the loop can execute again are `j` and `m`. 

Since `j` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `m`. 

So, if at the end of the last iteration, `j` is some value, then at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be incremented by 1. 

Other variables like `n`, `m`, `pixels`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` do not directly affect whether the loop can execute again, but their values might change during the loop body execution based on the conditions provided.

State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 0`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w" or '+', `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, `min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, `max_x` is the largest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is the largest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and either (`i` equals the current value of `min_x` or `i` equals the current value of `max_x` or `j` equals the current value of `min_y` or `j` equals the current value of `max_y`) and at position `[i][j]` in `pixels` is '+', or (`pixels[i][j]` is 'w' and `(i, j)` is in `white_pixels`) or (`pixels[i][j]` is '.' and `i` is 0 and `j` is 0 and `pixels[0][0]` equals `'.'`), and `j` is incremented by 1**
