The given code updates the values of `max_x` and `max_y` to be the maximum of their current values and the x and y coordinates of the third 'w' pixel, respectively.

`max_x` is updated to `max(max_x, x)`, which means it will be equal to `x` if `x` is greater than the current `max_x`, otherwise, it will remain the same. 

`max_y` is updated to `max(max_y, y)`, which means it will be equal to `y` if `y` is greater than the current `max_y`, otherwise, it will remain the same.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels` that must have at least 3 coordinates, `min_x` is the minimum of the previous `min_x` and `x`, `min_y` is the minimum of the previous `min_y` and `y`, `max_x` is the maximum of the previous `max_x` and `x`, `max_y` is the maximum of the previous `max_y` and `y`, `x` is the x-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel, `y` is the y-coordinate of the third 'w' pixel**
