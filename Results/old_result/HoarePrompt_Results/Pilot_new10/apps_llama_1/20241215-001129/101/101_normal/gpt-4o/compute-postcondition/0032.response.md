Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters. If `j` is less than `left`, then if `i` is greater than `bottom`, `top` is `i`, `bottom` is `i`, `left` is 1, and `i` is 0, and if `j` > `right`, `right` is `j`, otherwise `right` retains its original value if `j` is not greater than `right`. If `j` is not less than `left`, then the original values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, `bottom`, `left`, and `i` are retained, and if `j` > `right`, `right` is `j`, otherwise `right` retains its original value if `j` is not greater than `right` and `j` is not less than `left`.**
