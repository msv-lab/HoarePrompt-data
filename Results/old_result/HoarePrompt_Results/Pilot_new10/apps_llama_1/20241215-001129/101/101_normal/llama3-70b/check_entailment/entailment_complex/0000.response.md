Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and follows the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Reading input**: The program correctly reads the monitor resolution (`n` and `m`) and the pixel data from the input.

2. **Identifying white pixels**: It identifies the coordinates of all white pixels (`'w'`) and stores them in the `white_pixels` list.

3. **Finding the bounding box**: The program calculates the minimum and maximum x and y coordinates (`min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y`) of the white pixels, which represents the bounding box around the white pixels.

4. **Calculating frame size**: It calculates the size of the frame (`frame_size`) by taking the maximum of the differences between `max_x` and `min_x` and `max_y` and `min_y`, and adding 1. This is the size of the square frame that can encompass all the white pixels.

5. **Checking frame size**: The program checks if the `frame_size` is within the monitor's dimensions. If it's not, it prints -1, indicating that the frame cannot be drawn within the monitor's boundaries.

6. **Drawing the frame**: If the `frame_size` is within the monitor's dimensions, the program draws the frame by replacing the black pixels (`'.'`) on the border of the bounding box with `'+'`. It leaves the white pixels (`'w'`) unchanged.

7. **Printing the output**: Finally, the program prints the modified pixel data with the frame around the white pixels.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* When there are multiple white pixels, it correctly identifies the bounding box and draws the frame.
* When the frame size is larger than the monitor's dimensions, it prints -1.
* When there is only one white pixel, it correctly draws a frame around it.

Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and is correct.
