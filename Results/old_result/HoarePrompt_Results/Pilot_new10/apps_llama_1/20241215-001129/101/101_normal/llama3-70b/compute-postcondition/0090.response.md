To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the given loop code. The loop iterates over each cell in the 2D list `pixels` of size `n x m`. It checks if the cell is on the border defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` and if its original value is `'.'`. If so, it updates the cell's value to `'+'`. If the cell's value is `'w'`, it remains unchanged. All other cells are updated to `'.'`.

Given the initial state and the output states after a few iterations, we can deduce the following:

- `n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, which does not change.
- `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where:
  - If a cell is on the border defined by the original `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` and its original value is `'.'`, then its value is updated to `'+'`.
  - If a cell's original value is `'w'`, it remains `'w'`.
  - All other cells are updated to `'.'`.
- `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, which does not change since `'w'` valued pixels remain unchanged.
- `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, respectively, which do not change.
- `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, respectively, which do not change.
- `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, which does not change.

The loop will execute `n * m` times in total, iterating over each cell in the `pixels` 2D list once. After all iterations, the values of `i` and `j` are not relevant as they are loop counters, and their final values will be `n` and `m-1`, respectively, but this is not part of the output state regarding the variables' lasting conditions.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished is described as follows:

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where if a cell is on the border defined by the original `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` and its original value is `'.'`, then its value is `'+'`, otherwise if its original value is `'w'`, it remains `'w'`, and all other cells are `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`.**
