The code assigns the value of `j` to `right`. Given that `j` is 1, `right` will also be 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 1, `top` is 1, `right` is 1**
