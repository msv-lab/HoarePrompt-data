Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not work as expected for all potential cases. The problem description requires that the frame must be a square, i.e., its width and height must be equal. However, the code does not check whether the width and height of the bounding box of the white pixels are equal, which is a necessary condition for the frame to be a square. If the width and height of the bounding box are not equal, the code will still print a frame that may not be a square.

For example, if the input is:
```
5 6
......
.w....
......
..w...
......
```
The bounding box of the white pixels will have a width of 3 and a height of 2, which cannot form a square frame. However, the code will still print a frame with a width of 3 and a height of 2, which is not a square.

To fix this issue, the code should check whether the width and height of the bounding box are equal, and if they are not, it should print -1, indicating that a square frame does not exist.

Additionally, the code does not follow all the requirements of the problem description. The description states that "of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size." However, the code does not check all possible frames that satisfy the conditions and does not guarantee that the frame it prints is the smallest one.

Therefore, the code does not work as expected for all potential cases and has a correctness of **False**.
