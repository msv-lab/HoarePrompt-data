The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there are no changes made to the variables before the `continue` statement, the values of all variables remain the same. The loop will move on to the next iteration.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n > i + 1`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 0`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where if a cell is on the border defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` and its original value is `'.'`, then its value is `'+'`, otherwise if its value is `'w'`, it remains `'w'`, and all other cells are `'.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `min_y` and `max_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer after the loop's execution context plus one, `j` is 0, and we move to the next iteration of the loop, skipping the rest of the code in the current iteration**
