Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`. If `j` is greater than `right`, then `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `bottom` is 1, `right` is 2, and if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` equals `j`. If `j` is not greater than `right`, then the state of the variables remains as initially described in the precondition, where if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `bottom` is 1, and if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` is equal to `j`, otherwise `left` is 2 if `i` is greater than `bottom`.***
