Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work as expected in the description for every potential case. The issue lies in the way it handles the minimum size requirement for the frame. The problem statement requires that the frame must have the smallest size possible, but the code does not check for this condition. 

In the provided code, once it finds the bounding box of all 'w' characters, it simply replaces the "." characters at the border positions of this box with "+". However, this approach may not always result in the smallest possible frame. 

For example, consider a screen with a single 'w' character in the middle. The code will correctly identify the bounding box as the entire screen, but it will not find a smaller frame (of size 1) that could potentially enclose this 'w' character.

Another issue is that the code does not correctly handle the case where the frame's width or height is less than 2. According to the problem description, if the height or width of the bounding box is less than 2, the function should return -1. However, the code only checks if the height or width is less than 2 after it has already found the bounding box, which could lead to incorrect results.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be modified to find the smallest possible frame that encloses all 'w' characters and to correctly handle the case where the frame's width or height is less than 2. 

Additionally, the code does not verify that all white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame as required by the problem description. This could lead to incorrect results if there are white pixels outside of the identified frame.

Overall, while the code is close to correct, it does not fully meet the requirements specified in the problem description, and therefore, its correctness is **False**.
