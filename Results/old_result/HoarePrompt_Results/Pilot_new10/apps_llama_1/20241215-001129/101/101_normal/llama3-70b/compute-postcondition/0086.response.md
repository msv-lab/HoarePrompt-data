The code changes the value of `pixels` at position `[i][j]` to `'.'`. Given the initial state of `pixels` as a 2D list where cells on the border defined by `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` and originally `'.'` are `'+'`, cells originally `'w'` remain `'w'`, and all other cells are `'.'`, the change at `pixels[i][j]` to `'.'` does not affect the definitions of `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, and `max_y` since `i` and `j` do not necessarily relate to the border conditions or the `'w'` valued pixels directly in this context.

The value of `i` is stated as the next integer after the loop's execution context plus one, and `j` is given as 2. However, without a specific loop context provided, `i`'s exact value is dependent on the loop it's associated with, but we know it's an integer and `n > i + 1`. 

Given `pixels` is of size `n x m`, and both `n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 2`, the assignment `pixels[i][j] = '.'` is within the bounds of the list since `j = 2` and `m > 2`, ensuring that index 2 is valid for the second dimension of `pixels`.

`frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, but this does not directly relate to the change in `pixels[i][j]`.

The states of `n`, `m`, `white_pixels`, `min_x`, `max_x`, `min_y`, `max_y`, and `frame_size` remain unchanged as the code snippet only alters the value of a specific cell in the `pixels` 2D list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000` and `n > i + 1`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 2`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` with `pixels[i][j] = '.'`, `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` and `max_x` are the smallest and largest x-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `max_y` and `min_y` are the smallest and largest y-coordinates in `white_pixels`, `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1` and is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, `i` is the next integer after the loop's execution context plus one, `j` is 2.**
