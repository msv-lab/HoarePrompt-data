The value of `top` is assigned the value of `i`, which is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `top` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 2, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `top` is 1**
