Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `top` plus two is less than `bottom`, `frame_height` and `frame_width` are at least 2, `result` is a 2D list of characters where all '.' characters at the border positions are replaced with '+', `i` is `top + 2`, `j` is `left + 2`, and if `result[i][j]` was '.' and `i` equals `top` or `i` equals `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right`, then `result[i][j]` is '+'. If `i` equals `top` or `i` equals `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right`, then `result[i][j]` is '+' regardless of its original value; otherwise, `result[i][j]` remains unchanged.***
