According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `white_pixels` list. If the list has at least 2 coordinates, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `white_pixels` has at least 1 coordinate, `(x, y)` is the first coordinate in the `white_pixels` list, `min_x` is `x`, `min_y` is `y`, `max_x` is `x`, `max_y` is `y`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 coordinates and `(x, y)` is the second coordinate in the `white_pixels` list.

State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels` that must have at least 2 coordinates, `min_x` is `x`, `min_y` is `y`, `max_x` is `x`, `max_y` is `y`, `(x, y)` is the second coordinate in the `white_pixels` list**
