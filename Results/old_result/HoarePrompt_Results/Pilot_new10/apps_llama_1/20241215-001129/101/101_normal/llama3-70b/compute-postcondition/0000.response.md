The values of `n` and `m` are assigned the values of the two integers from the input, which represent the resolution of the monitor. The input consists of a pair of integers `n` and `m`, where `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`. The rest of the input and the initial conditions about the pixels and their representation remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `m` are now known to be in the range `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are integers with `1 ≤ n, m ≤ 2000`, `n` and `m` represent the resolution of the monitor, `n` lines of `m` characters each are to be read, where "." represents a black pixel and "w" represents a white pixel, and at least one pixel of the monitor is white**
