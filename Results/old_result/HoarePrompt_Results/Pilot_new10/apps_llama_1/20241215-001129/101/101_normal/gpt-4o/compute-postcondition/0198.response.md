According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `left`, and `right`. If `j` is less than `right`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `left + 1`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is `left + 2`. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `left` is less than or equal to `right`, `top` plus two is less than `bottom`, `frame_height` and `frame_width` are at least 2, `result` is a 2D list of characters where all '.' characters at the border positions are replaced with '+', `i` is `top + 2`, `j` is `left + 2`, and if `result[i][j]` was '.' and `i` equals `top` or `i` equals `bottom` or `j` equals `left` or `j` equals `right`, then `result[i][j]` is '+'**
