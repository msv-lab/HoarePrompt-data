According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `left` and `right`. If `left` is less than or equal to `right`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted to ensure that this condition is met. 

Additionally, the state of `j` needs to be adjusted to be equal to `left` because that's where the loop will start. Since `i` is already defined as `top + 1`, its state is already adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `left` must be less than or equal to `right`, `top` plus one must be less than or equal to `bottom`, `frame_height` and `frame_width` are at least 2, `result` is a 2D list of characters, `i` is `top + 1`, `j` is `left`**
