According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the given state already includes `n` as an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, which ensures that the loop will execute at least once. Additionally, `i` is the loop variable, and it needs to be initialized before the loop starts.

State: **`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w", `white_pixels` is a list of coordinates of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`, `min_x` is the smallest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, `min_y` is the smallest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('inf')`, `max_x` is the largest x-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, `max_y` is the largest y-coordinate in `white_pixels` if it is not empty, otherwise `float('-inf')`, `frame_size` is equal to `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, `frame_size` is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`, and `i` is 0**
