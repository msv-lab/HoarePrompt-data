The code assigns the value of `j` to both `left` and `right`. Given that `j` is 0, `left` and `right` will both be assigned the value 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `i` is 1, `j` is 0, `top` is 1, `bottom` is 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, and `screen[i][j]` is 'w'**
