Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the fact that the program simply finds the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all 'w' characters in the screen and then draws a frame around these indices. However, this does not guarantee that the frame will have the smallest size possible.

According to the problem description, the program should find a square frame that satisfies the following conditions:

1. The frame's width is 1 pixel.
2. The frame doesn't go beyond the borders of the screen.
3. All white pixels of the monitor are located on the frame.
4. Of all frames that satisfy the previous three conditions, the required frame must have the smallest size.

The program does not check if the frame is a square, nor does it try to find the smallest possible square frame that satisfies the conditions. It simply draws a rectangle around the minimum and maximum row and column indices of all 'w' characters, which may not be the smallest possible square frame.

For example, consider the following input:

```
6 6
......
......
.w....
......
......
......
```

The program will draw a frame around the 'w' character, but this frame will not be a square. A smaller square frame that satisfies the conditions is possible, but the program will not find it.

Therefore, the program does not always follow the problem description, and its correctness is **False**.
