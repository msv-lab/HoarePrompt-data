Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer with `1 ≤ n ≤ 2000`, `m` is an integer with `1 ≤ m ≤ 2000` and `m > 0`, `pixels` is a 2D list of size `n x m` where each element is either "." or "w". If `pixels[i][j]` is 'w', then `(i, j)` is in `white_pixels`, and we continue to the next iteration of the most internal loop, with `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` being the smallest and largest x and y coordinates in `white_pixels` respectively, and `frame_size` equals `max(max_x - min_x, max_y - min_y) + 1`, which is less than or equal to the maximum of `n` and `m`. If `pixels[i][j]` is '.', then `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `pixels[0][0]` equals `'.'`, with `min_x`, `min_y`, `max_x`, `max_y` and `frame_size` updated accordingly based on the presence of 'w' valued pixels in `pixels`.***
