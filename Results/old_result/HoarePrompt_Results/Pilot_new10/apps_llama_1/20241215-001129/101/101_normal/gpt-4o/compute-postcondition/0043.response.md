Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, if `j` is less than `left`, then `left` equals `j`. Regardless of the condition, if `i` is less than `top`, then `top` equals `i`, and if `i` is greater than `bottom`, then `bottom` equals `i`.**
