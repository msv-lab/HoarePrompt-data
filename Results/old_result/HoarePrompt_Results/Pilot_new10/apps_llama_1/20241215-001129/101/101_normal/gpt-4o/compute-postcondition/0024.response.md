The code sets `left` and `right` to the value of `j`. The values of `n`, `m`, `screen`, `top`, and `bottom` are not changed. The new values of `left` and `right` are equal to `j`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, where each string consists of only "." and "w" characters, `top` is equal to `i`, `bottom` is equal to `i`, `left` is equal to `j`, `right` is equal to `j**, and if `screen[i][j]` is 'w', then the other conditions based on the original values still apply**
