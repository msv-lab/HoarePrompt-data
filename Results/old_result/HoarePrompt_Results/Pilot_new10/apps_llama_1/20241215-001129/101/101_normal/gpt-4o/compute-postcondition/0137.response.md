Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer greater than 1, `screen` is a list of strings of length `m`, `j` equals 2, `left` equals 1, `right` equals 1. If `i` is less than `top`, then `i` equals 2. If `i` > `bottom`, then `bottom` equals `i` (which could be 2 if `i` is less than `top`, or its original value if `i` is not less than `top`), otherwise, no changes are made to `bottom` since there is no else part to handle the condition when `i` is not greater than `bottom`.***
