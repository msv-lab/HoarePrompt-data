Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly in all cases. It only finds the bounding box of all 'w' pixels, but it does not ensure that all 'w' pixels are on the border of this box, which is one of the requirements of the problem.

For example, consider a screen with a single row:

ww..ww

In this case, the program will output:

ww..ww

which does not satisfy the condition that all 'w' pixels should be on the border of the box.

The correct output should be -1 in this case, as there is no possible square frame that satisfies all the conditions. However, the program does not handle this case correctly. 

Another case where the program does not work correctly is when all 'w' pixels are not part of a square frame, for example:

w
.w
..

In this case, the program should return -1, but it will return a frame that does not contain all 'w' pixels on its border.

To fix these issues, the program needs to be modified to check if all 'w' pixels are on the border of the box, and if not, return -1. Additionally, it needs to be modified to handle cases where all 'w' pixels are not part of a square frame.
