The function `func_1` accepts an integer `x` where `1 ≤ x ≤ 1000`. The function checks if `x` is likely a prime number or not. Here is a step-by-step breakdown:

- If `x` is less than or equal to 1, the function immediately returns `False`.
- If `x` is less than or equal to 3, the function returns `True` because 2 and 3 are prime numbers.
- If `x` is divisible by 2 or 3, the function returns `False` because `x` is not a prime number.
- For `x` greater than 3, the function checks divisibility by numbers of the form `6k ± 1` (starting from 5), which is a common optimization for prime checking. If `x` is divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns `False`.
- If `x` passes all these checks without returning `False`, the function returns `True`, indicating that `x` is likely a prime number.

However, upon examining the code closely, it appears to accurately implement a prime-checking algorithm for the specified range. There are no obvious missing edge cases or functionalities that the code does not cover based on the provided annotations and return postconditions.

Functionality: ** The function checks if a given integer `x`, where `1 ≤ x ≤ 1000`, is likely a prime number and returns a boolean value indicating whether `x` is prime or not, with specific optimizations for divisibility checks. **
