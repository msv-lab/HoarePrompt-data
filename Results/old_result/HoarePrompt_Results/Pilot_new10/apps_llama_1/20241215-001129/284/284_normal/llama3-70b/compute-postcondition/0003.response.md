According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `num` must be greater than or equal to 4, because the square root of `num` must be at least 2. If `num` is less than 4, the loop will not execute because the range will be empty. 

Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined, but for the loop to execute, `i` should be initialized to 2, which is the start of the range. 

State: **`num` is an integer such that 4 <= num <= 1000, `i` is 2**
