Postcondition: ***`x` is an odd integer such that `144 ≤ x ≤ 997`, `x` is not divisible by `2`, `3`, `5`, or `7`. If `x` is divisible by `i` or `i + 2`, the program returns False. Otherwise, the program continues execution, maintaining the condition that after increasing `i` by 6, `i` squared must be less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is not divisible by `11` or `13`, in which case the program would have returned False.***
