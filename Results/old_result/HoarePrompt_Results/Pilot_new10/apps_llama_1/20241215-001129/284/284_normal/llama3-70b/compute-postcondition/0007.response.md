According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `num`. The loop iterates over the range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `num` is an odd number between 4 and 1000 (inclusive) such that `num` % `i`!= 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1. So, `i` becomes 3. 

The condition `num` % `i`!= 0 still applies. Since `i` is now 3, `num` must not be divisible by 3. The range of `num` remains the same (4 <= `num` <= 1000), but `num` must be an odd number that is not divisible by 3.

State: **`num` is an odd integer between 4 and 1000 that is not divisible by 2 or 3, `i` is 3**
