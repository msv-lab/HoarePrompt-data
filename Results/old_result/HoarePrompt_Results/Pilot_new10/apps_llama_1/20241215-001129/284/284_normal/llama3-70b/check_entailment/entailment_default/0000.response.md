Correctness: **True**

The provided code indeed finds a counterexample for PolandBall's hypothesis. The function `func_1(num)` checks whether a number is prime or not by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient approach. The main part of the code iterates through possible values of `m` and checks whether `n*m + 1` is prime using the `func_1` function. As soon as it finds an `m` for which `n*m + 1` is not prime, it prints that `m` and breaks the loop.

The code correctly implements the problem description. It finds a counterexample for any given `n` by checking numbers of the form `n*m + 1` for primality and outputs the first `m` for which `n*m + 1` is not a prime number.

The output hints agree with the code's functionality, indicating that the `func_1` function correctly identifies prime numbers. Given the examples provided with the problem description, the code produces the expected output. For instance, for `n = 3`, it outputs `1` because `3*1 + 1 = 4` is not prime, and for `n = 4`, it outputs `2` because `4*2 + 1 = 9` is not prime.

Overall, the code seems to correctly implement the problem's requirements and should work for all valid inputs.
