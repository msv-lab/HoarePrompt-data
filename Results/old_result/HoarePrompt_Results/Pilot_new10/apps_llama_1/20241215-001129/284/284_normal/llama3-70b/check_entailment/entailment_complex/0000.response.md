Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it meets all the requirements stated in the problem description. 

Here's why it always does what the problem description says:

1. The problem requires finding a counterexample for any given `n` such that `n*m + 1` is not a prime number for some `m`.
2. The program iterates over all possible `m` values from 1 to 1000, checking if `n*m + 1` is a prime number using the function `func_1`.
3. The function `func_1` checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient method for prime checking within the given range.
4. If `func_1` returns `False` for any `m`, the program prints the corresponding `m` value and stops, thus providing a counterexample to PolandBall's hypothesis.
5. The function `func_1` correctly handles edge cases, such as numbers less than 2, which are not prime by definition.
6. The program guarantees that a counterexample will be found within the given range of `m` values (1 to 1000), as stated in the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality, following the problem description and ensuring that a counterexample is found for any given `n`.
