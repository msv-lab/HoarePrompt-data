To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given `while` loop condition: `i * i <= x`.

Given that `i` is `11` at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that the condition `i * i <= x` is still met for the next iteration. This means `11 * 11 <= x` must be true for the loop to execute again.

Since `11 * 11 = 121`, `x` must be greater than or equal to `121` for the loop to potentially execute again. However, we also know that `x` is a positive odd integer such that `25 ≤ x ≤ 997`, and it is not divisible by `2`, `3`, `5`, or `7`.

For the loop to execute one more time, given that `i` will increment, the next value of `i` will be `12`. Therefore, we need `12 * 12 <= x` to be true for the loop to execute again. This means `144 <= x`.

Considering the constraints on `x` and the requirement for the loop to execute one more time, `x` must be an odd integer greater than or equal to `144` but still within the range `25 ≤ x ≤ 997`, and not divisible by `2`, `3`, `5`, or `7`.

State: **`x` is an odd integer such that `144 ≤ x ≤ 997`, `x` is not divisible by `2` or `3`, `x` is not divisible by `5` or `7`, and `i` is `11`**
