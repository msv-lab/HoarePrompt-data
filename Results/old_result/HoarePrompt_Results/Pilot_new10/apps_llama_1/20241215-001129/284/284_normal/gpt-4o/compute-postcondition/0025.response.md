The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `x`, where `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000. After executing the function body, the function returns a boolean value based on the following conditions: 

Case_1 to Case_6 are related to False return values but the conditions are not clearly defined in the problem description. 
However, Case_7 suggests that if `x` passes all divisibility checks (not divisible by 2, 3, 5, or 7, and likely other checks related to prime numbers given the context of checking up to the square root of `x`), it returns True, indicating `x` is likely a prime number.

Given this information, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept an integer `x` and return a boolean value indicating whether `x` is likely a prime number or not, based on the outcome of a series of divisibility checks.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer x, where 1 ≤ x ≤ 1000, and returns a boolean value indicating whether x is likely a prime number or not.**
