Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the logic to find a counterexample for the PolandBall's hypothesis. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The code takes an input `n` from the user and iterates over all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000.
2. For each `m`, it checks if `n*m + 1` is a prime number using the `func_1` function.
3. The `func_1` function checks if a number is prime by iterating up to the square root of the number and checking for any divisors.
4. If `n*m + 1` is not a prime number, the code prints the value of `m` and breaks out of the loop.

The code correctly handles all potential cases:

- It checks all possible values of `m` from 1 to 1000, ensuring that it will find a counterexample if one exists.
- The `func_1` function correctly checks if a number is prime by testing all possible divisors up to the square root of the number.
- The code follows the problem description and examples provided, correctly outputting a value of `m` for which `n*m + 1` is not a prime number.

The output hints also agree with the code, describing the behavior of the `func_1` function and providing examples of the code's output.

Overall, the code is correct and will produce the expected output for all valid inputs.
