Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code provided does not correctly follow the problem description. In the code, the function `func_1(x)` is defined after it is being used in the main part of the program. This will cause a `NameError` because `func_1` is not defined when it is first called. 

To fix this issue, the function `func_1(x)` should be defined before the main part of the code where it is used. Also, ensure that the code correctly handles all potential cases as per the problem description. 

For example, given the input `n = 3`, the code should output `1` because `3*1 + 1 = 4`, which is not a prime number. Similarly, for `n = 4`, the code should output `2` because `4*2 + 1 = 9`, which is not a prime number. 

However, due to the incorrect placement of the function definition, the code will not work correctly for any input. Therefore, the Correctness is **False**. 

The correct code should be:
```python
def func_1(x):
    if x <= 1:
        return False
    if x <= 3:
        return True
    if x % 2 == 0 or x % 3 == 0:
        return False
    i = 5
    while i * i <= x:
        if x % i == 0 or x % (i + 2) == 0:
            return False
        i += 6
    return True

n = int(input())
for m in range(1, 1001):
    if not func_1(n * m + 1):
        print(m)
        break
```
