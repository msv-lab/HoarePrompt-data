The code snippet provided takes an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. Given the initial state that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18, we can deduce that the input to the program will be within this range.

Since the input is directly assigned to `n`, the range of `n` remains the same as specified in the initial state. The code doesn't perform any operations on `n` beyond assigning the input value to it.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 10^18, representing the number of players participating in the tournament, and its value is the input integer.**
