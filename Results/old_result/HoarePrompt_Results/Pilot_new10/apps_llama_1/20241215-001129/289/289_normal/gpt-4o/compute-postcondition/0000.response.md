The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input converted to an integer to `n`. The initial state specified that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, but this information is overwritten by the new value of `n` from the input. 

The value of `n` after executing the code is an integer input by the user. The precondition that `n` is an integer is still valid, but the condition that `n` is greater than or equal to 2 may not hold after the execution, depending on the user's input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
