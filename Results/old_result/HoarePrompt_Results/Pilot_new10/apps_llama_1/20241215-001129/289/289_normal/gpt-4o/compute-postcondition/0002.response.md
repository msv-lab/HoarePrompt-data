The code prints the value of `max_games`, which is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and the `bit_length()` function returns the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary. 

The `print` statement does not change the values of any variables, it simply outputs the value of `max_games` to the console. Therefore, the values of `n` and `max_games` remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `max_games` equals `n.bit_length() - 1` and the value of `max_games` has been printed.**
