Correctness: **True**

The given program appears to be correct based on the provided problem description. It correctly calculates the sum of all f(i) for i from 0 to m, where f(x) is the number of distinct integers the frog can reach if it never jumps on an integer outside the interval [0, x].

The program first calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b using the func_1 function. If the GCD is not 1, it recursively calls the func_2 function with a, b, and m divided by the GCD. This is a valid optimization, as the GCD represents the minimum step size the frog can take.

If the GCD is 1, the program calculates the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to m. It first calculates the sum of f(i) for i from 0 to k (where k = a + b - 1), which is the sum of the first k+1 integers. If m is less than k, it returns this sum. Otherwise, it calculates the sum of f(i) for i from k+1 to m, which is the sum of the first m+1 integers minus the sum of the first k integers.

The program handles all the provided examples correctly, and it does not seem to have any obvious errors or edge cases that it does not handle. Therefore, based on the provided information, the program appears to be correct.

The logic of the program seems to be based on the following principles:

1. When the GCD of a and b is 1, the frog can reach all integers in the interval [0, m] if and only if m is greater than or equal to a + b - 1.
2. When the GCD of a and b is greater than 1, the frog can only reach integers that are multiples of the GCD.
3. The number of distinct integers the frog can reach is equal to the sum of the first m+1 integers if m is greater than or equal to a + b - 1, and is equal to the sum of the first k+1 integers otherwise.

The program correctly implements these principles, and it handles all the provided examples correctly. Therefore, based on the provided information, the program appears to be correct.
