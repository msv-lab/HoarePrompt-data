Correctness: **False**

The given program has a bug. The main issue with the program is that it doesn't correctly calculate the number of distinct integers the frog can reach without jumping outside the interval [0, x]. 

Let's consider an example where m = 7, a = 5, and b = 3. The program will calculate dp[5] by adding dp[0] to dp[5], but it will also calculate dp[2] by adding dp[-1 + 2] (which is dp[1] after adjusting the index) to dp[2] in the next iteration. However, dp[-1] or dp[1] in this case, is not necessarily the correct value because dp[1] can be reached from dp[-2 + 2] (dp[-2] after adjusting the index, but this index is out of bounds and should be 0), and then from dp[3] after the first jump.

However, there's an even simpler example that can be used to demonstrate that the code is incorrect. Consider m = 6, a = 4, b = 5. In this case, the frog can only jump from position 0 to 4 and then from position 4 to -1. The frog cannot jump from 0 to any position between 1 and 3 (inclusive) because the only jump available is a jump of size 4, which would put the frog outside the allowed interval if it starts at any position between 1 and 3. However, the code will still increment dp[4] and then dp[0] because the condition i - b >= 0 will be met for i = 4. This means the value of dp[0] will be greater than 1, which is incorrect.

In other words, the issue with the given code is that the update rules for dp[i] and dp[i + a] are not correct. The update rules should ensure that the frog does not jump outside the allowed interval [0, i] when calculating dp[i]. The current rules do not guarantee this, which means the code can produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

The problem requires a more complex solution that takes into account the specific jump rules for the frog and ensures that the frog does not jump outside the allowed interval [0, x]. 

However, the given program fails to handle these rules correctly and therefore can produce incorrect results for certain inputs.
