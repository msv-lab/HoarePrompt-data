Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code initially seems to do what the problem description says. The function `func_2(m, a, b)` correctly calculates the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`. 

The function `func_1(x, y)` calculates the greatest common divisor of `x` and `y` using the Euclidean algorithm. The output hints for `func_1` mention that it handles all potential cases except when both `x` and `y` are zero, in which case it returns `0`. However, in the context of the problem, `a` and `b` are positive integers, so this exception does not apply.

The function `func_2(m, a, b)` first calculates the greatest common divisor `g` of `a` and `b` using `func_1(a, b)`. If `g` is not equal to `1`, it recursively calls itself with `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g`, and multiplies the result by `g`. This is correct because if the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` is `g`, then the frog can only reach positions that are multiples of `g`.

If `g` is equal to `1`, then `func_2(m, a, b)` calculates the sum of `f(i)` for `i` from `0` to `m`. It first calculates `k = a + b - 1`. If `m` is less than `k`, then the frog can only reach positions from `0` to `m`, so the sum is `(m + 1) * (m + 2) // 2`. If `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, then the sum is divided into two parts: `sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2` and `sum_m = m * (m + 1) // 2 - k * (k - 1) // 2`. The total sum is `sum_k + sum_m`.

The output hints for `func_2` agree with the code, and the examples provided in the problem description match the output of the code. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
