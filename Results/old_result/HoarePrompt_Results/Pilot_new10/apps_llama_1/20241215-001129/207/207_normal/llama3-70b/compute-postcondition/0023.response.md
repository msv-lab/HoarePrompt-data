The function `func` accepts three integer parameters `m`, `a`, and `b` as input from the user, where `1 <= m <= 10^9` and `1 <= a, b <= 10^5`. 

After analyzing the code line by line, the function initializes a list `dp` of size `m + 1` with all elements set to 0, except for `dp[0]` which is set to 1. It then iterates over the range from 0 to `m` (inclusive). 

For each index `i`, if `i + a` is less than or equal to `m`, it increments `dp[i + a]` by `dp[i]`. If `i - b` is greater than or equal to 0, it increments `dp[i]` by `dp[i - b]`. 

This process updates the `dp` list based on the values of `a` and `b`. 

Finally, the function prints the sum of all elements in the `dp` list.

Given the code's logic, the functionality does not directly depend on the input validation or error handling for cases where `m`, `a`, or `b` are outside their specified ranges or are non-integer values, as the code does not explicitly handle these scenarios. However, it does process the inputs according to the described dynamic programming approach, regardless of the input values.

Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer parameters `m`, `a`, and `b` as input from the user, initializes a dynamic programming list `dp` of size `m + 1`, updates `dp` based on `a` and `b`, and prints the sum of all elements in `dp`, effectively calculating and returning the sum of all reachable states in a sequence defined by `m`, `a`, and `b`. **
