The value of `dp[i + a]` is incremented by the value of `dp[i]`. The initial state specifies that `dp[0]` is 1 and the rest are zeros, and `i` is 0. Since `dp[i]` is `dp[0]` which is 1, `dp[i + a]` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is 1, and the rest of `dp` are zeros except for possibly `dp[a]` which is now 1 and `dp[0]`, `i` is 0.

Output State: **`m` is an input integer that must be greater than or equal to 0, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `dp` is a list of `m + 1` elements where `dp[0]` is 1, `dp[a]` is 1 and the rest are zeros except for `dp[0]` and `dp[a]`, `i` is 0**
