To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the code on the program. The given code snippet is `g = func_1(a, b)`, where `func_1` is a function that takes two arguments, `a` and `b`, and returns a value that is assigned to `g`. 

Given the initial state: `m` is a non-negative integer, and `a` and `b` are positive integers.

Since the function `func_1(a, b)` is not defined in the problem, we cannot determine the exact value or nature of `g` without knowing what `func_1` does. However, we can say that `g` will be assigned the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, whatever that may be.

The states of `m`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by this code snippet because it does not modify them; it only introduces a new variable `g`.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged conditions for `m`, `a`, and `b`, and the new information about `g`:

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `a` and `b` are positive integers, and `g` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`**
