To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `m` is a non-negative integer.
- `a` and `b` are positive integers.
- `g` is the return value of `func_1(a, b)`, and `g` is not equal to 1.

The code snippet to execute is:
```python
return func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) * g
```

Here's the step-by-step analysis:
1. `m // g`: This operation performs integer division of `m` by `g`. Since `m` is a non-negative integer and `g` is not equal to 1 (and implicitly is an integer because it's the result of `func_1(a, b)`), the result of `m // g` will be an integer. The exact value depends on `m` and `g`.
2. `a // g` and `b // g`: Similar to `m // g`, these operations perform integer division of `a` and `b` by `g`, respectively. Given `a` and `b` are positive integers, the results of these divisions will be integers. Again, the exact values depend on `a`, `b`, and `g`.
3. `func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g)`: This function call takes the results of the integer divisions as arguments. Without the definition of `func_2`, we can't determine its return value directly. However, we know it returns some value based on the inputs `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g`.
4. The return value of `func_2` is then multiplied by `g`. Since `g` is an integer (not equal to 1) and is the result of `func_1(a, b)`, multiplying the result of `func_2` by `g` will scale the result of `func_2` by a factor of `g`.

Considering all the provided information, the program returns the result of `func_2` (with arguments `m // g`, `a // g`, and `b // g`) scaled by `g`, where `g` is the non-1 integer return value of `func_1(a, b)`, `m` is a non-negative integer, and `a` and `b` are positive integers.

Output State: **The program returns the result of func_2(m // g, a // g, b // g) multiplied by g, where m is a non-negative integer, a and b are positive integers, and g is the return value of func_1(a, b) not equal to 1.**
