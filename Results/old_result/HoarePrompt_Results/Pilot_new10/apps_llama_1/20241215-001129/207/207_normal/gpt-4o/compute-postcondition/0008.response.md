To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

Given the initial state: 
- `m` is a non-negative integer, 
- `a` and `b` are positive integers, 
- `g` is equal to 1, 
- `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, 
- `m` is greater than or equal to `k`.

The code is: 
```python
sum_k = k * (k + 1) // 2
```

This line of code calculates the sum of the first `k` positive integers using the formula for the sum of an arithmetic series, `n * (n + 1) / 2`, where `n` is the number of terms in the series. In this case, `n` is replaced with `k`.

Given that `k = a + b - 1`, we substitute `k` in the formula to get `sum_k` as:
```python
sum_k = (a + b - 1) * ((a + b - 1) + 1) // 2
```
Simplifying, we get:
```python
sum_k = (a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2
```

The states of `m`, `a`, `b`, and `g` are not affected by this operation. The value of `k` is also not changed, as it is used in the calculation but not reassigned. 

Therefore, the output state includes the new variable `sum_k` with its calculated value, and the unchanged states of the other variables.

Output State: **`m` is a non-negative integer, `m` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` and `b` are positive integers, `g` is equal to 1, `k` is equal to `a + b - 1`, and `sum_k` is equal to `(a + b - 1) * (a + b) // 2`.**
