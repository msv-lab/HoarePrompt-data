To determine the correctness of the given Python program, let's analyze it step by step according to the problem description.

### Problem Description Analysis

The problem describes a scenario where `n` spectators are standing in a line, and they start a Mexican wave at time 0. The wave progresses such that at time `t`, `t` spectators are standing if `t <= k`, where `k` is the number of spectators that stand before the first spectator sits down. After time `k`, the first spectator sits down, and so on.

### Code Analysis

The provided code is:

```python
def func():
    n, k, t = map(int, input().split())
    print(min(t, k) if t <= n else k - (t - n) % k)
```

### Explanation of Code Correctness

1. **Input Handling**: The code correctly takes input for `n`, `k`, and `t` and assigns them as integers.
2. **Condition for `t <= n`**: The expression `min(t, k)` correctly calculates the number of standing spectators when `t <= k`. However, the condition should ideally check `t <= k` instead of `t <= n` to accurately reflect the problem description's first phase where spectators stand up. But, since `k <= n`, `min(t, k)` works as expected for `t <= n` because it will be `t` when `t < k` and `k` when `t >= k` (in the range where `t <= n`).
3. **Condition for `t > n`**: When `t > n`, the expression `k - (t - n) % k` calculates the number of spectators standing. This is because once all `n` spectators have stood (which happens at time `n`), every `k` time units, one more spectator sits down (because a new one stands up and an old one sits down, effectively reducing the standing count by 1 every `k` time units after `n`).

However, there's an oversight in the original analysis regarding the condition `t <= n` in the code. The logic `min(t, k) if t <= n` actually works because it ensures that if `t` is less than or equal to `n`, the minimum between `t` and `k` gives the correct number of spectators standing, aligning with the problem description's progression.

### Correctness Evaluation

The code is **correct** because it accurately models the behavior described in the problem statement. For `t <= n`, it correctly returns the minimum of `t` and `k`, which corresponds to the number of spectators standing in the initial phase. For `t > n`, it correctly calculates `k - (t - n) % k`, which accounts for the spectators sitting down after all have stood up.

The code's logic might seem counterintuitive at first glance due to the `t <= n` condition, but given the constraints and the problem's nature, it efficiently computes the number of standing spectators at any given time `t`.

Correctness: **True**
