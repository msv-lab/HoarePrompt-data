Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description for every potential case.

1. If `t` is less than or equal to `k`, the program prints `t`, which is correct because at time `t`, the first `t` spectators are standing.
2. If `t` is larger than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the program prints `k`, which is correct because at time `t`, the first `k` spectators are standing (the first `t-k` spectators have stood and then sat back down).
3. If `t` is larger than `n`, the program prints `n + k - t`, which is correct because at time `t`, `t-n` spectators have sat back down after standing, so the number of standing spectators is `k - (t-n)`.

The program's logic is sound, and it handles all three cases correctly. The variable name `func` is not very descriptive, but this is a minor point and does not affect the correctness of the program.

Here is why it always does what the problem description says:

- When `t` is less than or equal to `k`, it simply prints `t`. This matches the problem description because for `t` between 1 and `k` (inclusive), `t` spectators will be standing at time `t`.

- When `t` is greater than `k` but less than or equal to `n`, the function prints `k`. This is correct because from time `k` to `n`, every spectator in the first `k` seats (from 1 to `k` spectators) is standing while other spectators start standing and then sitting down.

- When `t` is greater than `n` but less than `n + k`, the function prints `n + k - t`. This is correct because for every time unit that `t` increases beyond `n`, the number of standing spectators decreases by 1.

Overall, the program's logic accurately implements the rules of the Mexican wave problem, making it correct according to the problem description.
