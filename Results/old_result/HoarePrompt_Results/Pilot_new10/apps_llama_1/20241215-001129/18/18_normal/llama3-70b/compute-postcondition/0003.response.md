The function `func` accepts three integer parameters `n`, `k`, and `t` through the `input()` function, where `n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that `1 <= n <= 10^9`, `1 <= k <= n`, and `1 <= t < n + k`. 

Looking at the code, it calculates and prints the minimum of `t` and `k` if `t` is less than or equal to `n`. If `t` is greater than `n`, it calculates and prints `k - (t - n) % k`. This suggests that the function is designed to compute a value based on the given input conditions.

However, there are a few potential edge cases to consider:
1. If `t` is exactly equal to `n`, the function will print the minimum of `t` and `k`, which could be either `t` or `k` depending on their values.
2. If `t` is greater than `n`, the function will calculate `k - (t - n) % k`, which could potentially result in a negative value if `(t - n) % k` is greater than `k`. However, since `(t - n) % k` is the remainder of the division of `(t - n)` by `k`, it will always be less than `k`, so this case will not result in a negative value.

Considering these cases, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer parameters `n`, `k`, and `t` and prints the minimum of `t` and `k` if `t` is less than or equal to `n`, or `k - (t - n) % k` if `t` is greater than `n`, where `n`, `k`, and `t` are integers such that `1 <= n <= 10^9`, `1 <= k <= n`, and `1 <= t < n + k`. **
