Correctness: **True**

The program provided is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. For `t <= n`, the program prints `min(t, k)`. This is correct because at time `t`, the number of standing spectators is equal to the minimum of `t` and `k`. If `t` is less than `k`, then only `t` spectators are standing. If `t` is greater than or equal to `k`, then `k` spectators are standing.

2. For `t > n`, the program prints `k - (t - n) % k`. This is correct because at time `t`, the number of standing spectators is equal to `k` minus the remainder of `(t - n)` divided by `k`. This remainder represents the number of spectators that have started sitting, which reduces the number of standing spectators.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including the edge cases where `t` is equal to `n` or `n + k`. The examples provided also demonstrate the correctness of the program.

Overall, the program is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
