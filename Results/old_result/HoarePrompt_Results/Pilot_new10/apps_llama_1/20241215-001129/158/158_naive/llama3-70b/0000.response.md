Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used to cook the compote according to the given ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's why:

* The program takes the minimum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used according to the ratio by using the `min()` function. 
* It calculates this minimum number by comparing the number of lemons (`a`), the number of apples divided by 2 (`b // 2`), and the number of pears divided by 4 (`c // 4`).
* It then calculates the total number of fruits that can be used by multiplying the minimum number of lemons by 1 (for lemons), 2 (for apples), and 4 (for pears), and adding them together.
* This approach ensures that the program uses the maximum number of fruits possible while still maintaining the required ratio.

The program handles all possible cases, including when there are not enough fruits to cook any compote, in which case it correctly outputs 0. 

The examples provided also demonstrate the correctness of the program. 

Therefore, the program is correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem.
