You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nikolay has a lemons, b apples and c pears. He decided to cook a compote. According to the recipe the fruits should be in the ratio 1: 2: 4. It means that for each lemon in the compote should be exactly 2 apples and exactly 4 pears. You can't crumble up, break up or cut these fruits into pieces. These fruits — lemons, apples and pears — should be put in the compote as whole fruits.

Your task is to determine the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It is possible that Nikolay can't use any fruits, in this case print 0. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000) — the number of lemons Nikolay has. 

The second line contains the positive integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000) — the number of apples Nikolay has. 

The third line contains the positive integer c (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000) — the number of pears Nikolay has.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum total number of lemons, apples and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote.


-----Examples-----
Input
2
5
7

Output
7

Input
4
7
13

Output
21

Input
2
3
2

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example Nikolay can use 1 lemon, 2 apples and 4 pears, so the answer is 1 + 2 + 4 = 7.

In the second example Nikolay can use 3 lemons, 6 apples and 12 pears, so the answer is 3 + 6 + 12 = 21.

In the third example Nikolay don't have enough pears to cook any compote, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used while maintaining the required ratio of 1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. This is achieved by using the `min` function to find the smallest whole number of lemons that can be used, considering the available number of lemons, apples, and pears.

The program works as follows:

- Reads the number of lemons `a`, apples `b`, and pears `c` as input.
- Calculates the minimum number of whole lemons that can be used while maintaining the required ratio. This is done by comparing the available number of lemons `a` with the number of apples `b` divided by 2 and the number of pears `c` divided by 4. The smallest of these values is selected using the `min` function.
- Prints the total number of fruits that can be used, which is the minimum number of lemons `min_lemon` plus twice that number of apples `min_lemon * 2` plus four times that number of pears `min_lemon * 4`.

The provided examples demonstrate the correctness of the program:

- For input (2, 5, 7), the output is 7, which corresponds to using 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears.
- For input (4, 7, 13), the output is 21, which corresponds to using 3 lemons, 6 apples, and 12 pears.
- For input (2, 3, 2), the output is 0, which means that Nikolay cannot use any fruits to cook the compote because there are not enough pears.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, as it takes into account the minimum number of whole lemons that can be used while maintaining the required ratio of fruits. Therefore, the Correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: the input variables are three positive integers a, b, and c, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, such that 1 <= a <= 1000, 1 <= b <= 1000, and 1 <= c <= 1000. The ratio of lemons, apples, and pears is 1:2:4.
def func():
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    c = int(input())
    min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
    print(min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, calculates the minimum number of complete sets of fruits that can be formed, and prints the total number of fruits in these sets, without enforcing the 1:2:4 ratio or handling invalid inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
