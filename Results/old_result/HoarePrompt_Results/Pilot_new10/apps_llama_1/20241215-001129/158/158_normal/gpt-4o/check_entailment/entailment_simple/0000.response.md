Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and meets the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program first reads the number of lemons, apples, and pears from the input, which is in line with the problem description.

2. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote. To do this, it finds the minimum of three values: the total number of lemons `a`, the total number of apples divided by 2 `b // 2` (since each lemon requires 2 apples), and the total number of pears divided by 4 `c // 4` (since each lemon requires 4 pears). This ensures that the program uses the maximum number of lemons that can be used without exceeding the available number of apples or pears.

3. Finally, it calculates the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote by multiplying the maximum number of lemons by 7 (1 lemon + 2 apples + 4 pears), and prints this value.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

* If there are not enough apples or pears to match the number of lemons, the program will limit the number of lemons used to the minimum required by the available apples or pears.
* If there are not enough lemons to match the available apples or pears, the program will use all the available lemons.
* If there are not enough fruits to cook any compote (i.e., the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` is 0), the program will print 0, which is the correct output.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description and will produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
