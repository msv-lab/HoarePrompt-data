Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to be correct for every potential case. It reads the input numbers of lemons, apples, and pears, calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the minimum of the available lemons, available apples divided by 2, and available pears divided by 4. Then, it calculates the total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote by multiplying the maximum number of lemons by the respective ratios.

The code correctly handles all cases, including when the input numbers are less than the required ratio. For example, when the input is 2 lemons, 3 apples, and 2 pears, it correctly outputs 0 because there are not enough apples and pears to meet the ratio.

The output hints agree with the code and do not suggest any cases where the code does not work as expected. The code also correctly handles the provided examples and produces the expected output.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case, so the Correctness is **True**.
