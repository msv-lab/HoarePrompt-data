Correctness: **True**

The code provided accurately implements the problem description. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used to make a compote with a 1:2:4 ratio of lemons to apples to pears, based on the available amounts of each fruit. 

The key line of code is `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, which correctly determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used without exceeding the available amounts of apples or pears. 

The calculation of the total number of fruits, `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, is also correct, as it simply multiplies the number of lemons by the corresponding ratios for apples and pears.

All the provided examples are correctly handled by the code. For instance, in the first example, `max_lemons` is 1 (because `a` is 2, `b // 2` is 2, and `c // 4` is 1), resulting in `total_fruits` being 1 + 2 + 4 = 7. In the second example, `max_lemons` is 3, resulting in `total_fruits` being 3 + 6 + 12 = 21. In the third example, `max_lemons` is 0 (because `c // 4` is 0), resulting in `total_fruits` being 0.

The code handles the edge cases as expected. If the number of apples or pears is less than the required ratio, it correctly limits the number of lemons that can be used. If the number of lemons is less than the available apples and pears, it again correctly limits the number of lemons to the available amount. This ensures that the code works correctly for all potential cases.
