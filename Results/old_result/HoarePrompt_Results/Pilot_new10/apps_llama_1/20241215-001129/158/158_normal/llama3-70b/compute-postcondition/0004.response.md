The code prints the value of `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which is equivalent to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)` or `min_lemon * 7`. The value of `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. 

The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not changed by the code. The state of `min_lemon` is not changed either, it is just used in the calculation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is a new input integer between 1 and 1000, `c` is a new input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the printed value is `min_lemon * 7`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is a new input integer between 1 and 1000, `c` is a new input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the printed value is `min_lemon * 7`**
