The value of `c` is updated to be an input integer. The previous values of `a` and `b` are still valid, as well as the condition that `1 <= a <= 1000` and `1 <= b <= 1000`. The new value of `c` is an input integer, so `c` is now an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is a new input integer, `c` is the new input integer, `1 <= a <= 1000`, `1 <= b <= 1000`, and `c` is an input integer**
