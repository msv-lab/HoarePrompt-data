The function func accepts three positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears as input from the user. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used to make a compote with a 1:2:4 ratio of lemons to apples to pears, based on the available quantities of each fruit. It then calculates the total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote and prints this total. 

The function does not explicitly handle cases where the input values are not positive integers or are outside the range 1 to 1000, but it will still calculate and print the total number of fruits based on the given inputs. 

The function assumes that the inputs are provided in the order of lemons, apples, and pears, and that the ratio of lemons to apples to pears should be 1:2:4. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integers as input, calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used to make a compote with a 1:2:4 ratio of lemons to apples to pears, calculates the total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote, and prints this total, without explicitly handling invalid inputs or input ranges. **
