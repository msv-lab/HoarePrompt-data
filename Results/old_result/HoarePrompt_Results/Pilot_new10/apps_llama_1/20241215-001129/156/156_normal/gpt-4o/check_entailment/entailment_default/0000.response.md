Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1(n, m, k)` correctly calculates Lara's current position after `k` moves. 

The code first checks if `k` is less than `n - 1`, which means Lara is still moving down the first column. If so, it simply prints the current row and column `(k + 1, 1)`.

If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`, it means Lara has started moving in a snake-like pattern. The code calculates the number of full rows Lara has traversed `full_rows = k // (m - 1)` and the remaining steps `remaining_steps = k % (m - 1)`. 

Then, based on whether `full_rows` is even or odd, it calculates the current row and column. If `full_rows` is even, Lara is moving to the right, so the column is `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, Lara is moving to the left, so the column is `m - remaining_steps`. 

The code handles all possible cases and correctly calculates Lara's current position. The examples provided in the problem description also support this, and the output hints agree with the code's logic. Therefore, the code is correct and should work as expected for all potential cases.
