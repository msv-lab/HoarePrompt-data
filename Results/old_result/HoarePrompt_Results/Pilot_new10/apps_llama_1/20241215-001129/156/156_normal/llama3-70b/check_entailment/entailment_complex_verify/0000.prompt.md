You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You might have heard about the next game in Lara Croft series coming out this year. You also might have watched its trailer. Though you definitely missed the main idea about its plot, so let me lift the veil of secrecy.

Lara is going to explore yet another dangerous dungeon. Game designers decided to use good old 2D environment. The dungeon can be represented as a rectangle matrix of n rows and m columns. Cell (x, y) is the cell in the x-th row in the y-th column. Lara can move between the neighbouring by side cells in all four directions.

Moreover, she has even chosen the path for herself to avoid all the traps. She enters the dungeon in cell (1, 1), that is top left corner of the matrix. Then she goes down all the way to cell (n, 1) — the bottom left corner. Then she starts moving in the snake fashion — all the way to the right, one cell up, then to the left to the cell in 2-nd column, one cell up. She moves until she runs out of non-visited cells. n and m given are such that she always end up in cell (1, 2).

Lara has already moved to a neighbouring cell k times. Can you determine her current position?


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers n, m and k (2 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^9, n is always even, 0 ≤ k < n·m). Note that k doesn't fit into 32-bit integer type!


-----Output-----

Print the cell (the row and the column where the cell is situated) where Lara ends up after she moves k times.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 3 0

Output
1 1

Input
4 3 11

Output
1 2

Input
4 3 7

Output
3 2



-----Note-----

Here is her path on matrix 4 by 3: [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, k) = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    elif k < n * 2 - 2:
        print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
    else:
        print(1, 2)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct and follows the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program correctly handles the initial move from top to bottom by checking if `k < n - 1`. If true, it prints the current row number (`k + 1`) and column number (`1`).

2. After reaching the bottom, Lara moves in a snake-like fashion. The program correctly calculates the current row and column numbers using the formulas: 
   - `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` for the row number
   - `(k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1` for the column number

   These formulas take into account the snake-like movement pattern and the fact that Lara moves up and down by one row.

3. The program also correctly handles cases where `k` is equal to or greater than `n * 2 - 2` by printing `(1, 2)`, which is the final destination according to the problem description.

4. The use of `k %= n * 2 - 2` ensures that `k` is within the range of valid moves, which helps to simplify the calculations.

Since the program correctly handles all possible cases and follows the problem description, it is considered correct. The program handles the problem's constraints, such as the range of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and does not contain any apparent logical errors or edge cases that are not handled.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and m are positive integers where n is even, and k is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k < n*m.
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    k %= n * 2 - 2
    if (k < n - 1) :
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else :
        if (k < n * 2 - 2) :
            print(n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1, (k - n + 1) // (n - 1) + 1)
        else :
            print(1, 2)
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` and `m` are input integers, `k` is in the range 0 to 2n - 3, and `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1`. If `k` is less than `n * 2 - 2`, two values are printed: the first is `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` which ranges from 0 to `n - 1`, and the second is always 1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, the program prints 1 and 2.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` and `m` are input integers, `k` is in the range 0 to 2n - 3. If `k` is less than `n - 1`, the values of `k + 1` and 1 have been printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n - 1` and less than `n * 2 - 2`, the values of `n - (k - n + 1) % (n - 1) - 1` and 1 have been printed. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n * 2 - 2`, the values of 1 and 2 have been printed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` as input from the user, where `n` and `m` are positive integers and `k` is a non-negative integer, then prints specific values based on the reduced range of `k` modulo `n * 2 - 2`, without handling cases where `n` is odd or `k` is out of range, and without returning any messages.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
