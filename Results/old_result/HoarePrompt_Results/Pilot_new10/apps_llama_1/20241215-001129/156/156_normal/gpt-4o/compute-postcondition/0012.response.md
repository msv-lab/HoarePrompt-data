Postcondition: **`n` is an even positive integer and `2 <= n <= 10^9`, `m` is a positive integer and `2 <= m <= 10^9`, `k` is a non-negative integer less than `n * m`, `full_rows` equals `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` equals `k % (m - 1)`. If `full_rows` is even, then `row` equals `n - full_rows` and is even, `col` equals `2 + remaining_steps`. If `full_rows` is odd, then `row` equals `n - full_rows` and is odd, `col` equals `m - remaining_steps`.**
