The given code prints the value of `k + 1` and `1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not changed by the code. Since `k` is less than `n - 1`, `k + 1` will be less than `n`. 

Output State: **`n` and `m` are input integers, `k` is in the range 0 to 2n - 3, `k` is less than `n - 1`, and the value of `k + 1` and `1` has been printed**
