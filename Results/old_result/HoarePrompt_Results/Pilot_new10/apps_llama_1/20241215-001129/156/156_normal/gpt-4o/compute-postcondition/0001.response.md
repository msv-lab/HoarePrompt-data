The code prints the value of `k + 1` and `1`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not changed by the code. The state of the other variables is not affected. The previous value of `k` was less than `n - 1`, so the printed value of `k + 1` is less than `n`. 

The output of the print statement is `(k + 1, 1)`, where `k + 1` is less than `n` and `n` is even and `2 <= n, m <= 10^9`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is even and `2 <= n <= 10^9`, `m` is a positive integer such that `2 <= m <= 10^9`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n - 1`, and the value `(k + 1, 1)` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is even and `2 <= n <= 10^9`, `m` is a positive integer such that `2 <= m <= 10^9`, `k` is a non-negative integer such that `k < n - 1`, and the value `(k + 1, 1)` has been printed.**
