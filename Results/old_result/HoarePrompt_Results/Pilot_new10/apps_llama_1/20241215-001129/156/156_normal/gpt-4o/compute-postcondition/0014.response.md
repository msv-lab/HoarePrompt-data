Postcondition: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that `n` is even and `2 <= n, m <= 10^9`, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 <= k < n * m`. If `k < n - 1`, then the value `(k + 1, 1)` has been printed. Otherwise, `full_rows` equals `k // (m - 1)`, `remaining_steps` equals `k % (m - 1)`, if `full_rows` is even, then the values of `row` equals `n - full_rows` and `col` equals `2 + remaining_steps` have been printed, if `full_rows` is odd, then the values of `row` equals `n - full_rows` and `col` equals `m - remaining_steps` have been printed.**
