Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly implement the problem description for all cases. 

The issue lies in the line where the program calculates the position after going down all the way to cell (n, 1) and then moving in a snake fashion. 

The correct formula for calculating the row after going down all the way to cell (n, 1) and then moving in a snake fashion should be based on the number of steps taken (k) and the number of columns (m). 

However, the program reduces k modulo n * 2 - 2, which is incorrect. The reduction should be based on the total number of steps taken in the snake fashion, which is (n * 2 - 2) * (m - 1) + n - 1.

Also, when calculating the row and column after k steps, the program does not consider the correct snake pattern movement, which involves moving right, then up, then left, and so on. 

The correct implementation should be:

1. Calculate the number of full cycles of the snake pattern (i.e., (n * 2 - 2) * (m - 1)).
2. Calculate the remaining steps (k) after the full cycles.
3. Determine the row and column based on the remaining steps and the direction of the snake pattern.

Here is an example of a correct implementation:

```python
def func():
    n, m, k = map(int, input().split())
    total_steps = (n * 2 - 2) * (m - 1) + n - 1
    k %= total_steps

    if k < n - 1:
        print(k + 1, 1)
    else:
        k -= n - 1
        cycle = k // (n * 2 - 2)
        remaining_k = k % (n * 2 - 2)
        column = cycle + 2
        if remaining_k < n:
            row = n - remaining_k
            print(row, column)
        else:
            row = (n - 1) - (remaining_k - n + 1) % (n - 1)
            print(row, column - 1)
```

This implementation correctly calculates the position of Lara after k steps in the snake pattern. 

Therefore, the provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
