Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`. 

The issue lies in the calculation of `f_max(n)`. The function `func_2(n)` is not correctly calculating `f_max(n)`. It is calculating the GCD of the numbers from `1` to `n`, which is not the same as the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p`.

To calculate `f_max(n)`, we need to find the maximum number of distinct GCDs that can be obtained from the prefixes of a permutation of numbers from `1` to `n`. This is equivalent to the number of distinct prime factors of the numbers from `1` to `n`, since each prime factor will result in a new GCD when it is first encountered in the permutation.

Another issue is with the function `func_3(n, f_max_n)`. It is not correctly calculating the number of permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, such that `f(p)` is equal to `f_max(n)`. The dynamic programming approach used in this function is not correct, as it does not consider the actual GCDs of the prefixes of the permutations.

For example, for the input `n = 5`, the function `func_2(n)` will return `1`, which is the GCD of the numbers from `1` to `5`. However, the actual `f_max(5)` is `3`, which corresponds to the permutations where the first three numbers are `1`, `2`, and `3` or `1`, `3`, and `2`, in any order.

Therefore, the program does not correctly solve the problem for all potential cases.
