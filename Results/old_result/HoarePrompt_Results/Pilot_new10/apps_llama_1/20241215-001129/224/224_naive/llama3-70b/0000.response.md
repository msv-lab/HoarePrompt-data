Correctness: **False**.

The program provided does not correctly calculate the number of permutations where f(p) equals f_max(n). The function func_2(n) calculates f_max_n as the GCD of all numbers from 1 to n, which is not correct. The GCD of all numbers from 1 to n will always be 1, because 1 is a factor of every number. However, f_max(n) should be the maximum number of distinct GCDs that can be obtained from the prefixes of a permutation of numbers from 1 to n.

For example, in the case of n = 3, f_max(3) should be 2, because we can have permutations where the GCDs of the prefixes are [1, 1], [1, 2], or [1, 3], giving us 2 distinct GCDs.

The function func_3(n, f_max_n) also seems to be incorrect, as it simply calculates the factorial of n modulo 10^9 + 7, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to find the correct way to calculate f_max(n) and then find the number of permutations where f(p) equals f_max(n), which would likely involve a more complex algorithm. 

One potential approach could be to use dynamic programming to calculate the number of permutations with a given number of distinct GCDs, but this would require a more careful analysis of the problem and a correct understanding of how to calculate f_max(n). 

In the given case, since we can find a case when the program does not work correctly, the program is incorrect.
