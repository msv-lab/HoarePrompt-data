To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the return statement.

Given:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer.
- `MOD` is 1000000007.
- `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1`.

The list `dp` contains Fibonacci numbers modulo `MOD`. If `n` is greater than 0, `dp[j]` for `j` from 0 to `f_max_n` holds the `(j + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`. If `n` is 0, `dp[0]` is 1, and all other elements of `dp` are 0.

The return statement is `return dp[f_max_n]`.

This means the program returns the value stored in `dp` at the index `f_max_n`. Given the definition of `dp`, this value represents the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD` if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0, since `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `dp[f_max_n]` would be 0 because all elements of `dp` except `dp[0]` are 0 when `n` is 0.

Output State: **The program returns the (f_max_n + 1)th Fibonacci number modulo 1000000007 if n is greater than 0, otherwise it returns 0**
