The value of `dp[0]` is updated to 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` with `dp[0]` set to 1 and all other elements set to 0.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` with `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[i]` = 0 for `i` from 1 to `f_max_n`**
