To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The given code is:
```python
dp[j] %= MOD
```

Given the initial state:
- `n` is greater than the previous `n` and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer.
- `MOD` is `1000000007`.
- `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1`.
- For `j` from 0 to `f_max_n - 3`, `dp[j]` holds the `j + 1`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`.
- `dp[f_max_n - 2]` holds the `(f_max_n - 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`.
- `dp[f_max_n - 1]` holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`.
- `dp[f_max_n]` holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is `f_max_n - 2`.

The code `dp[j] %= MOD` means that the value at index `j` in the list `dp` is updated to be the remainder of the current value at `dp[j]` divided by `MOD`.

Given that `j` is `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[j]` initially holds the `(f_max_n - 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`. However, taking the modulo again with `MOD` does not change the value because it is already the result of a modulo operation with the same `MOD`, unless the previous operation resulted in a value greater than or equal to `MOD`, which is not indicated here. Thus, the operation essentially ensures that `dp[j]` remains the `(f_max_n - 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`.

Therefore, the output state remains largely the same as the initial state, with the focus being that `dp[j]` (where `j` is `f_max_n - 2`) is explicitly confirmed to be the `(f_max_n - 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, but given the context, this was already the case.

Output State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[j]` for `j` from 0 to `f_max_n - 3` holds the `j + 1`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `dp[f_max_n - 2]` holds the `(f_max_n - 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `dp[f_max_n]` holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`.**
