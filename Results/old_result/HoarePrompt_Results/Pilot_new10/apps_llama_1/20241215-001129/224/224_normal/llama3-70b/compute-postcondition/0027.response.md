To calculate the result, we need to consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.


Given the initial state: 
- `n` is greater than the previous `n` and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer.
- `MOD` is `1000000007`.
- `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[j]` for `j` from 0 to `f_max_n` holds the `j + 1`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is `f_max_n`.


The given Python code snippet is:
```
dp[j] += dp[j - 1]
```
This code snippet increments the value of `dp[j]` by the value of `dp[j - 1]`. Since `j` is `f_max_n`, this operation effectively updates the last element of the `dp` list (`dp[f_max_n]`) by adding the second-to-last element (`dp[f_max_n - 1]`) to it.


The update operation does not change the values of `n`, `f_max_n`, `MOD`, `i`, but it changes the value of `dp[j]` (which is `dp[f_max_n]`).


After the update, `dp[j]` (or `dp[f_max_n]`) will hold the value of `dp[f_max_n] + dp[f_max_n - 1]`, which is equivalent to the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, because in the Fibonacci sequence, each number is the sum of the two preceding ones.


The Output State is: 
- `n` is greater than the previous `n` and must be greater than or equal to 2.
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer.
- `MOD` is `1000000007`.
- `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[j]` for `j` from 0 to `f_max_n - 1` holds the `j + 1`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, and `dp[f_max_n]` holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`.
- `i` is 2.
- `j` is `f_max_n`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[j]` for `j` from 0 to `f_max_n - 1` holds the `j + 1`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, and `dp[f_max_n]` holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n`.**
