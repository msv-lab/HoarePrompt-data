The value of `dp[j]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[j]` divided by `MOD`. Given that `j` is `f_max_n - 1` and `dp[f_max_n - 1]` is 2, `dp[j]` becomes `2 % MOD`. Since `MOD` is `1000000007`, which is greater than 2, `dp[j]` remains 2.

Output State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n`, `f_max_n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1, `dp[j]` = 1 for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 2`, `dp[f_max_n - 1]` = 2, `dp[f_max_n]` = 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`**
