The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, calculates and returns their Greatest Common Divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm. It handles cases where `b` is initially zero by returning `a`, and it implicitly produces a positive result for the GCD, regardless of the signs of the input integers. The function does not explicitly handle non-integer inputs or provide absolute values as incorrectly suggested by the annotations.
