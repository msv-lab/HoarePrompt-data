The value of `dp[j]` is updated to be the remainder of `dp[j]` divided by `MOD`. Since `j` is `f_max_n`, the value of `dp[f_max_n]` is updated to be the remainder of the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD` divided by `MOD`, which means it remains the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD` because it is already less than `MOD`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n` and must be greater than or equal to 2, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[j]` for `j` from 0 to `f_max_n - 1` holds the `j + 1`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, and `dp[f_max_n]` holds the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `MOD`, `i` is 2, `j` is `f_max_n`**
