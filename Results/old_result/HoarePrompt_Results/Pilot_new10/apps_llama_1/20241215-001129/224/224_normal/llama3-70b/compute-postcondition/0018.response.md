To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is: `for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):`

This means the loop will iterate over the values from `f_max_n` down to 1 (inclusive) in reverse order.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is greater than the previous `n` (this information is not directly relevant to the loop's continuation condition),
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0,
- `MOD` is `1000000007` (this is a constant and does not affect the loop's execution directly),
- `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1, `dp[j]` = 1 for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[f_max_n]` = 2 (the state of `dp` is given but its modification depends on the loop body which is not provided),
- `i` is 1 (the value of `i` does not affect the loop's continuation condition directly since it's not part of the loop's control structure),
- `j` is `f_max_n`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be decremented by 1 because the loop iterates in reverse order. Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `j` should be `f_max_n - 1`.

Since `j` is now `f_max_n - 1`, we are looking at a situation where the loop can proceed if `f_max_n - 1` is greater than or equal to 1, which it will be since `f_max_n` is at least 2 (given `dp[f_max_n]` = 2 and `f_max_n` must be greater than 0).

State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n`, `f_max_n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1, `dp[j]` = 1 for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n - 1`, and `dp[f_max_n]` = 2, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 1`**
