After reviewing the problem description, the code, and the output hints, I have come to a conclusion about the correctness of the program.

The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the number of permutations where f(p) equals f_max(n). However, upon closer inspection of the code and the output hints, I believe that the original assessment is not entirely accurate.

The function `func_2(n)` calculates the maximum value of f(p) among all permutations of integers 1 to n, which is equivalent to the maximum number of distinct GCDs that can be obtained from the prefixes of a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. This function uses the Euclidean algorithm to calculate the GCD of two numbers, and it correctly handles cases where `b` is initially zero.

The function `func_3(n, f_max_n)` calculates and returns the (f_max_n + 1)th Fibonacci number modulo 10^9 + 7 if n is greater than 0, and returns 0 if n is 0. This function appears to be a correct implementation of the Fibonacci sequence modulo a large prime number.

However, the key issue here is that the function `func_2(n)` is not actually calculating the maximum number of distinct GCDs that can be obtained from the prefixes of a permutation of numbers from 1 to n. Instead, it is calculating the GCD of all numbers from 1 to n, which is always 1.

The function `func_3(n, f_max_n)` is also not being used correctly in this context. The Fibonacci sequence is not directly related to the problem of calculating the number of permutations where f(p) equals f_max(n).

Given the provided output hints and the problem description, I believe that the original assessment is accurate in the sense that the program does not correctly calculate the number of permutations where f(p) equals f_max(n).

The main reason for this is that the function `func_2(n)` does not correctly calculate f_max(n), and the function `func_3(n, f_max_n)` is not being used in a way that is relevant to the problem.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is incorrect based on the problem description and the provided code.

Final: **False**
