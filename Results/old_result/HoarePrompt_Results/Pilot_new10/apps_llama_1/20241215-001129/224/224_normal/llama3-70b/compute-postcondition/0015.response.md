According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `f_max_n`. If `f_max_n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than the previous `n`, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[j]` = 1 for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, and `i` is 1. 

For the loop to execute, `f_max_n` must be greater than 0, and `j` is now `f_max_n`. The state of `n`, `MOD`, `dp`, and `i` does not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than the previous `n`, `f_max_n` is a positive integer and must be greater than 0, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[j]` = 1 for `j` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n`**
