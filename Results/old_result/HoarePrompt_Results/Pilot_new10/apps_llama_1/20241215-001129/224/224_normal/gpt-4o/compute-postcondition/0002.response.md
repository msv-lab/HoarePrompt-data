To calculate the output state, let's examine the given code and initial state. 

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6
- `mod` is 10^9 + 7
- `result` is 1
- `i` is 2

The given code is: 
```
result = result * i % mod
```

Now, calculating the new value of `result` based on the initial state:
- `result` initially is 1
- `i` is 2
- `mod` is 10^9 + 7

So, `result` becomes `1 * 2 % (10^9 + 7)`.

Calculating `1 * 2 % (10^9 + 7)`:
- `1 * 2` equals 2
- `2 % (10^9 + 7)` equals 2 because 2 is less than `(10^9 + 7)`

Therefore, `result` becomes 2 after the execution of the given code.

The states of `n`, `mod`, and `i` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 2, `i` is 2**
