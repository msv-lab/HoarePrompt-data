According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is a non-negative integer, which means it can be 0, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure that `n` is greater than 0 for the loop to execute. Additionally, `i` is introduced in the loop and will take values from 1 to `n` (inclusive), so `i` is 1 at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `f_max_n` is a positive integer, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` with `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[i]` = 0 for `i` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `i` is 1**
