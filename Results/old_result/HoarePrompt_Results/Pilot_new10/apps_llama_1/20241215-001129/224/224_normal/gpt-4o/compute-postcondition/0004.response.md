The code updates the value of `result` by multiplying it with `i` and taking the modulus `mod`. 

Given that `result` is 2, `i` is 3, and `mod` is 10^9 + 7, we calculate the new value of `result`:

`result` = (`result` * `i`) % `mod`
= (2 * 3) % (10^9 + 7)
= 6 % (10^9 + 7)
= 6

Since 6 is less than 10^9 + 7, the modulus operation does not change the value.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 3 <= n <= 10^6, `mod` is 10^9 + 7, `result` is 6, `i` is 3**
