To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the given loop statement and the current state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop statement is `for j in range(f_max_n, 0, -1):`, which means `j` will decrease by 1 in each iteration until it reaches 1.

At the end of the previous iteration, the state is:
- `n` is greater than 0
- `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1
- `MOD` is `1000000007`
- `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[i]` = 0 for `i` from 1 to `f_max_n`
- `dp[j]` = 0
- `i` is 1
- `j` is `f_max_n - 1`

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be greater than 0 because the loop condition is `j` in `range(f_max_n, 0, -1)`. Since `j` is currently `f_max_n - 1`, to execute the loop one more time after the current state, `j` should be decremented by 1. Thus, `j` should become `f_max_n - 2`. Also, since `j` is used to index `dp`, `dp[j]` should refer to the element at index `f_max_n - 2` in the list `dp`.

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `f_max_n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `MOD` is `1000000007`, `dp` is a list of size `f_max_n + 1` where `dp[0]` = 1 and `dp[i]` = 0 for `i` from 1 to `f_max_n`, `dp[j]` = 0, `i` is 1, `j` is `f_max_n - 2`**
