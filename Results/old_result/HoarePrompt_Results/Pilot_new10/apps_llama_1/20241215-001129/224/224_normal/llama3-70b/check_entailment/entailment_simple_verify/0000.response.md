The original assessment states that the program provided does not correctly calculate the number of permutations where f(p) equals f_max(n). Upon reviewing the code and the annotated version, it appears that the original assessment is correct.

The issue lies in the function `func_2(n)`, which calculates `f_max_n` as the maximum of the GCD of the current `res` and `i` for `i` in range from 1 to `n`. However, this approach does not accurately calculate `f_max_n`.

`f_max_n` is defined as the maximum value of `f(p)` among all permutations `p` of integers `1`, `2`,..., `n`, where `f(p)` is the number of distinct elements among the GCDs of the prefixes of `p`. The current implementation of `func_2(n)` does not consider the permutations of the numbers or the GCDs of the prefixes.

Furthermore, the function `func_3(n, f_max_n)` calculates the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number modulo `1000000007`, which is not directly related to the problem description. The problem description asks for the number of permutations `p` such that `f(p)` equals `f_max(n)`, which is not the same as calculating the `(f_max_n + 1)`th Fibonacci number.

The annotated version of the code does not provide any additional insight that would contradict the original assessment. In fact, it reinforces the idea that `func_2(n)` and `func_3(n, f_max_n)` are not correctly implemented.

Therefore, based on the problem description and the provided code, it appears that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
