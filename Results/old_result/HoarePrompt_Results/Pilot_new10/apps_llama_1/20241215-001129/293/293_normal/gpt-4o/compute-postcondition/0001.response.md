The code snippet provided uses the `map` function to convert the input from the user into two integer values, `h` and `n`, based on the spaces in the input string. 

Given that `h` is initially an integer between 1 and 50 inclusive and `n` is an integer between 1 and 2^`h` inclusive, and considering the impact of the code on these variables, we see that their values are updated based on the user's input.

`h` is assigned the first integer value from the input, and `n` is assigned the second integer value from the input.

However, without the actual input from the user, we cannot determine the exact values of `h` and `n`. But we can describe their potential range based on the constraints typically imposed by such integer inputs and the original constraints on `h` and `n`.

The original constraints that `h` is between 1 and 50 inclusive and `n` is between 1 and 2^`h` inclusive are superseded by the values input by the user. Thus, after the code executes, `h` will be an integer determined by the user's input, and `n` will also be determined by the user's input.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is an input integer**
