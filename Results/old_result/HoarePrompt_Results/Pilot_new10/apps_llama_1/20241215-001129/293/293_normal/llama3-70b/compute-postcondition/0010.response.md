The value of `ans` is increased by `n // 2 - 1`. The original `n` must have been greater than 2, and `n` is `n // 2`. This implies that the current `n` is greater than 1 because the original `n` was greater than 2. 

Since `n` is `n // 2`, let's express the original `n` as `2 * n`. So, `2 * n` must have been greater than 2. This condition is always true since `n` is greater than 1.

The new value of `ans` is `ans + n // 2 - 1`. The value of `h` is still an input integer.

Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is greater than 1, `ans` is `ans + n // 2 - 1`**
