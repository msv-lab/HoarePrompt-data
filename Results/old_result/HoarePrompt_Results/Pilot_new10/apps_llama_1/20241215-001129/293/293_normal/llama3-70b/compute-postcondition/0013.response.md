The value of `n` is updated to `n // 2`. Since the original `n` must have been greater than 2 and `n` is now updated to `n // 2`, the new `n` is the original `n` divided by 4. 
Given `n` is `n // 2` where the original `n` must have been greater than 2, it means that the previous value of `n` is in the range of [2, inf). After executing the line `n //= 2`, `n` will be in the range of [1, inf). 
Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `h` is an input integer, `n` is `n // 4` where the original `n` must have been greater than 2. If the new `n` is even, `ans` is updated to `ans + n // 2 - 1`. If the new `n` is odd, `ans` is updated to `ans + n // 2`.
Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is `n // 4` where the original `n` must have been greater than 2. If the new `n` is even, `ans` is updated to `ans + n // 2 - 1`. If the new `n` is odd, `ans` is updated to `ans + n // 2`.**
