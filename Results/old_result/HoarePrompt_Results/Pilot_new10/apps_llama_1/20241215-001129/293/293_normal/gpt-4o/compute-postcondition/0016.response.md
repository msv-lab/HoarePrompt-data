To solve this, we first note that the initial state includes several variables: `h` as an input integer greater than 0, `n` as an input integer, `total_leaves` equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a binary string with at least one more character, and `current_level` is 1. However, the given code snippet only affects `current_node`.

Given the code:
```python
current_node = 2 * current_node + 1
```
We observe that the value of `current_node` is updated based on its previous value. However, the initial state does not specify the initial value of `current_node`. 

Given this information, the impact of the code is that it updates the value of `current_node` to be `2 * current_node + 1`, where `current_node`'s initial value is not specified in the initial state.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. Thus, `h` remains an input integer greater than 0, `n` remains an input integer, `total_leaves` remains equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` remains 3, `path` remains a binary string with at least one more character, and `current_level` remains 1.

Since `current_node`'s initial value is not provided, we can only express its new value in terms of its previous value. 

Output State: **`h` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` is 3, `path` is a binary string with at least one more character, `current_level` is 1, and `current_node` is `2 * (previous value of current_node) + 1`**
