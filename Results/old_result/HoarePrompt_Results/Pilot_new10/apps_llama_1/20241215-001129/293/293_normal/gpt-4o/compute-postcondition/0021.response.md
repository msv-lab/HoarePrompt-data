To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the given initial state and how the provided Python code snippet affects it.

The initial state is as follows:
- `h` is an input integer greater than 0.
- `n` is an input integer.
- `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`.
- `visited_count` is 5.
- `path` is a binary string with at least one more character after the current character.
- `current_level` is 2.

However, there seems to be a variable `current_node` that is not defined in the initial state but is being used in the code snippet. Given the context, it appears that `current_node` should be defined before the code execution, but since its initial value is not provided, we will have to express its new value in terms of its previous value.

The code snippet is:
```python
current_node = 2 * current_node + 1
```

This code multiplies the current value of `current_node` by 2 and then adds 1 to it.

Since the initial value of `current_node` is not specified, we can only describe its change. The new value of `current_node` will be `2 * current_node + 1`, where `current_node` refers to its value before this operation.

All other variables (`h`, `n`, `total_leaves`, `visited_count`, `path`, `current_level`) remain unchanged as the code snippet does not affect them.

Therefore, the output state, considering the initial state and the change in `current_node`, is:
Output State: **`h` is an input integer greater than 0, `n` is an input integer, `total_leaves` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `h`, `visited_count` is 5, `path` is a binary string with at least one more character after the current character, `current_level` is 2, and `current_node` is `2 * previous_value_of_current_node + 1`.**
