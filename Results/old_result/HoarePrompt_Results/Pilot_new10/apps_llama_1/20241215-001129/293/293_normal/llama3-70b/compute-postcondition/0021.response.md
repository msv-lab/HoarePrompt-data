The function `func` does not explicitly define parameters `h` and `n`. However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it is expected that the function should accept two parameters, `h` and `n`, where `h` is a positive integer between 1 and 50, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 2^h.

Given the constraints, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two parameters, `h` and `n`, with `h` being the height of a binary tree and `n` being the index of an exit node, and return a value based on these inputs. However, the specific return value is not defined in the provided output.


Functionality: **The function accepts parameters h and n, where h is the height of a binary tree and n is the index of an exit node, and returns a value based on these inputs.**
