To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

1. The loop condition is `while n > 1:`, which means for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 1 after the previous iteration.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is `n // 4`, and the original `n` must have been greater than 2.
3. For `n` to be greater than 1 after the division by 4, the new `n` (which is `n // 4`) must be at least 2, because if it were 1, the loop would terminate.

Given that `n` is updated to `n // 4`, for `n // 4` to be greater than 1 (to satisfy the loop condition for another iteration), the original `n` before the division must be greater than 4, because `n // 4 > 1` implies `n > 4`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is that `n` must be greater than 4 before the division by 4, to ensure `n // 4` is greater than 1.

State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` must have been greater than 4 before the division by 4**
