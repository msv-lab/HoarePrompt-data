The value of `ans` is increased by `n // 2`. The original value of `n` must have been greater than 2 and is currently `n // 2`. So, the value of `n` in the equation is `n // 2`. 
We know `n` is `n // 2` and `n` must have been greater than 2. Let us call the original value of `n` as `n_original`. 
Then `n` = `n_original // 2` and `n_original` > 2. 
Since `n` = `n_original // 2`, then `n_original` = 2 * `n`. 
We also know `n_original` > 2. 
Therefore, `n` > 1. 
The equation `ans += n // 2` is equivalent to `ans = ans + n // 2` which is equivalent to `ans = ans + (n Original // 2) // 2` which is equivalent to `ans = ans + (2 * n) // 4` which is equivalent to `ans = ans + n // 2`. 
The value of `h` is still an input integer and `n` is still `n // 2` where the original `n` is greater than 2. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `h` is an input integer, `n` is `n // 2` where the original `n` is greater than 2 and `ans` is increased by `n // 2` which is equivalent to the original `ans` plus `n // 2`.
Output State: **`h` is an input integer, `n` is `n // 2` where the original `n` must have been greater than 2, `ans` is the original `ans` plus `n // 2`**
