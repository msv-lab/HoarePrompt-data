Correctness: **False**

The given Python program does not accurately model the problem description. The program simply calculates the path to the exit node, assuming that Amr always moves directly to the exit without considering the rules about skipping commands and backtracking.

However, the program description states that Amr follows a specific algorithm that involves skipping commands, backtracking when two consecutive commands are skipped, and returning to the parent node when a non-exit leaf node is reached. The program does not account for these rules, which can affect the total number of nodes visited.

For example, consider a tree with height 2 and exit node 3. The program will calculate the path to the exit node, which is "01" (left, then right). However, according to the problem description, Amr will first move left (to node 1), then skip the next command (since node 1 is not the exit), then move back to the root node (since two consecutive commands were skipped), then move right (to node 3), which is the exit node. In this case, the program will incorrectly calculate the number of visited nodes.

To correctly solve the problem, a more complex algorithm or data structure, such as a tree or a stack, would be needed to track the current node, the command history, and the visited nodes. The given program is too simplistic and does not accurately model the problem description. 

In conclusion, the program is incorrect because it does not consider the rules about skipping commands, backtracking, and returning to the parent node, which are essential to calculating the total number of nodes visited.
