According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `a` and `b`. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 3 times the input integer, `b` is 2 times the input integer, and `years` is 1. Since `a` is 3 times the input integer and `b` is 2 times the input integer, `a` will always be greater than `b` if the input integer is positive. For `a` to be less than or equal to `b`, the input integer must be less than or equal to 0, or the relationship between `a` and `b` needs to be adjusted.

State: **`a` is 3 times the input integer, `b` is 2 times the input integer, `years` is 1, and `a` must be less than or equal to `b`**
