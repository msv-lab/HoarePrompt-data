The code `b *= 2` multiplies the value of `b` by 2. The initial state is: `a` is 3 times its initial integer value, `b` is an integer, `years` is 0.

The value of `b` is now twice its original value. The states of the other variables, `a` and `years`, are not affected.

Let's denote the initial integer value of `a` as `x`. Then, `a` is equal to `3x`. 

The output state is: `a` is 3 times its initial integer value, `b` is 2 times its initial integer value, `years` is 0.

Output State: **`a` is 3 times its initial integer value, `b` is 2 times its initial integer value, `years` is 0**
