The code `years += 1` increments the value of `years` by 1. Initially, `years` is 2, so after the increment, `years` becomes 3. The other variables `a`, `b`, `9A`, `4B`, `27y`, and `8x` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`a` is 27 times its initial integer value, `b` is 8 times its initial integer value, `9A <= 4B`, `27y <= 8x`, and `years` is 3**
