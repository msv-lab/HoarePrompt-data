The function func accepts two integers as input, representing the initial weights of Limak and Bob. According to the code, it enters a loop where Limak's weight is tripled and Bob's weight is doubled in each iteration, until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's weight. The function then prints the number of iterations (years) it took for Limak's weight to exceed Bob's weight. 

Note that the annotations specify that 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, but the code itself does not enforce these constraints. Therefore, the function can handle any integer inputs for a and b, not just those within the specified range. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the inputs are not integers or cannot be parsed as such.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer inputs representing initial weights, iteratively triples the first weight and doubles the second until the first exceeds the second, and prints the number of iterations required, handling any integer inputs but not validating or handling non-integer inputs. **
