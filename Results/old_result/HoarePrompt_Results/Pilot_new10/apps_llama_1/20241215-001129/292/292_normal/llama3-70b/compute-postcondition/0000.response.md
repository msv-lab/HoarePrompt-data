The values of `a` and `b` are updated based on the input provided. The `map(int, input().split())` function takes an input string, splits it into two parts, and converts each part to an integer. The input values are then assigned to `a` and `b`, respectively.

Since the initial state constraints (1 <= a <= b <= 10) are not guaranteed to be satisfied after the input operation, we only know that `a` and `b` will be integers.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are integers**
