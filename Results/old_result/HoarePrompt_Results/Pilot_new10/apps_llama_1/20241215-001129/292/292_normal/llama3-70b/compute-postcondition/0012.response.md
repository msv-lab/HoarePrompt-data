To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `a` is 27 times its initial integer value (`A`).
- `b` is 4 times its initial integer value (`B`).
- The inequality `9A <= 4B` holds.
- The inequality `27y <= 8x` holds.
- `years` is 2.

Given `a = 27A` and `b = 4B`, we can rewrite the inequality `9A <= 4B` as `9A <= b` since `b = 4B`. Similarly, we can express `a` in terms of `A` but we don't have direct relationships to simplify `27y <= 8x` without knowing `x` and `y`'s initial values or their relationship to `a`, `b`, `A`, or `B`.

The code `b *= 2` doubles the value of `b`. Therefore, `b` becomes `2 * 4B = 8B`.

Given that `b` is now `8B`, and knowing that `9A <= 4B`, we can see that this relationship still holds because `b` has increased, which does not violate the inequality `9A <= 4B`. However, the new value of `b` is `8B`, which means `b` is now twice its original value.

The states of `a`, `years`, and the inequalities `27y <= 8x` are not directly affected by the code `b *= 2`, assuming `x` and `y` are not functions of `b` or are otherwise dependent on `b`'s value in a manner not specified.

Therefore, after executing `b *= 2`, the output state is:
- `a` is 27 times its initial integer value (`A`).
- `b` is 8 times its initial integer value (`B`), or simply `b = 8B`.
- The inequality `9A <= 4B` still holds.
- The inequality `27y <= 8x` holds, though its direct relevance to `a` and `b` is not specified.
- `years` is 2.

Output State: **`a` is 27 times its initial integer value, `b` is 8 times its initial integer value, `9A <= 4B`, `27y <= 8x`, and `years` is 2**
