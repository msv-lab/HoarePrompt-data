Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the problem description. It iteratively triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight until Limak's weight exceeds Bob's, at which point it prints the number of years required for this to happen.

The code handles all potential cases, including when Limak and Bob start with the same weight, as well as when Limak starts with a weight less than Bob's. It also correctly handles cases where the number of years required for Limak to become heavier than Bob is 1 or more.

The output hints agree with the code, and they provide a clear understanding of how the function works. The code does not contain any syntax errors or logical errors that would cause it to produce incorrect results for any potential case.

Additionally, the provided examples in the problem description match the expected output of the code, which further confirms its correctness. For instance, in the example where Limak starts with a weight of 4 and Bob starts with a weight of 7, the code correctly prints 2 as the number of years required for Limak to become heavier than Bob. Similarly, in the example where Limak starts with a weight of 4 and Bob starts with a weight of 9, the code correctly prints 3. 

The code is also able to handle cases where Limak and Bob start with the same weight, such as in the example where both Limak and Bob start with a weight of 1, in which case the code correctly prints 1.

Therefore, based on the problem description, output hints, and examples, it can be concluded that the code is correct and will produce the expected output for all potential cases.
