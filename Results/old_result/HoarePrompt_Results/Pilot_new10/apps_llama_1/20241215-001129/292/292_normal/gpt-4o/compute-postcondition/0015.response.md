The print statement does not change the values of any variables. It simply outputs the value of `years` to the console. 

Output State: **`a` is greater than `b`, `a` is `3^years * initial_a`, `b` is `2^years * initial_b`, `years` is the number of iterations needed for `a` to exceed `b`, starting from their initial values, and the value of `years` has been printed**
