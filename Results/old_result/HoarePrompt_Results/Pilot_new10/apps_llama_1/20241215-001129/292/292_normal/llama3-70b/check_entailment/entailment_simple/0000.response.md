Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading two integers `a` and `b` from the input, which represent the initial weights of Limak and Bob, respectively.

2. **Loop Condition**: The program then enters a while loop that continues as long as `a` (Limak's weight) is less than or equal to `b` (Bob's weight). This is in line with the problem's requirement that Limak wants to become strictly larger than Bob.

3. **Weight Update**: Within the loop, `a` is multiplied by 3 and `b` is multiplied by 2, simulating the tripling and doubling of their weights after each year, respectively.

4. **Year Counter**: The variable `years` is incremented by 1 at the end of each iteration, keeping track of the number of years it takes for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.

5. **Output**: Once the loop exits (i.e., when `a` becomes greater than `b`), the program prints the value of `years`, which represents the number of full years it took for Limak to become strictly larger than Bob.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including when `a` is initially equal to `b`, because the loop condition is `a <= b`, ensuring that the loop runs at least once to differentiate Limak's weight from Bob's.

The logic is sound, and the implementation matches the problem description. Therefore, the program will always produce the correct output according to the problem's requirements.
