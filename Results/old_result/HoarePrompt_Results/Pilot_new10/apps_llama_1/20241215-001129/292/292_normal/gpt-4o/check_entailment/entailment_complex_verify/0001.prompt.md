You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Bear Limak wants to become the largest of bears, or at least to become larger than his brother Bob.

Right now, Limak and Bob weigh a and b respectively. It's guaranteed that Limak's weight is smaller than or equal to his brother's weight.

Limak eats a lot and his weight is tripled after every year, while Bob's weight is doubled after every year.

After how many full years will Limak become strictly larger (strictly heavier) than Bob?


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains two integers a and b (1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10) — the weight of Limak and the weight of Bob respectively.


-----Output-----

Print one integer, denoting the integer number of years after which Limak will become strictly larger than Bob.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 7

Output
2

Input
4 9

Output
3

Input
1 1

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first sample, Limak weighs 4 and Bob weighs 7 initially. After one year their weights are 4·3 = 12 and 7·2 = 14 respectively (one weight is tripled while the other one is doubled). Limak isn't larger than Bob yet. After the second year weights are 36 and 28, so the first weight is greater than the second one. Limak became larger than Bob after two years so you should print 2.

In the second sample, Limak's and Bob's weights in next years are: 12 and 18, then 36 and 36, and finally 108 and 72 (after three years). The answer is 3. Remember that Limak wants to be larger than Bob and he won't be satisfied with equal weights.

In the third sample, Limak becomes larger than Bob after the first year. Their weights will be 3 and 2 then.
Program:
```
def func():
    (a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        b *= 2
        years += 1
    print(years)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes the initial weights of Limak and Bob as input, then enters a loop where it triples Limak's weight and doubles Bob's weight, incrementing the number of years each time. The loop continues until Limak's weight is strictly greater than Bob's weight, at which point it prints the number of years.

The program handles all possible cases correctly. It correctly handles the case where Limak and Bob have the same initial weight, as well as cases where Limak's initial weight is less than Bob's. The program also correctly handles cases where Limak becomes larger than Bob after one year, as well as cases where it takes multiple years for Limak to become larger.

The examples provided also demonstrate the correctness of the program. For example, when the input is 4 7, the program correctly outputs 2, which is the number of years it takes for Limak to become larger than Bob. Similarly, when the input is 4 9, the program correctly outputs 3, and when the input is 1 1, the program correctly outputs 1.

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers, 1 ≤ a ≤ b ≤ 10, and represent the initial weights of Limak and Bob respectively.
def func():
    a, b = map(int, input().split())
    years = 0
    while a <= b:
        a *= 3
        
        b *= 2
        
        years += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is greater than `b`, `a` is `3^years * initial_a`, `b` is `2^years * initial_b`, `years` is the number of iterations needed for `a` to exceed `b`, starting from their initial values
    print(years)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer inputs representing initial weights, iteratively triples the first weight and doubles the second until the first exceeds the second, and prints the number of iterations required, handling any integer inputs but not validating or handling non-integer inputs.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
