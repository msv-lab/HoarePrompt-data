Correctness: **True**

The code is correct because it implements a brute-force approach to find the minimum number of segments needed to draw `n` squares. The function `func_1(n)` iterates over all possible values of `a` from 1 to the square root of `n` and calculates the number of segments needed for each `a`. The number of segments needed is calculated as `2 * (a + b)`, where `b = (n + a - 1) // a`.

This calculation is based on the fact that to draw `n` squares, Sofia needs to draw `a` rows and `b` columns of squares. For each row, she needs to draw a horizontal segment, and for each column, she needs to draw a vertical segment. However, she can use the existing segments as guidelines to draw the remaining segments, so she only needs to draw `2 * a` horizontal segments and `2 * b` vertical segments with a ruler.

The code correctly handles all cases where `n` is between 1 and 10^9, as it iterates over all possible values of `a` and calculates the minimum number of segments needed. The provided examples also demonstrate the correctness of the code, as it produces the expected output for the given inputs.

The output hints agree with the code, as they describe the function's behavior and provide examples of the cases that the code handles correctly. Overall, the code is a correct implementation of the problem description, and it produces the expected output for all potential cases.
