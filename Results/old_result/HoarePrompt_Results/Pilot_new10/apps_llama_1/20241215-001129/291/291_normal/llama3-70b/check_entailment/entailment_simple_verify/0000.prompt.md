You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Little Sofia is in fourth grade. Today in the geometry lesson she learned about segments and squares. On the way home, she decided to draw $n$ squares in the snow with a side length of $1$. For simplicity, we assume that Sofia lives on a plane and can draw only segments of length $1$, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points.

In order to draw a segment, Sofia proceeds as follows. If she wants to draw a vertical segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x, y)$ and $(x, y+1)$. Then Sofia looks if there is already a drawn segment with the coordinates of the ends $(x', y)$ and $(x', y+1)$ for some $x'$. If such a segment exists, then Sofia quickly draws a new segment, using the old one as a guideline. If there is no such segment, then Sofia has to take a ruler and measure a new segment for a long time. Same thing happens when Sofia wants to draw a horizontal segment, but only now she checks for the existence of a segment with the same coordinates $x$, $x+1$ and the differing coordinate $y$.

For example, if Sofia needs to draw one square, she will have to draw two segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining two segments, using the first two as a guide:  [Image] 

If Sofia needs to draw two squares, she will have to draw three segments using a ruler:  [Image] 

After that, she can draw the remaining four segments, using the first three as a guide:  [Image] 

Sofia is in a hurry, so she wants to minimize the number of segments that she will have to draw with a ruler without a guide. Help her find this minimum number.

Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program calculates the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw n squares in the manner described. The program uses the bit length of the number n to calculate this minimum number.

The key insight here is that the number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler is equal to the number of rows and columns of the grid of squares. The number of rows and columns can be determined by the bit length of n, because the bit length of n represents the minimum number of binary digits needed to represent n. 

For example, if n = 4, then the bit length of n is 3 (because 4 = 100 in binary), and the minimum grid size needed to arrange 4 squares is a 2x2 grid, which has 2 rows and 2 columns. Therefore, the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler is 2 * (number of rows) + 2 * (number of columns - 1), which in this case is 2 * 2 + 2 * 1 = 6. However, in this problem, the correct calculation is 2 * (number of rows - 1) + 2 * (number of columns - 1) + 2, which is 2 * 1 + 2 * 1 + 2 = 6. But for the rows or columns with value 1 the correct calculation should be 2. This is handled by the program when n is a power of 2.

The given program correctly calculates this minimum number as 2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2. The reason for subtracting 1 from n.bit_length() is to account for the fact that the number of rows and columns is equal to the bit length of n minus 1. 

However, a more straightforward way to prove the correctness of the program would be to analyze the grid arrangement of the squares for different values of n. If n is a perfect square, the grid will be a square grid. If n is not a perfect square, the grid will be a rectangle. 

If we analyze the grid arrangement for different values of n, we can see that the minimum number of segments that need to be drawn with a ruler is always equal to 2 * (number of rows - 1) + 2 * (number of columns - 1) + 2, which is equivalent to the formula used in the program.

Therefore, the given program correctly calculates the minimum number of segments that Sofia will have to draw with a ruler without a guide in order to draw n squares in the manner described.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: the function takes no arguments and the input is a single integer n (1 <= n <= 10^9) that represents the number of squares Sofia wants to draw.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    print(2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
