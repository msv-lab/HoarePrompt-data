    return min_segments_needed
    #The program returns the minimum of all possible 2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a) for 'a' ranging from 1 to the square root of 'n', where 'n' is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the minimum value of `2 * (a + (n + a - 1) // a)` for all possible values of `a` ranging from 1 to the square root of `n`, handling all cases where `n` is between 1 and 10^9.
