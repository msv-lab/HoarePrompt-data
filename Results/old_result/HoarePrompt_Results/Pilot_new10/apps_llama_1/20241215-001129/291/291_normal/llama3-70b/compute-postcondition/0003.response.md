The function `func` accepts no arguments, but it takes an integer input `n` from the user, where `n` is expected to be between 1 and 10^9. The function then calculates and prints the result of the expression `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2`. 

The `bit_length()` method returns the number of bits necessary to represent `n` in binary. The expression `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` seems to be related to the number of bits in `n`, but its exact purpose is not explicitly stated in the annotations. 

The function does not handle cases where the input `n` is not an integer or is outside the expected range. It also does not handle any potential exceptions that might occur during the input or calculation process.

Functionality: ** The function accepts no arguments, takes an integer input `n` from the user, calculates and prints the result of the expression `2 * (n.bit_length() - 1) + 2` without handling any potential exceptions or input validation, assuming the input is a valid integer. **
