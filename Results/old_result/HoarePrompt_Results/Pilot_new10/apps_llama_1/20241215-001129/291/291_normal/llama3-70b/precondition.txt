## Step 1: Understand the problem description
The problem describes Little Sofia drawing n squares in the snow with a side length of 1. She can draw segments of length 1, parallel to the coordinate axes, with vertices at integer points. To minimize the time spent drawing, Sofia wants to minimize the number of segments that she has to draw with a ruler without a guide.

## Step 2: Identify the key elements of the problem
The key elements are the number of squares (n) that Sofia wants to draw and the fact that she can use previously drawn segments as a guide to draw new segments.

## Step 3: Determine the precondition
Based on the problem description, the precondition is that n is a positive integer, as it represents the number of squares that Sofia wants to draw.

The final answer is: $\boxed{**n is a positive integer.**}$
