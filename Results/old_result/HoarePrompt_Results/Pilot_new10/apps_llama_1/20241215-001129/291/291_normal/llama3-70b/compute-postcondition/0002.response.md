The function `func` takes no arguments, but it is stated that the input is a single integer `n` that represents the number of squares Sofia wants to draw. Since the function takes no arguments, we can assume that the input `n` is defined within the function or is a global variable. `n` is an integer where 1 <= `n` <= 10^9. 

However, the output of the function is not provided. Therefore, based on the given information, I can only describe the input parameter.


Functionality: **The function accepts no arguments but is associated with an integer input n, where n is between 1 and 10^9, and the return value is not specified.**
