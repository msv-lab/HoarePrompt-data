Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to compare two numbers represented in different bases. The `func_1` function accurately converts the given digits in a specific base to a decimal number. This conversion is done by iterating over each digit and multiplying the current result by the base, then adding the current digit.

The main part of the program reads the input correctly, calculates the decimal representations of X and Y using `func_1`, and compares them. The comparison logic is straightforward and correctly handles all possible outcomes, printing '<' if X is less than Y, '>' if X is greater than Y, and '=' if X equals Y.

All examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the program. Additionally, the program's logic is robust and should work for any valid input within the specified constraints (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10 and 2 ≤ bx, by ≤ 40). It handles the conversion and comparison correctly, regardless of the bases and digits of the input numbers.

The program does not contain any apparent flaws or missed edge cases that would cause it to deviate from the problem's requirements. Therefore, it is concluded that the program is correct and will work as expected for all specified inputs.
