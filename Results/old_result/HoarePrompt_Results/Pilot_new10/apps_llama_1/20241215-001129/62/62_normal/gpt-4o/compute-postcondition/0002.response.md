The value of `decimal_value` is updated to be `decimal_value * base + digit`. Initially, `decimal_value` is 0, so `decimal_value * base` is 0. Thus, `decimal_value` becomes `digit`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, each less than `base`, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), `decimal_value` is equal to the first digit in `digits`, and `digit` will be the first digit in `digits`.

Output State: **`digits` is a non-empty list of non-negative integers, each less than `base`, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), `decimal_value` is equal to the first digit in `digits`, and `digit` is the first digit in `digits`**
