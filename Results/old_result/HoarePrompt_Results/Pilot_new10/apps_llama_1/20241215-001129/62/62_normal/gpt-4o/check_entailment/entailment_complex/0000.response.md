Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input data for two numbers `X` and `Y` represented in different bases `b_x` and `b_y`, converts them to their decimal equivalents using the function `func_1`, and then compares the decimal values to determine the relationship between `X` and `Y`.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal equivalent of a number represented in a given base. It initializes a variable `decimal_value` to 0 and then iterates over the digits of the number from most significant to least significant, multiplying the current `decimal_value` by the base and adding the current digit. This process is equivalent to the standard method for converting a number from any base to decimal.

The main part of the program uses the `func_1` function to convert both `X` and `Y` to decimal, and then compares the decimal values to determine the relationship between `X` and `Y`. The comparison is straightforward: if the decimal value of `X` is less than the decimal value of `Y`, it prints `<`; if the decimal value of `X` is greater than the decimal value of `Y`, it prints `>`; otherwise, it prints `=`.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, assuming that the input data is valid according to the problem description (i.e., the numbers are positive, the bases are between 2 and 40, and the digits are non-negative and less than their respective bases). The program does not perform any error checking or handling for invalid input, but this is not required by the problem description.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and will produce the correct output for all valid input data.
