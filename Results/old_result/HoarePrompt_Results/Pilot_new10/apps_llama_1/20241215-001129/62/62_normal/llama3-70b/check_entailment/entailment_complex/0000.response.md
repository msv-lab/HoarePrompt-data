Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the comparison of two numbers represented in different bases, as described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input for both numbers, including the number of digits and the base for each number.
2. **Digit Conversion**: The `func_1` function correctly converts the digits of each number from their respective bases to decimal (base 10) using the formula: `result = result * base + digit`. This is a standard method for converting numbers from any base to decimal.
3. **Comparison**: The program compares the decimal equivalents of the two numbers and outputs the correct comparison result ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison.

The key aspects that ensure the program's correctness are:

* The `func_1` function correctly handles the conversion of digits to decimal, regardless of the base.
* The comparison logic after calling `func_1` for both numbers is straightforward and accurate.
* The problem description guarantees that both numbers are positive and non-zero, eliminating the need to handle special cases like zero or negative numbers.

Since the program accurately implements the steps described in the problem description and there are no apparent logical flaws or omissions, it is correct for all potential cases within the specified constraints (e.g., 2 ≤ base ≤ 40, digits are non-negative integers less than the base, and both numbers are positive and represented without leading zeroes).
