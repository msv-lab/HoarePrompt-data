To calculate the result, let's analyze the given information and the code.

Given:
- `digits` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 1 digit.
- `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40.
- For all `i` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`.
- `result` is initially 0.

The code snippet provided is:
```python
result = result * base + digit
```
However, the variable `digit` is not defined in the initial state. Assuming the intent was to use an element from the `digits` list, let's proceed with that assumption for the sake of providing a meaningful analysis. If `digit` is meant to represent a specific or any digit from the `digits` list, the operation would still follow the same logic but would be applied to that specific or any digit.

Impact on the program:
- The value of `result` is updated based on its current value, the value of `base`, and the value of `digit`.
- The values of `digits` and `base` remain unchanged.

Calculation:
- Initially, `result` is 0.
- After the operation, `result` becomes `0 * base + digit = digit`. This is because any number multiplied by 0 is 0, and then `digit` is added to this product.

Given that `digit` must be one of the elements from the `digits` list and that 0 ≤ `digit` < `base`, the new value of `result` will be equal to the value of `digit`, which is one of the non-negative integers less than `base`.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of non-negative integers with at least 1 digit, `base` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `base` ≤ 40, for all `i` in `digits`, 0 ≤ `digits[i]` < `base`, and `result` equals one of the `digits` values (a non-negative integer less than `base`).**
