The function accepts a list of non-negative integers `digits` and an integer `base`, calculates and returns the decimal equivalent of the number represented by `digits` in base `base` without any error checking or handling, regardless of whether `base` is between 2 and 40 or each digit in `digits` is less than `base`.
