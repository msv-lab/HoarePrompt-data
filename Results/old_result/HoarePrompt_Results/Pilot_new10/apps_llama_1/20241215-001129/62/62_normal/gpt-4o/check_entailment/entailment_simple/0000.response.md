Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description and accurately compares two numbers represented in different bases. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input from the user, which includes the number of digits in each number, the base of each number, and the digits themselves. This is done using the `input()` and `map()` functions, which are used to convert the input strings into integers.

2. **Base Conversion**: The program defines a function `func_1()` that converts a number from any base between 2 and 40 to its decimal equivalent. This function works by iterating through each digit in the input list, multiplying the current decimal value by the base, and then adding the current digit. This is a standard algorithm for converting a number from any base to decimal.

3. **Comparison**: After converting both numbers to their decimal equivalents, the program compares them using simple conditional statements. If the first number is less than the second number, it prints '<'. If the first number is greater than the second number, it prints '>'. If the two numbers are equal, it prints '='.

The program handles all possible cases, including numbers with different numbers of digits and different bases. The use of the `*` operator to multiply the decimal value by the base and the `+` operator to add the current digit ensures that the conversion to decimal is accurate for all bases between 2 and 40.

Overall, the program is a straightforward and efficient solution to the problem, and it accurately handles all possible inputs. It meets the problem description and is therefore correct.
