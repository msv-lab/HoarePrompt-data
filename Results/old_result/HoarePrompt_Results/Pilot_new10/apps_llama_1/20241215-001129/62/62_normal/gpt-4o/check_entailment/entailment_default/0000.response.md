Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to be correct. It correctly reads the input, converts the given numbers from their respective bases to decimal, and then compares them. The function `func_1` calculates the decimal equivalent of a number represented by a list of digits in a given base. This function works by iterating through each digit, multiplying the current decimal value by the base, and then adding the current digit.

The comparison of the two decimal numbers is done correctly, and the code prints '<' if the first number is less than the second, '>' if the first number is greater than the second, and '=' if the numbers are equal.

The output hints agree with the code and do not indicate any potential issues. The code handles the conversion from any base between 2 and 40 and does not have any issues with the digits being less than the base, as stated in the output hints.

The provided examples in the problem description also work correctly with this code. For instance, in the first example, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 and Y = 47_10, so the code correctly prints '='. 

In general, the code should work correctly for all potential cases, as it correctly handles the conversion of numbers from any base between 2 and 40 to decimal and then compares them. There are no obvious cases where the code would not work as expected according to the problem description.
