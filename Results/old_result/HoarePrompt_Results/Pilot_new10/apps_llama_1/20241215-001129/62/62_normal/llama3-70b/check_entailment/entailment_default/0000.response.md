Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the problem description. It reads the input, converts the numbers from their respective bases to decimal, and then compares them.

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal equivalent of a number represented in a given base. It does this by iterating over the digits of the number from most significant to least significant, multiplying the current result by the base, and adding the current digit. This is the standard way to convert a number from any base to decimal.

The main part of the code reads the input, calls `func_1` to convert the numbers to decimal, and then compares the results. The output is then printed as '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison.

The output hints agree with the code and do not indicate any potential issues. The function `func_1` is able to handle any integer base and any list of integers, although the result may not be accurate if the base is outside the range 2-40 or if the digits contain negative integers. However, the problem description guarantees that the base will be between 2 and 40, and that the digits will be non-negative.

The examples provided in the problem description also seem to be handled correctly by the code. For example, in the first sample, X = 101111_2 = 47_10 = Y, so the output is '='. In the second sample, X = 102_3 = 11_10 and Y = 24_5 = 14_10, so the output is '<'. In the third sample, X = FF4007A_16 and Y = 4803150_9, so the output is '>'. 

Overall, the code seems to be correct and should work for all potential cases.
