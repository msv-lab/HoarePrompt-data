The code `decimal_value = 0` initializes a variable `decimal_value` and sets its value to 0. This operation does not affect the values of `digits` and `base`.

Output State: **`digits` is a list of non-negative integers, `base` is an integer between 2 and 40 (inclusive), where each digit in `digits` is less than `base`, and `decimal_value` is 0**
