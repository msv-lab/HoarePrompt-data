Postcondition: ***`x` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, if `digit_sum` > `max_sum`, then `digit_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 2. If `digit_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, then the values of `digit_sum`, `max_sum`, and `max_num` remain unchanged as 2, 1, and 1 respectively.***
