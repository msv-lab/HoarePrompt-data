The code introduces a new variable `max_num` and initializes it to 0. The value of `x` remains unchanged as it is a positive integer input by the user, such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18. The value of `max_sum` also remains unchanged, which is 0.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 0, and `max_num` is 0**
