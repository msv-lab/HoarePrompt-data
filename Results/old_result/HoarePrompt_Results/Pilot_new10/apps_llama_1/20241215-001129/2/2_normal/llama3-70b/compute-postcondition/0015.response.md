To determine the output state, we first need to calculate the new value of `digit_sum` based on the given code.

Given that `i` is 3, we convert `i` to a string to calculate the sum of its digits. Since `i` is 3, the string representation of `i` is '3'. The sum of the digits in '3' is simply 3, because there is only one digit.

So, `digit_sum` becomes 3.

Now, comparing this new `digit_sum` (which is 3) with `max_sum` (which is initially 1 in the case where `digit_sum` is not greater than `max_sum`, or 2 if `digit_sum` was greater than `max_sum`), we see that 3 is indeed greater than both possible initial values of `max_sum` (1 or 2).

Thus, `max_sum` should be updated to the value of `digit_sum`, which is 3, and `max_num` should be updated to the value of `i`, which is 3.

The initial condition regarding `x` does not affect the calculation of `digit_sum`, `max_sum`, or `max_num`, so `x` remains unchanged as a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18.

Therefore, after executing the given code:

- `x` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18,
- `i` is 3,
- `digit_sum` is 3,
- `max_sum` is 3,
- `max_num` is 3.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 3 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 3, `digit_sum` is 3, `max_sum` is 3, `max_num` is 3**
