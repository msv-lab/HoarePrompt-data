The code updates the `max_sum` variable to be equal to `digit_sum`. The initial state states that `digit_sum` is 2. 

Therefore, `max_sum` becomes 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

So, `x` remains a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` remains 2, `digit_sum` remains 2, `max_num` remains 1.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `i` is 2, `digit_sum` is 2, `max_sum` is 2, `max_num` is 1**
