You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Anton has the integer x. He is interested what positive integer, which doesn't exceed x, has the maximum sum of digits.

Your task is to help Anton and to find the integer that interests him. If there are several such integers, determine the biggest of them. 


-----Input-----

The first line contains the positive integer x (1 ≤ x ≤ 10^18) — the integer which Anton has. 


-----Output-----

Print the positive integer which doesn't exceed x and has the maximum sum of digits. If there are several such integers, print the biggest of them. Printed integer must not contain leading zeros.


-----Examples-----
Input
100

Output
99

Input
48

Output
48

Input
521

Output
499
Program:
```
def func():
    x = int(input())
    max_sum = 0
    max_num = 0
    for i in range(1, x + 1):
        digit_sum = sum((int(digit) for digit in str(i)))
        if digit_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = digit_sum
            max_num = i
    print(max_num)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not work correctly for large inputs. The program tries to iterate over all numbers from 1 to the given input `x`, which can be very large (up to 10^18). This approach is inefficient and may cause the program to run forever or exceed the maximum allowed time limit for large inputs.

For example, if the input is 10^18, the program will try to iterate over 10^18 numbers, which is impractical. 

A correct approach would be to start from the given number `x` and try to find the largest number that does not exceed `x` and has the maximum sum of digits. This can be done by iterating over all numbers starting from `x` and going down.

Here is an example of a correct Python program:
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    max_sum = 0
    max_num = 0
    for i in range(x, 0, -1):
        digit_sum = sum((int(digit) for digit in str(i)))
        if digit_sum > max_sum:
            max_sum = digit_sum
            max_num = i
    print(max_num)
```
Or, we can also use a more efficient approach by constructing the number with the maximum sum of digits from left to right. For example, we can start with the largest possible digit (9) and try to append it to the current number as many times as possible without exceeding `x`. 
```python
def func():
    x = int(input())
    s = str(x)
    n = len(s)
    max_num = 0
    for i in range(n, 0, -1):
        num = int('9' * i)
        if num <= x:
            max_num = num
            break
    print(max_num)
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function prompts the user for a positive integer input `x`, calculates the sum of digits for each number from 1 to `x`, and prints the number with the maximum sum of digits; it assumes the input is valid and within the range 1 to 10^18, without explicitly handling edge cases of invalid inputs or very large numbers. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
