Since `max_sum` is assigned the value of `digit_sum`, and the current value of `digit_sum` is initially 1 and greater than the current value of `max_sum` which is 0, `max_sum` becomes 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 1, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 1, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1**
