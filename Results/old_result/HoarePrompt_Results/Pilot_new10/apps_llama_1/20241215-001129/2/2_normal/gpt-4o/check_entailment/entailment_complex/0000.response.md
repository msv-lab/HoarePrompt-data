Correctness: **True**

The given program always does what the problem description asks for. Here's why:

1. It first takes an integer `x` as input and converts it to a string `x_str`.
2. If the first digit of `x_str` is not '1', it generates a candidate number by subtracting 1 from the first digit and appending '9' to the remaining places. This candidate number has the maximum possible sum of digits without exceeding `x`.
3. If the first digit of `x_str` is '1', it generates a candidate number by appending '9' to the remaining places (i.e., it tries to maximize the sum of digits by filling the remaining places with '9').
4. The program then calculates the sum of digits of both `x` and the candidate number using the function `func_1`.
5. Finally, it compares the sum of digits of `x` and the candidate number and prints the one with the maximum sum of digits. If there's a tie, it prints the larger number, which is `x` in this case.

This approach ensures that the program always finds the positive integer that doesn't exceed `x` and has the maximum sum of digits. If there are multiple such integers, it prints the largest one.

The key insight here is that the program doesn't need to try all possible numbers less than or equal to `x`. It only needs to consider a single candidate number that has the maximum possible sum of digits without exceeding `x`. This candidate number can be constructed by either subtracting 1 from the first digit of `x` and filling the remaining places with '9' or by filling all places with '9' (if the first digit of `x` is '1'). The comparison with `x` then ensures that the program prints the correct result.
