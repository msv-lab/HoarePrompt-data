The value of `digit_sum` is calculated as the sum of the digits of `i`. Since `i` is 1, the sum of its digits is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1.

Output State: **`x` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `x` ≤ 10^18, `max_sum` is 0, `max_num` is 0, `i` is 1, `digit_sum` is 1**
