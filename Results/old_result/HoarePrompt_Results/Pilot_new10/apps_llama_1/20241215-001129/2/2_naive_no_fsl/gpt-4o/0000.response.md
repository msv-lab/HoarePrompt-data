Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. It does not work correctly for cases when the input number starts with '1' and has other digits greater than '9'. 

For example, the input 199 should output 199, but the given code will output 9 * (number of digits - 1) = 9. However, a more significant issue arises in cases like 1099. The code will output 99 (by just taking 9 * (number of digits - 1)), whereas the correct output should be 999.

The problem with the code is in its approach to find the candidate number. It only checks two cases: one where the first digit of the input number is '1', and one where it's not. When the first digit is '1', the code simply appends '9's to get the candidate, which is incorrect as shown above. 

To correctly solve the problem, the code should find the largest number with the maximum sum of digits that is less than or equal to the input number. If the code checked all possible numbers less than or equal to the input number, it would be able to find the correct answer. However, due to time complexity, this approach might not be practical.

Another potential issue is that the function `func_1` is called after it is used, which would lead to a NameError. The function definition should be placed before its first usage.

Here is an example where the code does not work as expected: 

Input:
1099

Expected output:
999

Actual output:
99
