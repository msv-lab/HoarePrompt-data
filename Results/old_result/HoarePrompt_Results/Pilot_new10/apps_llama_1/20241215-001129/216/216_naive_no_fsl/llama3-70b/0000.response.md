Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not correctly solve the problem described. The issue with the code lies in the fact that it simply counts the total number of lowercase letters in the input string `s`, which does not consider the condition that there should be no uppercase letters between the positions in the "pretty set" of indices.

For instance, given the input string "aBa", the code will output `2`, which is incorrect because there is an uppercase 'B' between the two lowercase letters, violating the conditions for a "pretty set" as defined in the problem statement. According to the problem description, the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions should be `1` in this case, since taking both 'a's would result in having an uppercase 'B' in between them, which is not allowed. 

The code fails to account for these constraints, making it incorrect for all inputs where the presence of uppercase letters between lowercase letters affects the size of the "pretty set". 

A correct solution would involve implementing logic to check for these conditions, possibly involving iterative or recursive approaches to evaluate all possible combinations of lowercase letter indices and determining the maximum set size that meets the criteria.
