You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program seems to correctly implement the logic required to find the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions. It iterates over the input string, adding lowercase letters to the current set and incrementing the count if the letter is not already in the set. Whenever it encounters an uppercase letter, it updates the maximum count if necessary, clears the current set, and resets the count. This approach ensures that the program correctly handles the conditions for a pretty set, including the presence of uppercase letters between positions from the set.

The program also handles edge cases, such as a string with no lowercase letters, in which case it will correctly output 0. Additionally, it correctly handles the case where there are multiple consecutive uppercase letters, as it resets the current set and count after each uppercase letter.

The program's logic is also consistent with the provided examples, and it produces the correct output for each of them. Therefore, based on the given examples and the problem description, the program appears to be correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines: the first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is the maximum count of unique lowercase letters in any segment of `s` separated by non-lowercase characters, `current_set` is either empty (if the last character of `s` is not a lowercase letter) or contains the unique lowercase letters from the last segment of `s` (if the last character is a lowercase letter), and `current_count` is either 0 (if the last character of `s` is not a lowercase letter) or represents the count of unique lowercase letters in the last segment of `s` (if the last character is a lowercase letter).
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a positive integer n and a string s of length n, finds the maximum count of unique lowercase letters in any segment of s separated by non-lowercase characters, and prints this maximum count, handling various edge cases including strings with no lowercase letters, strings with a single segment of lowercase letters, and strings where the last character is a lowercase letter.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
