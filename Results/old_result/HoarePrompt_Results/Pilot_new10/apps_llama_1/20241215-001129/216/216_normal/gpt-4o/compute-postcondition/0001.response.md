The code assigns the value of the next input to the variable `s`. Since the length of `s` is `n`, the input string `s` will be of length `n`. The value of `n` is still a positive integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), but now the string `s` has been read and is a string of length `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n`**
