The given code creates a list `lowercase` containing the indices of characters in the string `s` that are lowercase. 

The value of `n` is not affected by this code, so it remains an input integer. The string `s` is also unchanged, it remains the new input string.

The list `lowercase` is assigned the value of a list comprehension that iterates over the string `s` and includes the index `i` of each character `c` that is a lowercase letter, as determined by the `islower()` method.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `lowercase` is a list of indices of lowercase characters in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `lowercase` is a list of indices of lowercase characters in `s`.**
