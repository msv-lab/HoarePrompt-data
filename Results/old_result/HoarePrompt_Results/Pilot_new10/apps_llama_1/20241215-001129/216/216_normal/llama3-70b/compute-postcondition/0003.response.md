The code `print(len(lowercase))` prints the length of the `lowercase` list, which contains the indices of lowercase characters in the string `s`. The `len()` function returns the number of elements in the list. 

Since `n` is an input integer and `s` is the new input string, and `lowercase` is a list of indices of lowercase characters in `s`, after the print statement, `n` is still an input integer, `s` is still the new input string, `lowercase` is still a list of indices of lowercase characters in `s`, and the length of `lowercase` has been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `lowercase` is a list of indices of lowercase characters in `s`, and the length of `lowercase` has been printed as an output.**
