Correctness: **True**

The given program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Reading Input**: The program correctly reads the input as specified - an integer `n` representing the length of the string, and a string `s` consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

2. **Initialization**: The program initializes variables to keep track of the maximum count of unique lowercase letters (`max_count`), a set to store unique lowercase letters in the current segment (`current_set`), and a count of unique lowercase letters in the current segment (`current_count`).

3. **Processing the String**: The program iterates through each character in the string. If the character is lowercase and not already in `current_set`, it adds the character to `current_set` and increments `current_count`. If the character is uppercase, it updates `max_count` if the current segment's count is higher, clears `current_set`, and resets `current_count`. This logic effectively identifies segments of the string where there are no uppercase letters between lowercase letters and keeps track of the unique lowercase letters in these segments.

4. **Handling the Last Segment**: After iterating through the string, the program checks one last time to update `max_count` in case the last segment of the string (which ends without an uppercase letter) contains the maximum number of unique lowercase letters.

5. **Output**: Finally, the program prints `max_count`, which represents the maximum number of elements in a "pretty set" according to the problem description. A "pretty set" being a set of positions in the string where the letters are all distinct and lowercase, and there are no uppercase letters in the string situated between these positions.

This approach correctly identifies the maximum number of unique lowercase letters that can be found in segments of the string separated by uppercase letters, adhering to the conditions of a "pretty set" as defined by the problem. Therefore, the program meets all the requirements outlined in the problem description.
