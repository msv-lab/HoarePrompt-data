You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp loves lowercase letters and dislikes uppercase ones. Once he got a string s consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.

Let A be a set of positions in the string. Let's call it pretty if following conditions are met:  letters on positions from A in the string are all distinct and lowercase;  there are no uppercase letters in the string which are situated between positions from A (i.e. there is no such j that s[j] is an uppercase letter, and a_1 < j < a_2 for some a_1 and a_2 from A). 

Write a program that will determine the maximum number of elements in a pretty set of positions.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200) — length of string s.

The second line contains a string s consisting of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.


-----Output-----

Print maximum number of elements in pretty set of positions for string s.


-----Examples-----
Input
11
aaaaBaabAbA

Output
2

Input
12
zACaAbbaazzC

Output
3

Input
3
ABC

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first example the desired positions might be 6 and 8 or 7 and 8. Positions 6 and 7 contain letters 'a', position 8 contains letter 'b'. The pair of positions 1 and 8 is not suitable because there is an uppercase letter 'B' between these position.

In the second example desired positions can be 7, 8 and 11. There are other ways to choose pretty set consisting of three elements.

In the third example the given string s does not contain any lowercase letters, so the answer is 0.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it effectively implements a solution that aligns with the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it works correctly for every potential case:

1. **Initialization**: The program starts by reading the length of the string `n` and the string `s` itself. It initializes `max_count` to 0, which will store the maximum number of distinct lowercase letters found in any "pretty set" of positions. It also initializes an empty set `current_set` to keep track of distinct lowercase letters encountered in the current "pretty set" and `current_count` to the number of such letters.

2. **Iterating Through the String**: The program iterates through each character `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is a lowercase letter and it's not already in `current_set`, it adds `char` to `current_set` and increments `current_count`. This ensures that `current_set` always contains distinct lowercase letters and `current_count` accurately reflects the number of such letters in the current "pretty set".

3. **Encountering Uppercase Letters**: When the program encounters an uppercase letter, it updates `max_count` with the maximum of its current value and `current_count`. This effectively records the size of the largest "pretty set" encountered so far. It then clears `current_set` and resets `current_count` to 0. This is because the occurrence of an uppercase letter signifies the end of the current "pretty set" (since no uppercase letters can be between positions in a "pretty set"), and we start fresh.

4. **Finalizing `max_count`**: After iterating through the entire string, the program updates `max_count` one last time to account for the possibility that the largest "pretty set" might occur at the end of the string, where no following uppercase letter triggers an update.

The program's logic correctly handles all scenarios as described:

- **Starting with Uppercase Letters**: If the string starts with uppercase letters, `current_set` and `current_count` remain empty and 0, respectively, until the first lowercase letter is encountered, correctly handling this case.

- **No Lowercase Letters**: If the string contains no lowercase letters, `current_count` remains 0, and `max_count` is not updated, resulting in an output of 0, which is correct.

- **Pretty Sets Separated by Uppercase Letters**: The program correctly identifies and distinguishes between different "pretty sets" that are separated by uppercase letters, ensuring that each set's contribution to `max_count` is accurately assessed.

- **Multiple Lowercase Letters**: The use of a set to store lowercase letters in `current_set` ensures that duplicate letters are ignored, adhering to the condition that all letters in a "pretty set" must be distinct.

Given the comprehensive handling of various scenarios and the alignment with the problem description, the program is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input consists of two lines: the first line contains a positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200), and the second line contains a string s of length n consisting only of lowercase and uppercase Latin letters.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    max_count = 0
    current_set = set()
    current_count = 0
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            if char not in current_set:
                current_set.add(char)
                current_count += 1
        else:
            max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
            current_set.clear()
            current_count = 0
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a string of length `n`, `max_count` is the maximum count of unique lowercase letters in any segment of `s` separated by non-lowercase characters, `current_set` is either empty (if the last character of `s` is not a lowercase letter) or contains the unique lowercase letters from the last segment of `s` (if the last character is a lowercase letter), and `current_count` is either 0 (if the last character of `s` is not a lowercase letter) or represents the count of unique lowercase letters in the last segment of `s` (if the last character is a lowercase letter).
    max_count = max(max_count, current_count)
    print(max_count)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
