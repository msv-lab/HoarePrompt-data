Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200, `s` is a string of length `n` that must have at least 1 character. If `char` is not in `current_set`, then `current_set` contains the first character in the string `s`, `current_count` is 1, and `char` is in `current_set`. If `char` is already in `current_set`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `max_count` being 0, `current_set` being an empty set, `current_count` being 0, and `char` being the first character in the string `s`.**
