According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `(n + 1)` is a multiple of 10 (i.e., `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`), the loop can execute. This means `n + 1` must end in 0, so `n` must end in 9. 

Right before the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, equal to the input integer. However, this does not guarantee that `n` ends in 9. To ensure the loop can execute at least once, `n` needs to be adjusted so that it ends in 9.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, equal to the input integer, and `n` must end in 9, `max_9s` is 0**
