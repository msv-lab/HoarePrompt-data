Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The problem requires finding the number of pairs of shovels such that their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. However, the given program does not correctly achieve this goal.

The issue with the program lies in the condition `if (i + (n - i)) % 10 ** (len(str(i + (n - i))) - 1) == 0:`. This condition checks if the sum of the costs of the shovels `i` and `n - i` is divisible by `10` raised to the power of the number of digits in `i + (n - i)` minus 1. This condition does not necessarily guarantee that the sum will end with the maximum possible number of nines.

For example, when `n = 14`, the program will not correctly count the pairs of shovels that end with one nine. The correct pairs are `(1, 8)`, `(2, 7)`, `(3, 6)`, `(4, 5)`, `(5, 14)`, `(6, 13)`, `(7, 12)`, `(8, 11)`, and `(9, 10)`, but the program will not correctly identify these pairs.

A correct implementation would involve iterating over all possible pairs of shovels and checking if their total cost ends with the maximum possible number of nines. The program would need to keep track of the maximum number of nines seen so far and count the number of pairs that achieve this maximum. 

Here is a correct implementation in Python:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_nines = 0
    count = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            total = i + j
            nines = 0
            while total % 10 == 9:
                nines += 1
                total //= 10
            if nines > max_nines:
                max_nines = nines
                count = 1
            elif nines == max_nines:
                count += 1
    print(count)

func()
```
This program correctly counts the number of pairs of shovels that end with the maximum possible number of nines.
