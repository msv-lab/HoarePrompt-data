The value of `max_9s` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `max_9s` is 0, so the new value of `max_9s` is 1. The state of the variable `n` is not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, equal to the input integer, and `n` must end in 9, `max_9s` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, equal to the input integer, and `n` must end in 9, `max_9s` is 1**
