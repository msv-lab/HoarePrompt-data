The code `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10, effectively removing the last digit of `n`. 

Given that `n` is the input integer without its last digit (which was 9) and `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, this implies that `n + 1` ends in 0. Since `n` does not have its last digit (which is 9), `n` must end in a digit that when incremented by 1 and then having 9 appended results in a number ending in 0. However, the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` actually implies that `n` itself, when incremented by 1, directly results in a number ending in 0, because we are considering `n` without its last digit (9). This logic was initially misleading because the correct interpretation should be: `n` is such that when you append 9 to it (to form the original number), `n + 1` (without appending 9) would end in 0, which doesn't hold under normal logic since appending 9 and then checking divisibility by 10 doesn't directly correlate with `n + 1` being divisible by 10 without the last digit being considered.

The given condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` directly implies that `n` ends in 9, but since we're considering `n` without its last digit (which was 9), this condition actually refers to the original number before removing the last digit. However, the key insight from `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` should be that `n + 1` is a multiple of 10, meaning it ends in 0, but this condition applies after `n` has been defined as excluding its last digit (9). Thus, `n` must originally end in a digit such that adding 1 to it results in a number ending in 0, but since we removed the last digit (9), we're looking at a scenario where `n` itself does not directly influence the condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` in a straightforward manner without considering the removed digit.

Given `n //= 10`, we remove the last digit from `n`. However, since `n` was already defined as excluding its last digit (which was 9), this operation effectively removes the digit before the last digit (which was 9).

The value of `max_9s` is not affected by the operation on `n`.

Since `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, and considering `n` without its last digit (9), when we perform `n //= 10`, we're essentially looking at how `n` changes. The condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` is still valid after the operation because it refers to the property of `n + 1` being divisible by 10, which does not directly change with the removal of another digit from `n`.

Therefore, after `n //= 10`, `n` has been further reduced by removing one more digit (the one before the last digit which was 9), and `max_9s` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer without its last two digits (the last being 9 and the one before it), `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, `max_9s` is 2**
