The given code snippet is `print(pairs)`. This statement prints the value of `pairs` but does not modify it or any other variable. The value of `pairs` is `(n + 1) * max_9s`. 

After the print statement is executed, the values of `n`, `max_9s`, and `pairs` remain unchanged. The print statement simply outputs the value of `pairs` to the console.

Output State: **`n` is the original `n` with all trailing 9s removed, `max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original `n`, `pairs` is `(n + 1) * max_9s`, and the value of `pairs` has been printed**
