Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `i` is 2. If `(i + (n - i))` is divisible by `10` raised to the power of the number of digits in `(i + (n - i))` minus 1, then `ans` is either 1 or 2. Since there is no else part that updates the variables, if the condition is not met, the values of `n`, `i`, and `ans` remain as they were before the if statement, with `ans` being either 0 or 1.**
