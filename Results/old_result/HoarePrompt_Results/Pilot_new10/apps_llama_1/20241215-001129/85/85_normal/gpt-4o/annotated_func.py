#State of the program right berfore the function call: no explicit input variables are given in the function definition, but based on the problem description, we can infer that the function takes an integer n as input, where n is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2 and represents the number of shovels in Polycarp's shop.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    max_9s = 0
    while (n + 1) % 10 == 0:
        max_9s += 1
        
        n //= 10
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is the original `n` with all trailing 9s removed, `max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original `n`.
    pairs = (n + 1) * max_9s
    print(pairs)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` as input from the user, counts the number of trailing 9s in `n`, calculates the value `(n + 1) * max_9s` where `max_9s` is the count of trailing 9s, and prints this value, assuming `n` ends with one or more 9s; if `n` does not end with a 9, `max_9s` will be 0, and the function will simply print `n + 1` multiplied by 0, which is 0; the function does not handle invalid inputs or edge cases explicitly.
