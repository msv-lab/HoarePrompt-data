The code `max_9s += 1` increments the value of `max_9s` by 1. The initial value of `max_9s` is 2, so after the increment, `max_9s` becomes 3. The conditions `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` and the definition of `n` as the input integer without its last two digits (the last being 9 and the one before it) are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer without its last two digits (the last being 9 and the one before it), `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, `max_9s` is 3**
