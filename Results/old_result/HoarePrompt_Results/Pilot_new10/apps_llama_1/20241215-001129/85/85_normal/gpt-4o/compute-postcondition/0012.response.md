`pairs` is assigned the value of `(n + 1)` multiplied by `max_9s`. The value of `n` is the original `n` with all trailing 9s removed, and the value of `max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is the original `n` with all trailing 9s removed, `max_9s` is the number of trailing 9s in the original `n`, `pairs` is `(n + 1) * max_9s`**
