According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is at least 4. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 3, and for the loop to execute again `n` must be at least 6 (because 3 < n // 2 + 1 translates to 3 < n / 2 + 1, 3 - 1 < n / 2, 2 < n / 2, 2 * 2 < n, 4 < n, n must be at least 6 for i to be 3 and the condition to hold).
State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 6, `i` is 3**
