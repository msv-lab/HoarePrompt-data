To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the initial state and the operation performed by the code.

Given that `n` is the input integer without its last two digits, and the last two digits are 9 and the one before it, we can represent the original input integer as `n * 100 + 10 * x + 9`, where `x` is the last digit before the 9. However, we are told `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`, which means `n + 1` ends in 0. Therefore, `n` must end in 9.

The operation `n //= 10` removes the last digit of `n`, effectively performing integer division of `n` by 10.

Since `n` ends in 9 (as deduced from `(n + 1) % 10 == 0`), after performing `n //= 10`, `n` will be the integer part of `n` without its last digit, which was 9.

The condition `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` after the operation `n //= 10` should be re-evaluated based on the new value of `n`. Since the last digit (9) has been removed, the new `n` will not satisfy `(n + 1) % 10 == 0` in the same way as before. Instead, we should look at the new `n` as being the result of the division, which does not necessarily end in 9 anymore.

`max_9s` is 3 and does not change with the operation.

Thus, the output state is: `n` is the input integer without its last three digits (two of which are known to be 9 and the one before it, where `n` before the operation ended in 9), `max_9s` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is the result of the original `n` integer divided by 10 (losing its last digit which was 9), `max_9s` is 3**
