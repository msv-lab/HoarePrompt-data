Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly because it only checks pairs of shovels where one shovel's cost is `i` and the other shovel's cost is `n - i`. However, the problem statement does not restrict the pairs to this format. It only requires that the sum of the costs of the two shovels ends with the maximum possible number of nines.

For example, if `n = 10`, the program will only check the pairs `(1, 9)`, `(2, 8)`, `(3, 7)`, `(4, 6)`, and `(5, 5)`. However, it will not check the pair `(6, 4)`, which also has a sum that ends with a maximum possible number of nines.

Additionally, the program's logic for checking the maximum possible number of nines is also incorrect. It checks if the sum of the costs is divisible by `10` raised to the power of the number of digits in the sum minus one. However, this is not the correct way to check for the maximum possible number of nines.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to find the maximum possible number of nines that can be achieved by summing the costs of two shovels, and then count the number of pairs that achieve this maximum. 

A correct approach would be to iterate over all possible pairs of shovels, calculate their sum, and keep track of the maximum number of nines seen so far. Then, iterate over all pairs again and count the number of pairs that achieve this maximum number of nines. 

Here is a corrected version of the code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    ans = 0
    max_nines = 0
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
            sum = i + j
            nines = 0
            while sum % 10 == 9:
                nines += 1
                sum = sum // 10
            if nines > max_nines:
                max_nines = nines
                ans = 1
            elif nines == max_nines:
                ans += 1
    print(ans)
```
