Correctness: **True**.

The given program correctly solves the problem by calculating the values of all 12 expressions and finding the maximum value. The program uses the built-in `max` function with a `key` argument to find the maximum value and returns the corresponding expression.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including cases where the maximum value is achieved by multiple expressions. In such cases, the program returns the first expression that achieves the maximum value, as required by the problem statement.

The program also correctly handles the input and output requirements, including reading the input values from the standard input and printing the result to the standard output.

I have not been able to find any input or potential case where the program does not work as expected. The program correctly calculates the values of all expressions and returns the correct result. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
