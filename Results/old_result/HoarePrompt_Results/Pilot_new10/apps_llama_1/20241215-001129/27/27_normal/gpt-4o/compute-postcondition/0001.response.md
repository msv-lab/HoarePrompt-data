The code `x, y, z = map(float, input().split())` reads a line of input from the standard input, splits it into three parts using space as the delimiter, and converts each part into a floating-point number using the `float()` function. The `map()` function applies the `float()` function to each part of the input.

The input is a string containing three space-separated real numbers x, y, and z, each with exactly one digit after the decimal point, such that 0.1 <= x, y, z <= 200.0.

After executing the code, the values of x, y, and z are updated to the three real numbers read from the input.

Output State: **`x` is a float between 0.1 and 200.0, `y` is a float between 0.1 and 200.0, `z` is a float between 0.1 and 200.0, each with exactly one digit after the decimal point, and the input is read from the standard input using `sys.stdin.read`.**
