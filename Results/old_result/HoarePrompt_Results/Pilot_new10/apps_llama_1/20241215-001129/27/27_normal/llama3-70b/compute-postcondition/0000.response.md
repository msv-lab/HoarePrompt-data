The input values are split into three variables: `x`, `y`, and `z`. These values are floats and have exactly one digit after the decimal point. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are real numbers between 0.1 and 200.0 (inclusive).

Output State: **`x` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point, `y` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point, `z` is a real number between 0.1 and 200.0 with one digit after the decimal point**
