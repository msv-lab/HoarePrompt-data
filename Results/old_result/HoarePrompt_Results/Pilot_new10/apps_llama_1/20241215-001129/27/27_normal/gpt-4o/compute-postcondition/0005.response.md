The function `func_1` accepts no parameters. However, it is designed to process an input string containing three space-separated real numbers x, y, and z. The input string is not passed as a parameter to the function, so we assume it is handled internally within the function. x, y, and z are real numbers, each with exactly one digit after the decimal point, such that 0.1 <= x, y, z <= 200.0. 

Since the specific output of the function is not provided, we cannot determine the exact return value of the function.


Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters, processes an internal input string of three space-separated real numbers, and returns an unspecified value based on the processed input.**
