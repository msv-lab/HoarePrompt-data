Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It first reads in the three real numbers x, y, and z from the input, then calculates the 12 different expressions as specified. The expressions are stored in a list `a`, and the corresponding string representations are stored in a list `b`.

The program then uses the `index` method to find the index of the maximum value in the list `a`, and prints the corresponding string representation from the list `b`. This ensures that the program prints the expression that corresponds to the maximum value, as required by the problem description.

The use of the `index` method ensures that if there are multiple maximum values, the program will print the one that comes first in the list, which is also in line with the problem description.

One potential concern could be the handling of cases where the maximum value occurs multiple times. However, since the problem description specifies that the program should print the first occurrence of the maximum value, and the `index` method returns the index of the first occurrence, the program behaves correctly in this case.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases. 

Here's a minor improvement for better error handling, but this does not change the fact that the original program meets the requirements of the problem description:

```python
def func():
    try:
        x, y, z = map(float, input().split())
        if not all(0.1 <= num <= 200.0 for num in (x, y, z)):
            raise ValueError
        a1 = x ** y ** z
        a2 = x ** z ** y
        a3 = (x ** y) ** z
        a4 = (x ** z) ** y
        a5 = y ** x ** z
        a6 = y ** z ** x
        a7 = (y ** x) ** z
        a8 = (y ** z) ** x
        a9 = z ** x ** y
        a10 = z ** y ** x
        a11 = (z ** x) ** y
        a12 = (z ** y) ** x
        a = [a1, a2, a3, a4, a5, a6, a7, a8, a9, a10, a11, a12]
        b = ['x^y^z', 'x^z^y', '(x^y)^z', '(x^z)^y', 'y^x^z', 'y^z^x', '(y^x)^z',
        '(y^z)^x', 'z^x^y', 'z^y^x', '(z^x)^y', '(z^y)^x']
        print(b[a.index(max(a))])
    except ValueError:
        print("Invalid input. Please enter three space-separated numbers between 0.1 and 200.0.")
