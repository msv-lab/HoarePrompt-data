The function `func` accepts no parameters, but it takes a list of three space-separated real numbers `x`, `y`, and `z` as input from the user, where `0.1 ≤ x, y, z ≤ 200.0`, and each of `x`, `y`, and `z` has exactly one digit after the decimal point. 

It calculates 12 different expressions involving exponentiation of these numbers and stores them in a list `a`. The expressions are of the form `x^y^z`, `x^z^y`, `(x^y)^z`, `(x^z)^y`, and their permutations with `x`, `y`, and `z`. 

It also maintains a list `b` of strings representing the corresponding expressions in a human-readable format.

The function then finds the maximum value among the calculated expressions, finds its index in the list `a`, and prints the corresponding expression from the list `b`. 

The function does not handle any potential exceptions that may occur during the input operation, such as the user entering non-numeric values or more or less than three numbers. 

It also does not validate whether the input numbers are within the specified range or have exactly one digit after the decimal point. 

The function assumes that the input operation will be successful and that the calculated expressions will not overflow or underflow.

Functionality: ** The function takes three space-separated real numbers as input, calculates 12 different exponentiation expressions, and prints the human-readable representation of the expression with the maximum value, without handling potential input exceptions or validation errors. **
