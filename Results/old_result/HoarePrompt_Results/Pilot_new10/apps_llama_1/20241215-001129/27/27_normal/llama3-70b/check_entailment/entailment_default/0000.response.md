Correctness: **True**

The provided Python code correctly implements the problem description. It takes three space-separated real numbers as input, calculates the 12 different exponentiation expressions, and prints the human-readable representation of the expression with the maximum value.

The code uses the built-in `max()` function to find the maximum value among the 12 expressions and the `index()` method to find the index of the maximum value in the list. It then uses this index to print the corresponding expression from the list `b`.

The code handles all potential cases, including duplicate maximum values, where it prints the first occurrence of the maximum value. The examples provided also demonstrate the correct behavior of the code.

The only potential issue could be with handling invalid inputs, such as non-numeric input or input outside the specified range. However, the problem description does not specify how to handle such cases, and the code assumes that the input will be valid.

Overall, the code correctly implements the problem description, and I could not find any case where it does not work as expected.
