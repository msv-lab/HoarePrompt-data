Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is 0, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `remaining_time` is updated based on the new `complete_tasks` and `subtasks_solved` is updated based on the new `complete_tasks`. If `time_used` is greater than `M`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, no additional changes are made.***
