The code is a `break` statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. This statement does not modify any variables. 

The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `time_used` is a value higher than the current value of `M`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
