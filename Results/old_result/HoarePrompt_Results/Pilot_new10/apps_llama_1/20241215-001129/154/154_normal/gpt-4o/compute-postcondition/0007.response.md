The value of `points` is calculated as `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`. The previous values of `complete_tasks` and `k` are used in the calculation. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, and if `time_used` is higher than `M`, the loop or if statement is terminated, otherwise, the program continues with the same state as the precondition.**
