The value of `dp[i][j]` is updated to be equal to `dp[i][j - 1]`. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is 1, `dp[2][1]` becomes equal to `dp[2][0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 1, `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9) and must be greater than 0, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[2][1]` equals `dp[2][0]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 1**
