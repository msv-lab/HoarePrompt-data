To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code. The code initializes a 2D list `dp` with dimensions `(k + 1) x (M + 1)`, where all elements are initialized to 0.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45)
- `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45)
- `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9)
- `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order

After executing the code:
- `dp` is a 2D list of size `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` where all elements are 0.
- The values of `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t` remain unchanged as they are not modified by the code.

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged initial conditions and the new state of `dp`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45), `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, and `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list initialized with all elements as 0**
