The code `dp[i][j] = dp[i][j - 1]` updates the value of `dp[i][j]` to be the same as `dp[i][j - 1]`. 

Since `i` is 1, `j` is 1, and `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list initialized with all elements as 0, `dp[i][j - 1]` is equivalent to `dp[1][0]`. Therefore, the value of `dp[1][1]` is updated to be 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 0, `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[1][1]` is 0 and all other elements are initially 0, `i` is 1, `j` is 1**
