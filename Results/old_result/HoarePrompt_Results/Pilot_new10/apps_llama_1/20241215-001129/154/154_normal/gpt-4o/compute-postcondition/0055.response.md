According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `complete_tasks` and `n`. If `complete_tasks` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is determined by external conditions, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` has been incremented by at least 1, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, and `remaining_time` is updated based on the solved subtasks. For the loop to execute again `complete_tasks` must be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is determined by external conditions, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` has been incremented by at least 1 and is now at least 1 more than its previous value, `time_used` is `(complete_tasks + 1) * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - (complete_tasks + 1)) * k`, and `remaining_time` is updated based on the solved subtasks**
