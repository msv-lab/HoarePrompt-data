According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `complete_tasks` and `n`. If `complete_tasks` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `complete_tasks` is a certain value and `n` is a positive integer. For the loop to execute again, `complete_tasks` must be increased by 1. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is 0, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points + subtasks_solved`, `complete_tasks` is increased by 1, `remaining_time` is updated based on the new `complete_tasks` and `subtasks_solved` is updated based on the new `complete_tasks`**
