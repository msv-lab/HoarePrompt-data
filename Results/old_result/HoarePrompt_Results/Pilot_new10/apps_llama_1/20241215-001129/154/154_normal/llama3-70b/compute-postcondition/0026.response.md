The value of `dp[i][j]` is assigned the value of `dp[i][j - 1]`. The previous values of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, and `i` and `j` are not changed, so the output state is: `n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 1, `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9) and must be greater than 1, `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[i][j]` equals `dp[i][j - 1]`, `i` is 2, `j` is 2.
