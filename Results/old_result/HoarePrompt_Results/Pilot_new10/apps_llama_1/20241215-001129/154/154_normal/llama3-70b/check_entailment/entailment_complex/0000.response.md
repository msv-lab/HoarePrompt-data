Correctness: **False**

The program does not accurately implement the problem description. 

The key issue lies in the fact that the program is designed to calculate the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within the time `M`, considering all `k` subtasks. However, it fails to account for the complete solution of tasks and the extra points earned from them. 

In the problem description, it's stated that if Polycarp completely solves a task (solves all `k` of its subtasks), he receives one extra point. The program attempts to calculate this with the line `print(sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1)) + sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i))`. However, this calculation is incorrect. 

The line `sum(dp[i][M] for i in range(k + 1))` calculates the sum of the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within `M` minutes for each `i` from `1` to `k`, which is not what the problem asks for. The problem asks for the maximum number of points that can be earned by solving subtasks and tasks.

Moreover, the line `sum(1 for i in range(k + 1) if dp[i][M] == i)` attempts to count the number of tasks that can be completely solved within `M` minutes. However, this is also incorrect because it's checking if the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within `M` minutes is equal to `i`, which is not a correct condition to check for complete task solution.

A correct approach would involve calculating the maximum number of points that can be earned by solving subtasks and tasks, considering the time constraints and the extra points earned from complete task solutions. The program does not accurately implement this logic.

To fix this, the program needs to be modified to correctly calculate the maximum number of points that can be earned, taking into account the time constraints and the extra points earned from complete task solutions. This would involve a more complex dynamic programming approach that considers the number of tasks and subtasks solved within the given time `M`. 

Here's a correct Python code snippet to calculate the maximum number of points that can be earned:
```python
def maxPoints(n, k, M, t):
    t.sort()
    dp = [[0] * (M + 1) for _ in range(n + 1)]
    
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(1, M + 1):
            for task in range(k + 1):
                if j >= sum(t[:task]):
                    dp[i][j] = max(dp[i][j], dp[i - 1][j - sum(t[:task])] + task + (task == k))
    
    return dp[n][M]

n, k, M = map(int, input().split())
t = list(map(int, input().split()))
print(maxPoints(n, k, M, t))
```
This code uses a dynamic programming approach to calculate the maximum number of points that can be earned by solving subtasks and tasks, considering the time constraints and the extra points earned from complete task solutions.
