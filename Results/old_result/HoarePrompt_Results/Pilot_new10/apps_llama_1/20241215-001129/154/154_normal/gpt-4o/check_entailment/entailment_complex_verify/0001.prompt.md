You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Polycarp takes part in a math show. He is given n tasks, each consists of k subtasks, numbered 1 through k. It takes him t_{j} minutes to solve the j-th subtask of any task. Thus, time required to solve a subtask depends only on its index, but not on the task itself. Polycarp can solve subtasks in any order.

By solving subtask of arbitrary problem he earns one point. Thus, the number of points for task is equal to the number of solved subtasks in it. Moreover, if Polycarp completely solves the task (solves all k of its subtasks), he recieves one extra point. Thus, total number of points he recieves for the complete solution of the task is k + 1.

Polycarp has M minutes of time. What is the maximum number of points he can earn?


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integer numbers n, k and M (1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2·10^9).

The second line contains k integer numbers, values t_{j} (1 ≤ t_{j} ≤ 1000000), where t_{j} is the time in minutes required to solve j-th subtask of any task.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum amount of points Polycarp can earn in M minutes.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4 11
1 2 3 4

Output
6

Input
5 5 10
1 2 4 8 16

Output
7



-----Note-----

In the first example Polycarp can complete the first task and spend 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 = 10 minutes. He also has the time to solve one subtask of the second task in one minute.

In the second example Polycarp can solve the first subtask of all five tasks and spend 5·1 = 5 minutes. Also he can solve the second subtasks of two tasks and spend 2·2 = 4 minutes. Thus, he earns 5 + 2 = 7 points in total.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        if time_used > M:
            break
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        subtasks_solved = 0
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
    return max_points


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program seems to correctly solve the problem described. It iterates through all possible numbers of complete tasks, calculates the remaining time, and then tries to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time. It also correctly limits the number of subtasks that can be solved to the number of remaining tasks.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program iterates through all possible numbers of complete tasks, from 0 to n. This ensures that it considers all possible cases where some tasks are completely solved and some are not.

2. For each number of complete tasks, it calculates the time used to solve these tasks and the remaining time. If the time used exceeds the total available time M, it breaks the loop because solving more tasks would only use more time.

3. The program then calculates the points earned for the completely solved tasks and tries to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time.

4. It correctly limits the number of subtasks that can be solved to the number of remaining tasks. This is done by the line `subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)`.

5. Finally, it updates the maximum points if the current points (points for complete tasks + points for subtasks) are greater than the current maximum.

The program seems to handle all possible cases correctly, including edge cases where n = 1, k = 1, or M = 0. It also correctly handles cases where it's optimal to solve some tasks completely and then solve some subtasks from the remaining tasks.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
k = int(data[1])
M = int(data[2])
t = list(map(int, data[3:3 + k]))
result = func_1(n, k, M, t)
print(result)

import sys

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer, M is a non-negative integer, and t is a list of k positive integers representing the time required to solve each subtask, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 45, 1 ≤ k ≤ 45, 0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9, and 1 ≤ t_j ≤ 1000000 for all 1 ≤ j ≤ k.
def func_1(n, k, M, t):
    total_time_per_task = sum(t)
    max_points = 0
    for complete_tasks in range(n + 1):
        time_used = complete_tasks * total_time_per_task
        
        if time_used > M:
            break
        
        points = complete_tasks * (k + 1)
        
        remaining_time = M - time_used
        
        subtasks_solved = 0
        
        for subtask_time in t:
            if remaining_time >= subtask_time:
                max_subtasks_for_this_task = remaining_time // subtask_time
                subtasks_solved += max_subtasks_for_this_task
                remaining_time -= max_subtasks_for_this_task * subtask_time
        
        subtasks_solved = min(subtasks_solved, (n - complete_tasks) * k)
        
        max_points = max(max_points, points + subtasks_solved)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `complete_tasks` is between 0 and `n` (inclusive), `max_points` is the maximum of `points + subtasks_solved` for all iterations, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of the total number of subtasks that can be solved with the available time and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, and `remaining_time` is 0 if `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` is less than or equal to the sum of all `subtask_time` in `t`, otherwise it is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - subtasks_solved * subtask_time`. If the loop does not execute, `complete_tasks` is 0, `max_points` is 0, `points` is 0, `subtasks_solved` is 0, and `remaining_time` is `M`.
    return max_points
    #The program returns max_points which is the maximum of points + subtasks_solved for all iterations. Here, points is the product of complete_tasks and (k + 1), and subtasks_solved is the minimum of the total number of subtasks that can be solved with the available time and (n - complete_tasks) * k. The available time is determined by the remaining time M and the time required to complete tasks, which depends on total_time_per_task and the number of complete_tasks.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the maximum points achievable by completing tasks and solving subtasks within a given time constraint, considering various combinations of task completion and subtask solving, and returns this maximum value, handling potential edge cases such as minimal input values and invalid input parameters.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
