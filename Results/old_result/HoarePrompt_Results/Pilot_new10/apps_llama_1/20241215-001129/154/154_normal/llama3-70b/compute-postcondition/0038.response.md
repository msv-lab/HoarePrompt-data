The given code updates the value of `dp[i][j]` by taking the maximum between its current value and `dp[i - 1][j - t[i - 1]] + 1`. 

Given that `i` is 3, `j` is 1, `t[2]` is the time required to solve the subtask at index `i - 1` (which is `t[2]`), and `j` is greater than or equal to `t[2]`, we know that the subtask at index `i - 1` can be completed within `j` minutes.

The value of `dp[3][1]` becomes the maximum of its current value (which is equal to `dp[3][0]`) and `dp[2][1 - t[2]] + 1`. 

Since `dp[3][1]` and `dp[3][0]` are equal initially and `dp[2][1 - t[2]] + 1` cannot be less than `dp[3][0]` (because we are taking the maximum), `dp[3][1]` is updated to `dp[2][1 - t[2]] + 1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 2, `M` is an input integer (1 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[3][1]` is equal to `dp[2][1 - t[2]] + 1`, `i` is 3, `j` is 1 and `j` is greater than or equal to the time required to solve the subtask at index `i - 1` in `t`, which is `t[2]`.**
