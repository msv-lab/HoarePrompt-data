To determine the output state, we'll examine the given code and initial state. The code snippet provided is:

```python
subtasks_solved = 0
```

This line introduces a new variable, `subtasks_solved`, and assigns it the value `0`. 

The initial state provides information about several variables:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `M` is a non-negative integer.
- `t` is a list of `k` positive integers.
- `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`.
- `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`.
- `max_points` is 0.
- `complete_tasks` is 0.
- `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, with the condition that if `time_used` is higher than `M`, the loop or if statement is terminated.

Given this initial state and the code, we can observe that the introduction of `subtasks_solved` and its assignment to `0` does not affect the values of the existing variables. The states of `n`, `k`, `M`, `t`, `total_time_per_task`, `points`, `max_points`, `complete_tasks`, and `remaining_time` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state, considering the introduction of the new variable `subtasks_solved` and the unchanged state of the other variables, is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is 0, `complete_tasks` is 0, `remaining_time` is `M - time_used`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, and if `time_used` is higher than `M`, the loop or if statement is terminated, otherwise, the program continues**
