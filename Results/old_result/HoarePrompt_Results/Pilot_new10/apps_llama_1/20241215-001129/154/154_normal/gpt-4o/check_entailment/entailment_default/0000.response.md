Correctness: **False**

The code is incorrect because it does not correctly calculate the maximum points achievable by solving subtasks within a given time constraint. The issue lies in the way it calculates the number of subtasks that can be solved within the remaining time. 

In the given code, it tries to solve as many subtasks as possible with the remaining time, but it does not consider the optimal way to solve these subtasks. It simply divides the remaining time by the time required for each subtask and adds up the results. This approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the fact that the subtasks can be solved in any order, and that solving the subtasks with the shortest time requirement first would maximize the number of points earned.

For example, consider a scenario where n = 2, k = 3, M = 6, and t = [1, 2, 3]. The code will first calculate the total time per task, which is 1 + 2 + 3 = 6. Then, it will try to complete as many tasks as possible within the given time, which is 1 task in this case. The remaining time is 0, so it will not be able to solve any additional subtasks.

However, the optimal solution would be to solve the subtasks with the shortest time requirement first. In this case, we can solve the first subtask of both tasks (2 * 1 = 2 minutes), and then solve the second subtask of one task (1 * 2 = 2 minutes). This leaves us with 2 minutes remaining, which is not enough to solve the third subtask of either task, but we can earn 4 points for solving these subtasks. The code does not consider this optimal solution and will only earn 4 points for completing one task.

This is just one example of how the code can fail to find the optimal solution. The code needs to be modified to consider all possible combinations of solving subtasks and tasks to find the optimal solution.
