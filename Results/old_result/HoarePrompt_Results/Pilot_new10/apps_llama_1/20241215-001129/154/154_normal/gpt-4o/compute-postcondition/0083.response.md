The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `k`, `M`, and `t`. `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, and `t` is a list of `k` positive integers. After executing the function body, the function returns `max_points`, which is the maximum of points plus subtasks solved for all iterations, where points is calculated based on complete tasks and subtasks solved is determined by available time and the number of incomplete tasks. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept positive integers `n` and `k`, a non-negative integer `M`, and a list of positive integers `t`, and return the maximum points that can be achieved based on task completion and subtask solving within the given time constraint.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, k, M, and t, and returns the maximum points achievable based on task completion and subtask solving within the given time constraint.**
