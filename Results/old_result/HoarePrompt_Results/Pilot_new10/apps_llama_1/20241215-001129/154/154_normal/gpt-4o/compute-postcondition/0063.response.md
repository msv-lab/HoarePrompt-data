Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers that must have at least 1 element, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points`, `complete_tasks` is at least 1, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is 0, `subtask_time` is the first element of `t`, and the current value of `remaining_time` is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` and is greater than or equal to `subtask_time`**
