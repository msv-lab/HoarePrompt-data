The code updates the value of `subtasks_solved`. The new value of `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The previous value of `subtasks_solved` is the total number of subtasks that can be solved with the available time `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, and `complete_tasks` is at least 1. 

The value of `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points`, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is now the minimum of its previous value and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `remaining_time` is 0 if `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` is less than or equal to the sum of all `subtask_time` in `t`, otherwise it is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - subtasks_solved * subtask_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `M` is a non-negative integer, `t` is a list of `k` positive integers, `total_time_per_task` is the sum of all elements in `t`, `points` is `complete_tasks * (k + 1)`, `max_points` is the maximum of its previous value and `points`, `complete_tasks` is at least 1, `time_used` is `complete_tasks * total_time_per_task`, `subtasks_solved` is the minimum of the total number of subtasks that can be solved with the available time `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` and `(n - complete_tasks) * k`, `remaining_time` is 0 if `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task` is less than or equal to the sum of all `subtask_time` in `t`, otherwise it is `M - complete_tasks * total_time_per_task - subtasks_solved * subtask_time`.**
