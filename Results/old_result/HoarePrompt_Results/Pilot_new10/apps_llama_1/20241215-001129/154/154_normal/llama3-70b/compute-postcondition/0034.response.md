According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 3, and `k` must be greater than 2 for the loop to continue.
State: **`n` is an input integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 45), `k` is an input integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 45) and must be greater than 2, `M` is an input integer (0 ≤ M ≤ 2*10^9), `t` is a sorted list of `k` integers representing the time in minutes required to solve each subtask in ascending order, `dp` is a `(k + 1) x (M + 1)` 2D list where `dp[3][j]` is the maximum number of subtasks that can be solved within `j` minutes considering the first 3 subtasks, `i` is 3**
