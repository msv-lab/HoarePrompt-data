Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly solve the problem. 

One issue with the program is that it tries to solve the problem by calculating the maximum number of subtasks that can be completed within the given time limit for a single task. However, the problem allows Polycarp to solve subtasks in any order and from any task. 

The program does not consider the optimal strategy of solving the subtasks with the smallest time requirements first, regardless of the task they belong to. 

For example, if we have three tasks with subtasks (1, 2, 3), (1, 4, 5), and (1, 6, 7), and a time limit of 10, the program will not correctly calculate the maximum number of points that can be earned.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to calculate the total time required to solve all subtasks in each task, then use dynamic programming to find the optimal combination of tasks and subtasks that can be completed within the given time limit.

Here's an example of how the program can be corrected:

```python
def func():
    (n, k, M) = map(int, input().split())
    t = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (k + 1)
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        prefix_sum[i] = prefix_sum[i - 1] + t[i - 1]
    dp = [0] * (M + 1)
    for i in range(1, n + 1):
        for j in range(M, -1, -1):
            for l in range(1, k + 1):
                if j >= prefix_sum[l]:
                    dp[j] = max(dp[j], dp[j - prefix_sum[l]] + l + (1 if l == k else 0))
    print(dp[M])
```
