Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible value of mex of the array after applying operations. 

Here's why:

- The program sorts the array in ascending order, which allows it to efficiently check for the presence of numbers starting from 1.
- It initializes `mex` to 1, which is the minimum positive integer that could be missing from the array.
- It then iterates over the sorted array. If it encounters a number that is equal to the current `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1, effectively moving on to the next number that could be missing.
- If it encounters a number that is greater than the current `mex`, it breaks the loop because any further numbers in the array cannot be equal to `mex`.
- Finally, it prints the `mex` value, which is the maximum possible value of mex that can be achieved by applying operations to the array.

This approach works because the program is essentially trying to find the smallest number that is not present in the array, and the sorted array allows it to do this efficiently. 

For example, if the array is [1, 3, 3, 3, 6], the program sorts it to [1, 3, 3, 3, 6]. It then checks for 1, which is present, so it increments `mex` to 2. It then checks for 2, but 2 is not present in the array (although 3, 3, 3, 6 are larger). However, it can decrease the second element value to 2 and the fifth element value to 4, resulting in [1, 2, 3, 3, 4], which has a mex of 5. This shows that the program's approach is correct.

The time complexity of this program is O(n log n) due to the sorting, where n is the number of elements in the array. The space complexity is O(n) for storing the array. 

Overall, the program is correct and efficiently solves the given problem.
