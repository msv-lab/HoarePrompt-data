Correctness: **False**

The given code does not fully implement the problem description. The code simply sorts the array and finds the smallest positive integer that is not present in the array, which is not the correct approach to find the maximum possible value of mex.

The code does not consider the option of decreasing elements in the array to increase the mex value. For example, in the input case where n = 5 and the array is [1, 3, 3, 3, 6], the code will output 2, but the correct output is 5, which can be achieved by decreasing the second element to 2 and the fifth element to 4, resulting in the array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4].

To achieve the maximum possible value of mex, we need to modify the code to consider decreasing elements in the array. One possible approach is to count the number of occurrences of each number from 1 to n and then find the maximum number that can be achieved by decreasing elements. 

The code should be modified to handle this case correctly. 

Here is a possible correct implementation:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    arr.sort()

    used = [False] * n
    mex = 1
    for num in arr:
        while num >= mex:
            if num == mex and not any(x == mex for x in arr):
                break
            if mex <= n and not any(x == mex and not used[i] for i, x in enumerate(arr)):
                used[arr.index(mex)] = True
                mex += 1
            else:
                break

    print(mex)
```
This modified code first checks if a number is present in the array, and if it is not, it tries to use the smallest available number to fill the gap. This way, it can achieve the maximum possible value of mex by decreasing elements in the array. 

However, even this modified code might not be correct for all cases, and a more efficient and correct solution would be to use a different approach, such as using a set to keep track of the numbers that are present in the array and then finding the smallest positive integer that is not in the set. 

The correct implementation would be:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    arr = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set(arr)
    mex = 1
    while mex in s:
        mex += 1
    print(min(mex, n + 1))
```
