The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters, but it implicitly takes two lines of input: the first line contains a single integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000), and the second line contains `n` integers `a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}` (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9). 

To describe the return value, we are missing the output cases of the function, so for the sake of the example, let's assume there are two return cases: 
Case_1: If all numbers in the list are equal, the function returns "All numbers are equal".
Case_2: If not all numbers in the list are equal, the function returns the maximum number in the list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept two lines of input (an integer `n` and `n` integers) and return either a message indicating all numbers are equal if they are, or the maximum number in the list if they are not.
