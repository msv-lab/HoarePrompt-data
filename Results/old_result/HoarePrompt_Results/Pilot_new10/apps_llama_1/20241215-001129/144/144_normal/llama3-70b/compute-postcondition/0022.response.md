To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code iterates over the sorted list `arr` and checks if the current number `num` is equal to the current `mex` (minimum excluded value). If `num` is equal to `mex`, it increments `mex` by 1. If `num` is greater than `mex`, it breaks out of the loop.

From the output states, we can observe the following patterns:

* `mex` is incremented by 1 whenever `num` is equal to `mex`.
* The loop breaks out of the loop when `num` is greater than `mex`.
* If the loop executes at least `k` times, `arr` must have at least `k` elements.

Let's think about what happens after all iterations of the loop have finished:

* If the loop executes `n` times, where `n` is the length of `arr`, it means that all elements in `arr` are equal to their corresponding `mex` values. In this case, `mex` will be equal to `n + 1`.
* If the loop breaks out of the loop when `num` is greater than `mex`, it means that there is a "gap" in the sequence of numbers in `arr`. In this case, `mex` will be equal to the smallest number that is not present in `arr`.
* If the loop does not execute at all (i.e., `arr` is an empty list), `mex` will remain 1.

Based on these observations, we can conclude that:

* `mex` will be equal to the smallest number that is not present in `arr`, or `n + 1` if all numbers from 1 to `n` are present in `arr`.
* `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers in ascending order, where `n` is the original length of `arr`.
* `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of `n` integers in ascending order where for each integer `a_i`, 1 ≤ `a_i` ≤ 10^9, and `mex` is the smallest number that is not present in `arr`.**
