The code `arr.sort()` sorts the list `arr` in ascending order. The initial state specifies that `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, and `arr` is a list of n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9. 

The sorting operation does not change the value of `n`, but it does rearrange the elements of `arr` so that they are in ascending order. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9**
