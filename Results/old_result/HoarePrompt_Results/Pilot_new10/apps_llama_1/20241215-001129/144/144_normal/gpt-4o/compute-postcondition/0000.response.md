The code takes an input and converts it to an integer, assigning it to the variable `n`. The input is implied to be a single integer on the first line. 

The value of `n` is now an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000. The second line of input which contains n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} is not yet read.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, the second line of input is pending and contains n integers a_1, a_2,..., a_{n} (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 10^9)**
