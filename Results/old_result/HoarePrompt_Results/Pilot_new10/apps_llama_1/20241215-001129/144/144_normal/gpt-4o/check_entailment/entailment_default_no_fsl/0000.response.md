Correctness: **True**

The provided Python code correctly implements the required functionality to determine the maximum possible value of mex of the array after applying some operations. 

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:
- It first reads the input and sorts the array, which ensures that the numbers are processed in ascending order.
- It then initializes the mex variable to 1, which represents the smallest positive integer that doesn't appear in the array.
- The code iterates through the sorted array. If it encounters a number that is greater than or equal to the current mex, it increments the mex by 1. This effectively means that the code is checking if the current mex is present in the array. If it's not, the mex remains the same.
- The code correctly handles edge cases, including empty lists (which aren't applicable in this problem since the input size is at least 1), lists with single or duplicate elements, and lists containing large numbers.
- The provided examples also demonstrate that the code works as expected. In the first example, the output is 5, which is correct because the mex of the array [1, 2, 3, 3, 4] is indeed 5. In the second example, the output is 3, which is correct because the mex of the array [1, 2] is indeed 3.

Overall, the code seems to correctly implement the required functionality, and there are no apparent cases where it does not work as expected according to the problem description.
