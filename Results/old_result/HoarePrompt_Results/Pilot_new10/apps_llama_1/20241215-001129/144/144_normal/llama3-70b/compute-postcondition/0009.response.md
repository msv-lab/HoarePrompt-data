The code provided is a `break` statement. The `break` statement in Python is used to terminate the loop or switch statement. When a `break` statement is encountered, the loop or switch statement is immediately terminated, and the control is passed to the statement that follows the loop or switch statement.

In this case, since the `break` statement is executed, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. However, the values of the variables `n`, `arr`, `mex`, and `num` do not change.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and arr has at least 1 element, `mex` is 1, `num` is the first element in `arr` and is not equal to `mex`, and `num` is greater than `mex`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
