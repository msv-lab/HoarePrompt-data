The code `a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The value of `n` remains unchanged, as it is the number of elements in the list `a`. The list `a` is modified, as its elements are rearranged in ascending order.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers from the input, where each integer is between 1 and 10^9, in ascending order**.
