The function accepts two lines of input: an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers, sorts the list, and then calculates the smallest positive integer not present in the sorted list, printing this value as the result, handling various edge cases including empty lists, lists with single or duplicate elements, and lists containing zeros or negative numbers.
