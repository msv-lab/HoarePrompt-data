The value of `mex` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `mex` was 1, so the new value of `mex` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `arr` is a sorted list of n integers in ascending order where for each integer a_i, 1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9 and arr has at least 1 element, `mex` is 2, `num` is 1**
