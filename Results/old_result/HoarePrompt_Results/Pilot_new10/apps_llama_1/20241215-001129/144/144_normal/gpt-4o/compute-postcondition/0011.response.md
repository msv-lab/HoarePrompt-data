According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If the list has at least 3 elements, the loop can execute again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, `a` has at least 2 elements, `num` is the second element in the list `a`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `a` must have at least 3 elements and `num` is the third element in the list `a`. 
State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100,000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers that must have at least 3 elements, `num` is the third element in the list `a`**
