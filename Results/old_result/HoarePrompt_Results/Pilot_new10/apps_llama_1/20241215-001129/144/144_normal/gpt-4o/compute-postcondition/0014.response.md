To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code iterates over each number `num` in the sorted list `a`. If `num` is greater than or equal to the current `mex` (minimum excluded value), `mex` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `mex` is 1.

From the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can observe the following patterns:
- `n` remains the same as it is the input integer representing the number of elements in `a`.
- `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and the loop executes over each element in `a`.
- `num` takes the value of the current element in `a` being processed.
- `mex` starts at 1 and increments whenever `num` is greater than or equal to the current `mex`.

The key to understanding the final output state is recognizing what `mex` represents. `mex` is the smallest positive integer that is not present in the list `a` or is greater than all elements in `a` if all smaller positive integers are present. Given that the loop increments `mex` whenever it encounters a number in `a` that is greater than or equal to the current `mex`, the final value of `mex` will be the smallest positive integer that is not in `a` plus one, or it will be one more than the maximum value in `a` if all integers from 1 to the maximum value in `a` are present in `a`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished:
- `n` will remain the same.
- `a` will remain the same as it is not modified within the loop.
- `num` will have taken the value of the last element in `a`, but its final value is not as significant for understanding the output state as the value of `mex`.
- `mex` will be the minimum excluded value plus one, which means it will be the smallest positive integer not present in `a` plus one, or the maximum value in `a` plus one if `a` contains all positive integers up to its maximum value.

Considering the loop does not execute if `a` is empty, but given `n` is between 1 and 100,000, `a` is guaranteed to have at least one element. Thus, the loop will always execute at least once.

Given the patterns and the purpose of the loop, the final output state can be described as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100,000, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers between 1 and 10^9, `mex` is the smallest positive integer not present in `a` plus one, and `num` is the last element in `a`.**
