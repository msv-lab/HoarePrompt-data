Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue with the program is that it does not correctly determine the maximum possible value of mex.

The problem statement allows Alyona to decrease any element in the array to a smaller positive integer. The program, however, simply sorts the array and then increments the mex value whenever it encounters an element that is greater than or equal to the current mex value. This approach is incorrect because it does not take into account the possibility of decreasing elements to smaller values.

For example, consider the input array [2, 2, 2]. The program will output 1, because it encounters the first element 2 and increments the mex value to 2, and then it encounters the next two elements 2, but it cannot increment the mex value further. However, the correct output should be 3, because Alyona can decrease the three elements to 1, 2, and 3, respectively, achieving a mex value of 4, but since the smallest number is 2 the mex is 3.

In this case, the program fails to consider the possibility of decreasing the elements to smaller values, resulting in an incorrect output. 

The correct approach to solve this problem would be to use a set to keep track of the unique elements in the array and then find the smallest positive integer that is not in the set. The program can then try to decrease elements to smaller values to increase the mex value.

Here is the correct code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    s = set(a)
    mex = 1
    while mex in s:
        mex += 1
    print(mex)
```
However the problem description does allow Alyona to decrease the element to any value smaller than the current value and the problem is to find the maximum possible value of mex of this array. 
A better way to solve this problem is to consider the frequency of each number in the array and try to fill the gaps (i.e., the missing numbers) by decreasing the frequency of larger numbers.
Here is the correct code:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    freq = {}
    for num in a:
        if num not in freq:
            freq[num] = 0
        freq[num] += 1
    mex = 1
    gap = 0
    for i in range(1, 1000000):
        if i not in freq:
            gap += 1
        elif freq[i] > gap:
            freq[i] -= gap
            gap = 0
        else:
            gap -= freq[i]
    print(mex + max(gap, 0))
```
