The function `func` does not accept any parameters. 

However, the problem statement does provide a parameter constraint, but it does not match the given function definition `def func():` which does not accept any parameters. 

Assuming the correct function definition should be `def func(input_string):`, where `input_string` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.

Since the output is not provided in the problem statement, we cannot determine the return value of the function.

If we were to provide a description based on the given constraints and assuming a corrected function definition with an output, the description would be:

The function `func` accepts a parameter `input_string`. `input_string` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters. 

However, without the output, we cannot provide a complete functionality description.


Given the lack of information about the output, a complete answer in the requested format is not possible. If more details were provided about what the function returns based on the input string, a more accurate description could be given. 

For example, if the output were given, the answer might look something like this:

Functionality: **The function accepts a string parameter, returns a value based on the input string.** 

Without the actual output details, this is the closest we can get to the requested format.
