Correctness: **True**.

The provided code accurately follows the problem description. It iterates over all possible substrings of the input string `s` and checks if each substring is a palindrome by comparing it to its reverse (`substr[::-1]`). If a substring is not a palindrome, its length is compared to the current `max_len`, and `max_len` is updated if the substring's length is greater.

The code handles all potential cases, including:

1.  **Empty string:** Although the problem description guarantees a non-empty string, the code will still work correctly for an empty string, returning 0 as expected.
2.  **Single-character string:** The code will correctly identify a single-character string as a palindrome and return 0.
3.  **Palindromic strings:** If all substrings of the input string are palindromes, the code will correctly return 0.
4.  **Non-palindromic strings:** If there exists at least one non-palindromic substring, the code will correctly return the length of the longest such substring.

The output hints agree with the code, indicating that it finds the length of the longest non-palindrome substring and prints it, or prints 0 if all substrings are palindromes. The provided examples also demonstrate the code's correctness:

*   **"mew"**: The code correctly returns 3, as "mew" is not a palindrome.
*   **"wuffuw"**: The code correctly returns 5, as "uffuw" is one of the longest non-palindrome substrings.
*   **"qqqqqqqq"**: The code correctly returns 0, as all substrings of "qqqqqqqq" are palindromes.

In conclusion, the code accurately implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
