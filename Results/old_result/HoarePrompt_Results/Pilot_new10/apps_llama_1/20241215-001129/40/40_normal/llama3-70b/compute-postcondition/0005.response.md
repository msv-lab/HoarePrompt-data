The code `substr = s[i:j]` creates a new substring `substr` from the string `s`, starting at index `i` and ending at index `j`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 1, so `substr` will be a substring of length 1, containing the first character of `s`.

Since `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, and `n` is the length of `s` which must be greater than 0, the substring `substr` will be a single lowercase English letter.

The values of `n`, `max_len`, `i`, and `j` are not changed by this code. The variable `substr` is newly introduced and is equal to the first character of `s`, which is `s[0]`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `substr` is equal to `s[0]`.**
