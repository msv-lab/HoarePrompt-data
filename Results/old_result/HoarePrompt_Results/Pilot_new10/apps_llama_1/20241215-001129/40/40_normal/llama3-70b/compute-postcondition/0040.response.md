The value of `substr` is assigned the substring of `s` starting from index `i` to `j`. Given that `j` is `i + 2`, `substr` will be a substring of length 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `substr` is a substring of `s` of length 2 starting from index `i`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`, and `substr` is `s[i:i+2]`.**
