The code updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of the current `substr`. Since `substr` is not a palindrome, its length is a valid candidate for `max_len`. 

Given that `substr` is `s[i]`, its length is 1. The value of `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 1. If `max_len` was 0, it becomes 1. If `max_len` was greater than 0, it remains unchanged because 1 is less than or equal to any previous length of a non-palindromic substring.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is less than `n`, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 1, `j` is `i + 1`, and `substr` is `s[i]` and is not a palindrome.**
