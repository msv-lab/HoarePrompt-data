According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `n`. If `j` is less than `n + 1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is `i + 2`. Since `n` is greater than `i` and `j` is `i + 2`, `n` must be greater than `i + 1` for the loop to execute again. Also, since `j` is `i + 2`, the substring from index `i` to `j` will be longer than the previous substring, so `max_len` may be updated again. The string `s` remains the same.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 2`**
