To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0.
- `i` is 0.
- `j` is 2.
- `substr` is `s[0:2]`.

The code provided is:
```python
max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```

However, we need to note that `max_len` is not defined in the initial state. Thus, we can't directly calculate its value without knowing its previous state. For the purpose of this explanation, let's consider `max_len` as a variable that has been initialized before this line of code is executed, but its initial value is unknown.

The impact of the code:
- `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is `s[0:2]`, its length is 2 (given that `s` is at least 2 characters long because `n` is the length of `s` and `n > 0`, and we have a `substr` of length 2).

Given that `substr` is always of length 2 because it's defined as `s[0:2]`, and assuming `max_len` was initialized before this point (though its exact initial value is not specified), `max_len` will be set to 2 if its current value is less than 2. If `max_len` is already greater than or equal to 2, its value remains unchanged.

Therefore, considering all variables and their states:
- `s` remains a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` remains the length of `s` and is greater than 0.
- `i` remains 0.
- `j` remains 2.
- `substr` remains `s[0:2]`.
- `max_len` is either its previous value if that value is greater than or equal to 2, or it becomes 2.

Given that we don't know the initial value of `max_len`, we can say that after the execution of the given code, `max_len` will be at least 2 if `substr` (which is of length 2) is considered in the comparison.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `substr` is `s[0:2]`, and `max_len` is at least 2.**
