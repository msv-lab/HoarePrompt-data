To solve this problem, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step:

1. The initial state provides the following information:
   - `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
   - `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 2`.
   - `i` is less than `n`.
   - `j` is `i + 3`.
   - `substr` is `s[i:i+3]`.

2. The code snippet is:
   ```
   max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
   ```
   This line updates the value of `max_len` to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`.

3. Given that `substr` is `s[i:i+3]`, its length will always be 3 because it is a slice of 3 characters from `s`. This is possible because `n` is greater than `i + 2`, ensuring that there are at least 3 characters starting from index `i` in `s`.

4. Therefore, `len(substr)` will always be 3.

5. The `max_len` variable is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 3.

6. Since `max_len` is being compared with a fixed value (the length of `substr`, which is 3), if `max_len` is less than 3, it will become 3 after this operation. If `max_len` is already 3 or greater, its value will remain unchanged.

7. The other variables (`s`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `substr`) do not change their values as a result of this operation.

Considering these points, the output state will reflect the update to `max_len` but keep all other variables unchanged:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 3`, `substr` is `s[i:i+3]`, `max_len` is the maximum of its previous value and 3**
