Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it works:

1. The program first checks if the length of the input string `s` is less than or equal to 1. If it is, the program prints 0, which is correct because a single-character string or an empty string is always a palindrome, and therefore there is no non-palindrome substring.

2. The program then defines a helper function `func_1(s)` that checks if a string `s` is a palindrome by comparing it with its reverse (`s[::-1]`).

3. The program checks if the input string `s` is not a palindrome using the `func_1(s)` function. If it's not a palindrome, the program prints the length of `s`, which is correct because the longest non-palindrome substring of a non-palindrome string is the string itself.

4. If the input string `s` is a palindrome, the program then checks if the substring `s[1:]` (i.e., `s` without the first character) is not a palindrome. If it's not a palindrome, the program prints the length of `s` minus 1, which is correct because the longest non-palindrome substring of a palindrome string is often the substring without the first or last character.

5. The program also checks if the substring `s[:-1]` (i.e., `s` without the last character) is not a palindrome. If it's not a palindrome, the program prints the length of `s` minus 1, which is correct for the same reason as in step 4.

6. If none of the above conditions are met, it means that all substrings of `s` are palindromes, so the program prints 0, which is correct according to the problem description.

The program handles all possible cases and correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Therefore, its correctness is **True**.
