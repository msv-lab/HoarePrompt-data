The value of `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the length of `substr`. Since `substr` is `s[i:i+3]`, its length is 3. Therefore, `max_len` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and 3.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`, `substr` is `s[i:i+3]`, and `max_len` is at least 3**
