To calculate the result, we first note that `max_len` is initially 0 and `substr` is a single character string `s[0]`. Since `substr` is a single character, its length is 1. 

Given that `max_len` is 0 and the length of `substr` is 1, `max_len` will be updated to 1 because 1 is greater than 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `max_len` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `substr` is equal to `s[0]`, and the current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `max_len` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `substr` is equal to `s[0]`, and the current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse.**
