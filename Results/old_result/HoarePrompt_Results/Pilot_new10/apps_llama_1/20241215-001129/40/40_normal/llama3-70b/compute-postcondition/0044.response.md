To calculate the output state, let's consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Given:
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 2`.
- `i` is less than `n`.
- `j` is `i + 3`.
- The initial value of `substr` isn't directly calculable without assuming the loop body's logic, but we are interested in its new value based on the given code.

Code:
```python
substr = s[i:j]
```

This code assigns to `substr` a slice of string `s`, starting from index `i` up to but not including index `j`.

Given that `j` is `i + 3`, this means `substr` will be a substring of `s` with a length of 3, starting from the `i-th` index.

The impact on the program's state:
- The value of `substr` is now a 3-character substring of `s`, starting from the `i-th` character.
- The values of `s`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged as the code snippet only reads from these variables and does not modify them.

Therefore, the output state, considering all the information from the precondition that is still valid after the code has been executed, is:
- `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
- `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 2`.
- `i` is less than `n`.
- `j` is `i + 3`.
- `substr` is a 3-character substring of `s`, starting from the `i-th` character.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 3`, `substr` is `s[i:i+3]`.**
