According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is the length of `s`, and `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, we know that `n` must be greater than 0 and less than or equal to 50. Before the loop starts, `i` is not defined, so it needs to be adjusted to be 0, which is the starting index of the range.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and must be greater than 0, `max_len` is 0, `i` is 0**
