Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, or 0 if all substrings of `s` are palindromes, `substr` is the character at index `i` in `s`. The current value of `substr` is not equal to its reverse.**
