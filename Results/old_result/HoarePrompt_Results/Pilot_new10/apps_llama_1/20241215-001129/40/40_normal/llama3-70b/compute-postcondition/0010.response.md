The code `substr = s[i:j]` assigns the substring of `s` from index `i` to `j` to the variable `substr`. Given the initial state, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. 

`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2. 

`s[0:2]` would be a string of length 2 since `i` is 0 and `j` is 2, so `substr` would be a string of length 2.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `substr` is `s[0:2]`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `substr` is `s[0:2]`.**
