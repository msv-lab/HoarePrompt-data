To determine the output state of the loop, we need to analyze the loop code and the provided output states after a few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for i in range(n):
    for j in range(i + 1, n + 1):
        substr = s[i:j]
        if substr!= substr[::-1]:
            max_len = max(max_len, len(substr))
```
The loop iterates over all possible substrings of `s` and checks if they are palindromes. If a substring is not a palindrome, it updates `max_len` with the maximum length of such substrings.

From the provided output states, we can see that:

* `s` remains unchanged throughout the loop.
* `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0.
* `i` is less than or equal to `n` and is updated in each iteration of the outer loop.
* `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, or 0 if all substrings of `s` are palindromes.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, we can conclude that:

* `s` is still a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters.
* `n` is still the length of `s` and is greater than 0.
* `i` is equal to `n`, since the outer loop iterates `n` times.
* `max_len` is the length of the longest substring of `s` that is not a palindrome, or 0 if all substrings of `s` are palindromes.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is equal to `n`, and `max_len` is the length of the longest non-palindrome substring of `s`, or 0 if all substrings of `s` are palindromes.**
