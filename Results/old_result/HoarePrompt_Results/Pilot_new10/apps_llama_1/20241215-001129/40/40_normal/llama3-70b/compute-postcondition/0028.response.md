According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is `i + 3`. Also, since the loop iterates until `j` is less than `n + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `i + 3`. The value of `i` is also increased by 1 for the next iteration of the outer loop (not shown), but here it needs to be considered in relation to `n` for the given loop to continue, thus `i` is less than `n - 2` to allow `j` to increment. Since `j` is `i + 3` now, `substr` will be `s[i:i+2]` but since `i` is incremented implicitly in the next iteration of the outer loop (which is not shown here), `substr` will be `s[i+1:i+3]`. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of length at most 50 characters, containing only lowercase English letters, `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than `i + 2`, `i` is less than `n - 2`, `j` is `i + 3`, and `substr` is `s[i+1:i+3]`. If `substr` is not equal to its reverse, then `max_len` is at least 2, specifically `max_len` equals `max(previous max_len, 2)`**
