Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly determine the longest substring that is not a palindrome. The current implementation only checks if the entire string or its prefixes/suffixes are palindromes, but it does not check all possible substrings.

A case where the program does not work correctly is when the string has a non-palindromic substring that is not a prefix or suffix of the string. For example, if the input string is "abccba", the longest non-palindromic substring is "bcc", but the program will incorrectly return 0 because the entire string is a palindrome.

To fix this, the program should check all possible substrings, not just the entire string and its prefixes/suffixes. The program should also keep track of the length of the longest non-palindromic substring found so far. 

Here is an example of a correct implementation:
```python
s = input().strip()
max_length = 0

for i in range(len(s)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
        substring = s[i:j]
        if substring!= substring[::-1]:
            max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))

print(max_length)
```
