Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. For example, consider the input string "abaa". The longest substring that is not a palindrome is "aba", which has a length of 3. However, the program will return 0, because it only checks if the entire string or the entire string minus the first or last character is a palindrome. 

In the given code, the function `func_1(s)` checks if a string `s` is equal to its reverse (`s[::-1]`), which is a correct way to check if a string is a palindrome. However, the main logic of the program does not correctly implement the problem description. It does not check all possible substrings of the input string to find the longest one that is not a palindrome.

To correctly solve this problem, the program should iterate over all possible substrings of the input string, check if each one is a palindrome, and keep track of the longest one that is not a palindrome. 

Here's an example of how the correct code could look:

```python
def func_1(s):
    return s == s[::-1]

s = input().strip()
max_length = 0
for i in range(len(s)):
    for j in range(i + 1, len(s) + 1):
        substring = s[i:j]
        if not func_1(substring):
            max_length = max(max_length, len(substring))

print(max_length)
```

This code correctly checks all possible substrings of the input string and finds the longest one that is not a palindrome.
