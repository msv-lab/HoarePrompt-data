Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly determines the outcome of Nauuo's comment based on the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes. The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. If `x > y + z`, it means that even if all unknown voters downvote, the number of upvotes will still be greater than the number of downvotes. In this case, the program correctly prints '+'.

2. If `x < y`, it means that there are already more downvotes than upvotes, and the unknown voters cannot change this outcome. In this case, the program correctly prints '-'.

3. If `x == y`, the outcome depends on the unknown voters. If `z == 0`, it means there are no unknown voters, and the outcome is a tie ('0'). If `z > 0`, the outcome is uncertain ('?').

4. In all other cases, the program prints '?' to indicate an uncertain outcome.

The program correctly handles all possible combinations of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, and produces the expected output for the provided examples. After analyzing the program and the problem statement, no cases were found where the program does not work as expected.
