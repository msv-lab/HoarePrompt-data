Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers, each less than or equal to 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. If `x` equals `y`, then if `z` is 0, a value `0` has been printed, otherwise a '?' has been printed. If `x` does not equal `y`, then a '?' has been printed.***
