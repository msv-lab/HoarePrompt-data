The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters. However, it is implied that there are three non-negative integers x, y, z where 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown. 

Since the output is not specified, I'll create a general description based on common possible outputs for such a function. 

Please provide the output to give a more accurate description.

Assuming possible outputs based on common upvote, downvote, and unknown vote counters:
Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters but implies the presence of three non-negative integers x, y, z representing upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, and returns a result based on these implied values, such as the total number of votes, the ratio of upvotes to downvotes, or a categorization based on the voting outcome.**
