Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers, each less than or equal to 100, representing the number of people who would upvote, downvote, and vote with unknown outcome, respectively. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, then '+' has been printed. If `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, then if `x` is less than `y`, a hyphen has been printed; otherwise, if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, a value `0` has been printed; otherwise, a '?' has been printed.***
