Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes three non-negative integers x, y, z as input from the user, representing upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes respectively. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes, which are x and x + z, and y and y + z, respectively. The code then compares these values to determine the outcome.

- If max_upvotes (x + z) is less than min_downvotes (y), it means that even if all unknown votes are upvotes, the downvotes will still win, so the code prints '-'.
- If max_downvotes (y + z) is less than min_upvotes (x), it means that even if all unknown votes are downvotes, the upvotes will still win, so the code prints '+'.
- If neither of the above conditions is met, it means that the outcome is uncertain, because there are scenarios where upvotes can win and scenarios where downvotes can win, depending on how the unknown votes are cast. In this case, the code prints '?'.

The code handles all possible cases correctly, including the examples provided in the problem description. For instance, when x = 3, y = 7, and z = 0, the code prints '-', which is correct because the downvotes are more than the upvotes. When x = 2, y = 0, and z = 1, the code prints '+', which is also correct because even if the unknown vote is a downvote, the upvotes will still win. When x = 1, y = 1, and z = 0, the code prints '0', which is correct because the upvotes and downvotes are equal. Finally, when x = 0, y = 0, and z = 1, the code prints '?', which is correct because the outcome is uncertain.

The output hints agree with the code, and the code handles all possible cases correctly. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
