The given Python code `print('?')` simply prints a question mark to the console. This operation does not modify the values of any variables.

Given the initial state:
- `x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers.
- Each of `x`, `y`, `z` is less than or equal to 100.
- `x` equals `y`.
- `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.
- `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`.
- `z` is greater than 0.

Since the code does not alter the values of `x`, `y`, or `z`, and given that `x` equals `y`, the conditions `x` is greater than or equal to `y` is always true because `x` equals `y`. Also, since `z` is greater than 0, the condition that `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z` remains valid without change.

Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the added fact that a question mark has been printed to the console.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers, each less than or equal to 100, `x` equals `y`, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `z` is greater than 0, and a '?' has been printed to the console.**
