The given code snippet is a print statement that prints the value '0'. This statement does not modify the values of any variables in the program.

Given the initial conditions:
- `x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers, each less than or equal to 100.
- `x` is equal to `y`.
- `x` is greater than or equal to `y`.
- `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`.
- The current value of `z` is 0.

Since `z` is 0, and `x` is less than or equal to the sum of `y` and `z`, and `x` equals `y`, the conditions `x` equals `y` and `x` is greater than or equal to `y` are satisfied. 

The print statement does not modify `x`, `y`, or `z`, so their values and relationships remain unchanged. 

The Output State is: `x` equals `y`, `x` and `y` are non-negative integers less than or equal to 100, `z` is 0, and a value `0` has been printed.

Output State: **`x` equals `y`, `x` and `y` are non-negative integers less than or equal to 100, `z` is 0, and a value `0` has been printed.**
