The code `x, y, z = map(int, input().split())` assigns the input values to the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the input consists of three non-negative integers, each less than or equal to 100, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` will be these input integers.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers, each less than or equal to 100, representing the number of people who would upvote, downvote, and vote with unknown outcome, respectively, and their values are set to the input integers**
