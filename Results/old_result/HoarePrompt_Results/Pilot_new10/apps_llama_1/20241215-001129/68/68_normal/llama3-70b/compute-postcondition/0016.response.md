Postcondition: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers, each less than or equal to 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. If `x` is less than `y`, a hyphen has been printed to the console. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, then if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, a value `0` has been printed; otherwise, a '?' has been printed.**
