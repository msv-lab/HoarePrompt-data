Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly in all cases. For example, if we have `cnt1 = 0`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 1`, and `cnt4 = 1`, the program will print `1` (because `cnt3` is not greater than `cnt1`), but it is actually impossible to form a regular bracket sequence with the strings ")(" and "))". 

When `cnt1 = 0`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 1`, and `cnt4 = 1`, the program should print `0`, because there is no possible way to arrange ")(" and "))" to form a regular bracket sequence. 

The condition `cnt3 > cnt1` does not cover all possible cases where it is impossible to form a regular bracket sequence. The program should also check for other conditions such as `cnt1 + cnt2 < cnt3 + cnt4`, which is a necessary condition to form a regular bracket sequence.

For example, a corrected version of the program could be:

```python
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt1 + cnt2 < cnt3 + cnt4 or cnt3 > cnt1 + cnt2:
        print(0)
    else:
        print(1)
```

This corrected version checks both conditions: `cnt1 + cnt2 >= cnt3 + cnt4` and `cnt3 <= cnt1 + cnt2`, ensuring that it is possible to form a regular bracket sequence with the given strings.
