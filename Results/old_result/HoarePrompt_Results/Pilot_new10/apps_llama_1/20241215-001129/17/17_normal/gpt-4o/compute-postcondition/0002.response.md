To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. The initial state provides information about four variables: `cnt1`, `cnt2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`. The code snippet provided assigns a new value to `cnt3` (which seems to be a typo and should likely refer to `cnt_3` to be consistent with the initial state description).

Given the initial state:
- `cnt1` is an input integer.
- `cnt2` is an input integer.
- `cnt_3` and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` <= 10^9.

The code snippet:
```python
cnt3 = int(input())
```
Assuming the typo and it should be `cnt_3` instead of `cnt3` for consistency, the corrected interpretation would be:
```python
cnt_3 = int(input())
```
This assigns a new integer value to `cnt_3` based on user input. The previous value of `cnt_3` and its constraints (0 <= `cnt_3` <= 10^9) are overridden by this new input value. However, the nature of `cnt_3` being an input integer now is clear.

The output state, considering the correction and understanding that `cnt3` should refer to `cnt_3`, is:
- `cnt1` remains an input integer.
- `cnt2` remains an input integer.
- `cnt_3` is now an input integer (the specifics of which are determined by the user's input at runtime).
- `cnt_4` remains a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `cnt_4` <= 10^9.

Thus, the output state reflects the update to `cnt_3` while maintaining the initial conditions for the other variables.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` is an input integer, `cnt_4` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `cnt_4` <= 10^9**
