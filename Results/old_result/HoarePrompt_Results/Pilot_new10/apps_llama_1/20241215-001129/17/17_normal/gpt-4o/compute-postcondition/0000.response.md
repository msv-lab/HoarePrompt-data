The given code is assigning an input integer value to `cnt1`. The initial state mentions four non-negative integers `cnt_1`, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4`, but the code only updates the value of `cnt1`. It seems there might be a slight inconsistency in the naming convention between the initial state and the code. However, following the code as given, `cnt1` will be assigned the value of an input integer.

Output State: **`cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `cnt_2`, `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` <= 10^9**
