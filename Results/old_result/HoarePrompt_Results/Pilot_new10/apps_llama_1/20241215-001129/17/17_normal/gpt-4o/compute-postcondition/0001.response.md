The value of `cnt2` is updated to be an input integer. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, and `cnt_3` and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` <= 10^9.
Output State: **`cnt1` is an input integer, `cnt2` is an input integer, `cnt_3` and `cnt_4` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `cnt_3`, `cnt_4` <= 10^9**
