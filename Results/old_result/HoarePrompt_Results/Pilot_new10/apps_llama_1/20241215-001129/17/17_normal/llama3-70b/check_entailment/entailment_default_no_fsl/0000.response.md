Correctness: **False**

The code checks if `cnt3` (the count of ")((") is greater than `cnt1` (the count of "(("), and if so, it prints 0. However, this is not a sufficient condition to determine whether a regular bracket sequence can be formed.

The problem statement requires that the total number of opening brackets should be equal to the total number of closing brackets for a regular bracket sequence. The code does not consider the counts of "()" and "))" brackets.

Consider the case where `cnt1 = 0`, `cnt2 = 0`, `cnt3 = 0`, and `cnt4 = 1`. In this case, the code will print 1, indicating that a regular bracket sequence can be formed. However, since there is only one closing bracket ")", it is not possible to form a regular bracket sequence.

To correctly solve the problem, we need to consider all the counts and ensure that the total number of opening brackets is equal to the total number of closing brackets. 

In this case, the condition for a regular bracket sequence to be possible is `cnt1 + cnt2 + cnt4 >= cnt3` and `cnt1 + cnt2 >= cnt3 + cnt4`. However, this is still not sufficient as the order of the brackets also matters. A correct approach would be to check if `cnt1 + cnt2` is greater than or equal to `cnt3 + cnt4` and also if `cnt1` is greater than or equal to `cnt3`. 

Here's a possible correction to the code:

```python
def func():
    (cnt1, cnt2, cnt3, cnt4) = map(int, [input() for _ in range(4)])
    if cnt1 + cnt2 >= cnt3 + cnt4 and cnt1 >= cnt3 and cnt2 + cnt1 >= cnt4:
        print(1)
    else:
        print(0)
```
