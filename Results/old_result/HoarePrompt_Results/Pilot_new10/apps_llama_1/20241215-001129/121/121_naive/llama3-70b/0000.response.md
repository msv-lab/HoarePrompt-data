Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly decodes the genome by replacing each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') to make the number of nucleotides of each type equal. 

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the code is correct:

1. It first counts the occurrences of each nucleotide in the string `s`, excluding unrecognized nucleotides represented by '?'.

2. It calculates the average count for each nucleotide by dividing the total length of the string `n` by 4. This gives the desired count for each nucleotide in the decoded genome.

3. It then calculates the remaining count for each nucleotide by subtracting the current count from the desired count.

4. When constructing the decoded genome, it replaces each unrecognized nucleotide '?' with the first nucleotide that has a remaining count greater than 0.

5. Finally, it checks if all remaining counts are 0. If they are, it prints the decoded genome. If not, it prints '===' to indicate that decoding is not possible.

The program correctly handles cases where decoding is possible and where it is not. It also correctly handles the replacement of unrecognized nucleotides with the desired nucleotides. 

I couldn't find any cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
