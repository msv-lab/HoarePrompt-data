Correctness: **True**

The given Python program appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description. It first checks if the length of the genome is divisible by 4, as it is a necessary condition for the number of nucleotides of each type to be equal. If the length is not divisible by 4, it immediately prints "===" and returns.

Next, it counts the occurrences of each nucleotide type ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the given string `s`. It then checks if any nucleotide type has a count greater than the target count (`n // 4`). If so, it prints "===" and returns, as it is impossible to balance the counts.

Finally, it iterates over the string `s` and replaces each unrecognized nucleotide ('?') with the first nucleotide type that has a count less than the target count. This approach ensures that the counts of all nucleotide types are balanced.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Genomes with lengths that are not divisible by 4
* Genomes with more occurrences of a nucleotide type than the target count
* Genomes with unrecognized nucleotides that can be replaced to balance the counts
* Genomes that are already decoded correctly

The program's logic and implementation are sound, and it should produce the correct output for all possible inputs. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
