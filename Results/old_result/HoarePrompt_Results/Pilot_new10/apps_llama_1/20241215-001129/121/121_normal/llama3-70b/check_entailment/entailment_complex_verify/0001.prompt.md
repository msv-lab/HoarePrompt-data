You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: The process of mammoth's genome decoding in Berland comes to its end!

One of the few remaining tasks is to restore unrecognized nucleotides in a found chain s. Each nucleotide is coded with a capital letter of English alphabet: 'A', 'C', 'G' or 'T'. Unrecognized nucleotides are coded by a question mark '?'. Thus, s is a string consisting of letters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and characters '?'.

It is known that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types in the decoded genome of mammoth in Berland should be equal.

Your task is to decode the genome and replace each unrecognized nucleotide with one of the four types so that the number of nucleotides of each of the four types becomes equal.


-----Input-----

The first line contains the integer n (4 ≤ n ≤ 255) — the length of the genome.

The second line contains the string s of length n — the coded genome. It consists of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and '?'.


-----Output-----

If it is possible to decode the genome, print it. If there are multiple answer, print any of them. If it is not possible, print three equals signs in a row: "===" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
8
AG?C??CT

Output
AGACGTCT

Input
4
AGCT

Output
AGCT

Input
6
????G?

Output
===

Input
4
AA??

Output
===



-----Note-----

In the first example you can replace the first question mark with the letter 'A', the second question mark with the letter 'G', the third question mark with the letter 'T', then each nucleotide in the genome would be presented twice.

In the second example the genome is already decoded correctly and each nucleotide is exactly once in it.

In the third and the fourth examples it is impossible to decode the genom.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
    if any(count.values()):
        print('===')
    else:
        print(res)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The given Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why:

1. The program first counts the occurrences of each nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the input string `s`. It ignores the unrecognized nucleotides '?'.

2. Then, it calculates the average frequency of each nucleotide, which should be equal in the decoded genome. It does this by dividing the length of the genome `n` by 4.

3. The program then adjusts the count of each nucleotide to the desired frequency by subtracting the current count from the average frequency. This gives the number of unrecognized nucleotides that need to be replaced with each type of nucleotide.

4. It then iterates over the input string `s` and replaces each unrecognized nucleotide '?' with a nucleotide that still needs to be added to reach the desired frequency.

5. Finally, it checks if all counts of nucleotides to be added are zero. If any count is not zero, it means that it's impossible to decode the genome with equal frequencies of nucleotides, so it prints "==="; otherwise, it prints the decoded genome.

The program correctly handles all edge cases, including:

* When the input string is already decoded and has equal frequencies of nucleotides.
* When it's impossible to decode the genome with equal frequencies of nucleotides.
* When there are multiple ways to decode the genome.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description, so I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no explicit parameters, but it reads two inputs: an integer n and a string s of length n, where n is an integer such that 4 ≤ n ≤ 255, and s is a string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    s = input()
    count = {'A': 0, 'C': 0, 'G': 0, 'T': 0}
    for c in s:
        if c != '?':
            count[c] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value represents the count of the respective character in `s`.
    avg = n // 4
    for c in 'ACGT':
        count[c] = avg - count[c]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string, `avg` is an integer between 1 and 63 (inclusive) equal to `n // 4`, and `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value `count[c]` is `n // 4 - count_original[c]`, with `count_original[c]` being the original count of character `c` before the loop execution.
    res = ''
    for c in s:
        if c == '?':
            for nc in 'ACGT':
                if count[nc] > 0:
                    res += nc
                    count[nc] -= 1
                    break
        else:
            res += c
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the fully processed input string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' and values decremented by the number of times each nucleotide was used to replace '?' in `s`, `res` is the resulting string after replacing all '?' in `s` with the available nucleotides from `count`.
    if any(count.values()) :
        print('===')
    else :
        print(res)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the fully processed input string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `res` is the resulting string after replacing all '?' in `s` with the available nucleotides from `count`. If at least one of the values in the `count` dictionary is greater than 0, '===' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, the string `res` has been returned at the output, with all values in the `count` dictionary being 0, indicating that all available nucleotides have been used to replace '?' in `s`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is between 4 and 255 (inclusive), and `s` consists of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', replaces '?' in `s` with 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' to achieve a balance of `n // 4` for each character, and prints the resulting string if all available characters are used, or '===' if there are remaining characters; if the input does not meet the specified conditions, the function's behavior is undefined

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
