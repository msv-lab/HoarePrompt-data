Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 1 character, `avg` is `n // 4`, if `count['A']` is greater than 0, then `count['A']` is decremented by 1, `res` is set to 'A', and `c` remains '?' and `nc` remains 'A', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged**
