The value of `res` is increased by `c`, where `c` is the third character in the string `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the third character in the string `s`, `c` is not equal to '?', and `res` is increased by the third character `c` in string `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the third character in the string `s`, `c` is not equal to '?', and `res` is the original value of `res` plus `c`.**
