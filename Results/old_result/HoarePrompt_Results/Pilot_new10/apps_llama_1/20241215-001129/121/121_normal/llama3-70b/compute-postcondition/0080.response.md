The given code is `count[nc] -= 1`. Here, `nc` is 'G'. 

So, `count['G']` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the third character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'G', `res` is the original value of `res` plus 'G', and `count['G']` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the third character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'G', `res` is the original value of `res` plus 'G', and `count['G']` is the original value of `count['G']` minus 1**
