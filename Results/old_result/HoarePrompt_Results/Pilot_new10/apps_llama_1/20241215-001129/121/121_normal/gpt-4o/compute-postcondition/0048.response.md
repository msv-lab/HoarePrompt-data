Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value is the total count of the respective character in `s`, `char` is 'C', if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts['C']` is the total count of 'C' in `s` plus 1 and `result` is a list of characters with 'C' added to it and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise `counts` and `result` remain unchanged***
