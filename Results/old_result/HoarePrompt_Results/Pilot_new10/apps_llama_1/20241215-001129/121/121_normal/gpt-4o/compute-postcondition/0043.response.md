Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?`, `target_count` is `n // 4`, `counts` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T' where each value is the total count of the respective character in `s`, if `counts[char]` is less than `target_count`, then `counts[char]` is incremented by 1, `result` is a list of characters where the first character is `char` and the rest are equal to `list(s)[1:]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, otherwise, no changes are made to `counts` and `result`.***
