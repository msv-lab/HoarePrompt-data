The code `data = input().split()` is given the initial state: `input` is a string containing the entire standard input, `n` is the first line of `input` which is an integer and 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, and the second line of `input` is a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

However, the code `data = input().split()` reads the entire standard input and splits it into a list of strings using whitespace as the delimiter.

So, `data` will contain the first line of `input` which is `n` and the second line of `input` which is `s` in the list.

Output State: **`n` is the first element of `data` which is an integer and 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, and the second element of `data` is a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `data` is a list containing two strings where the first string can be converted to an integer `n` and the second string is `s`**
