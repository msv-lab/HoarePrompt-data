Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the third character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'C'. If `count['C']` is greater than 0, then `res` is `initial_res + 'C'`, `count['C']` is `count['C'] - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
