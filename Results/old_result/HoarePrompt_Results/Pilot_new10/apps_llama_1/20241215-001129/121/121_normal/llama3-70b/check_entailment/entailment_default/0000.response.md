Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to be correct as it accurately implements the problem description for every potential case. 

The code first counts the occurrences of each valid nucleotide ('A', 'C', 'G', 'T') in the string `s`, then calculates the target count for each nucleotide by dividing the total length `n` by 4. 

Next, it constructs a resulting string `res` by replacing each unrecognized nucleotide '?' with the first available nucleotide from 'ACGT' that has a remaining count greater than 0.

Finally, it checks if all the available characters are used (i.e., all counts are 0) and prints either the resulting string `res` or '===' depending on the outcome. 

This approach correctly addresses the problem's requirements as it replaces '?' characters with valid nucleotides while ensuring that each type of nucleotide appears an equal number of times. The provided examples also validate the code's correctness, as it produces the expected outputs for each case.

The output hints also agree with the code and provide no indication of incorrectness. Overall, the code seems to handle all potential cases correctly and produce the expected results according to the problem description.
