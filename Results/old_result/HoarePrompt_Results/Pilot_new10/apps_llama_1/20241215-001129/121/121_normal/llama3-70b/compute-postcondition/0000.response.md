The given code reads an integer input and assigns it to the variable `n`. 

The value of `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255. The string `s` is still a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.


Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.**
