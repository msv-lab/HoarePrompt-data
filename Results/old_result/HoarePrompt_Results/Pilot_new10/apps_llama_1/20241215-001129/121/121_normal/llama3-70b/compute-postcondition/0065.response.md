Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the second character in the string `s`. If `c` is '?', then `res` is the original value of `res` plus the first character in 'ACGT' that has a count greater than 0. If `c` is not '?', then `res` is the original value of `res` (which depends on `c`) plus the character `c`.**
