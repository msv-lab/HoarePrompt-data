The code calculates `target_count` as `n // 4`. Given that `n` is a multiple of 4 and 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, `n // 4` will be an integer between 1 and 63 (because 4 // 4 = 1 and 252 // 4 = 63, since 255 is not a multiple of 4, we consider 252 as the highest multiple of 4 within the given range).

The states of `n`, `data`, and `s` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, `n` remains an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` remains a list with the first element as the string representation of `n` and the second element as a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and `s` remains a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer and a multiple of 4 between 4 and 255, `data` is a list where the first element is the string representation of `n` and the second element is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', `target_count` is `n // 4`**
