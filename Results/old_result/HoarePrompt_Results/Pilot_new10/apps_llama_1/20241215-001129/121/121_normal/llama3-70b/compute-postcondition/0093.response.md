The function `func` does not take explicit parameters but reads two inputs: an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`. `n` is an integer such that 4 ≤ `n` ≤ 255, and `s` is a string consisting of characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?'. 

Since the specific return values are not provided in the problem statement, we will describe the functionality based on the given input constraints.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer `n` and a string `s` of length `n`, where `n` is between 4 and 255 (inclusive), and `s` consists of the characters 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', and '?', and returns a value based on these inputs.**
