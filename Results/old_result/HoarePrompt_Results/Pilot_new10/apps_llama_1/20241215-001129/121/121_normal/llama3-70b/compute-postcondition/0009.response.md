Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in `s`. If `c` is not '?', then `count` is a dictionary where the value associated with `c` is increased by 1. If `c` is '?', then either an error is thrown if '?' is not a key in `count` or `count` remains unchanged if it's not a dictionary with '?' as a key or if there's no handling for this case; however, given there's no explicit else part, the specific behavior when `c` equals '?' isn't defined beyond potential error conditions related to `count` and its handling of '?'.**
