Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the fully processed input string, `avg` is `n // 4`, `count` is a dictionary with keys 'A', 'C', 'G', 'T', `res` is the resulting string after replacing all '?' in `s` with the available nucleotides from `count`. If at least one of the values in the `count` dictionary is greater than 0, '===' has been printed to the console. Otherwise, the string `res` has been returned at the output, with all values in the `count` dictionary being 0, indicating that all available nucleotides have been used to replace '?' in `s`.**
