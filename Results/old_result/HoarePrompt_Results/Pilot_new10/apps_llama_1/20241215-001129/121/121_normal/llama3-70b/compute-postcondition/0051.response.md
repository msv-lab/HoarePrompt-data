Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 2 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the second character in the string `s`. If `count['A']` is greater than 0, `res` is the previous value of `res` plus 'A', and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `nc` remains 'A'.**
