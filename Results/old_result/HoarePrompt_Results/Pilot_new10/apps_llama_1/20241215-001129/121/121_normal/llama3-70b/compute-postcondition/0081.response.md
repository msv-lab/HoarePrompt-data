The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 4 and 255 (inclusive), `s` is the input string that must have at least 3 characters, `avg` is `n // 4`, `c` is the third character in the string `s`, `nc` is 'G', `res` is the original value of `res` plus 'G', and `count['G']` is the original value of `count['G']` minus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
