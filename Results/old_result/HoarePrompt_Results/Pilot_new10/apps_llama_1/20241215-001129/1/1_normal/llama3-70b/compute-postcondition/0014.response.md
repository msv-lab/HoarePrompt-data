Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is '[', then `ind` is -1 and `f` is True. If the character at index `i` of `s` is ':', then if the character at index `i` of `s` was previously '[' (implying `f` is True), `ind` is 0; otherwise, `ind` remains -1. For any other character at index `i` of `s`, the state of `ind` and `f` remains unchanged.**
