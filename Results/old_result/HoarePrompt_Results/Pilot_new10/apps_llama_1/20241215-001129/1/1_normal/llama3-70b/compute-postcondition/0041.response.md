Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and must be at least 1, `i` is `n-1`, and if the character at index `i` in `s` is ':', then the last character of `s` (i.e., `s[i]`) is ':' and not ']'. If `f` is `True`, then `ind` is -1, `bind` is `n-1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `f` is `False` or the character at index `i` in `s` is not ':', then the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `f` still `False`, `ind` still -1, and `bind` still -1.***
