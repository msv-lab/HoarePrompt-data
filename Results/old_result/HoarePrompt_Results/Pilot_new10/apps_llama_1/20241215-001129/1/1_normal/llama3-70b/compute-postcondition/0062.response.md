The given code prints -1. This action does not affect the values of any variables. 
The Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `i` is -1, `f` is `True` if `s` contains at least one `']'`, the current value of `ind` is the index of a specific character and is not -1, the current value of `bind` is the index of the first `':'` encountered after a `']'` from the end of `s` and is not -1. The current value of `ind` is greater than or equal to the current value of `bind`, and -1 has been printed.
