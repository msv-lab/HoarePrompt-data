The given code `end_colon = i` assigns the value of `i` to `end_colon`. 

Given that `i` is `bind - 2`, `end_colon` becomes `bind - 2`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `bind` is the index of the first ']' character from the end of `s` and `bind - 2` is greater than or equal to `ind`, `i` is `bind - 2`, `start_colon` remains unchanged, `end_colon` is `bind - 2`.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `bind` is the index of the first ']' character from the end of `s` and `bind - 2` is greater than or equal to `ind`, `i` is `bind - 2`, `start_colon` remains unchanged, `end_colon` is `bind - 2`**
