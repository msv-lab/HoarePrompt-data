Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s`, `bind` is the index of the first ']' character from the end of `s` and `bind - 1` is greater than or equal to `ind`, `i` is `bind - 1`, if `s[i]` is ':', then `start_colon` is the index of the first ':' character in `s` between `ind + 1` and `bind - 1`, `end_colon` is `bind - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `end_colon` still being -1.***
