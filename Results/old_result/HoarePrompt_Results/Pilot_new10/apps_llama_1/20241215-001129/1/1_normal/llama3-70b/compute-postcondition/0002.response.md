The code introduces a new variable `ind` and assigns it the value `-1`. The previous values of `s` and `n` are not affected by this code. 

The value of `s` is still a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive). The value of `n` is still an integer equal to the length of `s`, between 1 and 500000 (inclusive).

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is -1**
