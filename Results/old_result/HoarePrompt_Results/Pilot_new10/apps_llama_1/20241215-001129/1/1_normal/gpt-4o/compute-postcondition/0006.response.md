The code `break` terminates the loop it is currently inside. None of the variables are changed by this statement. Therefore, the states of `s`, `n`, `ind`, and `i` remain the same, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer greater than 0, `ind` is 0, `i` is 0, and the current value of `s` at index `i` is '[' and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
