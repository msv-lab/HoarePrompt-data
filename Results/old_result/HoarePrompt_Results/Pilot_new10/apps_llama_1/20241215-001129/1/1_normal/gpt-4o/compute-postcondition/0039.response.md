The code snippet is `break`. This statement is used to terminate the loop or switch statement that it is currently inside. 

When `break` is executed, the values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or switch statement we were directly inside.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, and |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `ind` is the index of the first '[' character in `s` and not -1, `i` is `ind + 1`, `bind` is the index of the first ']' character from the end of `s` and not -1, `ind` is less than `bind`, `start_colon` is `ind + 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
