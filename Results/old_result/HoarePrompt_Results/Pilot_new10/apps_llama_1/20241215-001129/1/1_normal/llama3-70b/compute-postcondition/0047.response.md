Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is at least 2, `i` is `n-2`. If the condition `f` is met, then `bind` is `n-2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition `f` is not met, then the state of the program remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
