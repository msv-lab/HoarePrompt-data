Postcondition: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s` and is at least 2, `i` is `n-2`. If `s[i]` is ']', then `f` is `True`. If `s[i]` is ':', then `bind` is `n-2` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `s[i]` is neither ']' nor ':', then the state of the program remains unchanged.**
