Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase Latin letters and characters [, ], :, |, with a length between 1 and 500000 (inclusive), `n` is an integer equal to the length of `s`, `f` is `True` if `s` contains at least one `']'`. If `ind` is -1 or `bind` is -1, the program outputs -1, `i` remains -1. If `ind` and `bind` are not -1, then `i` is either -1 or `bind - 1`, and the program either outputs -1 when `ind` is greater than or equal to `bind`, or returns 4 plus the number of '|' characters in the substring of `s` from `ind + 1` to `bind - 1` when `ind` is less than `bind`.***
