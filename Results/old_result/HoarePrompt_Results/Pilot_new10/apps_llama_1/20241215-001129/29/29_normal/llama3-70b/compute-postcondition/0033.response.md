According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `script` list. If the list has at least 2 strings, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, `script` has at least 1 string (since `i` equals `len(script)` and `i` must be at least 1), the first string in `script` has been printed. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `script` must have at least 2 strings, and `line` must be the second string in the `script` list, and `i` must be equal to `len(script)` which is now at least 2.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list containing at least 2 strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in `examples` and all filenames in `regular`, `i` equals `len(script)` which is at least 2, `line` is the second string in `script`, `file` is the last filename in `regular` if `regular` is not empty**
