The code increments `temp_counter` by 1. Given the initial state, `temp_counter` was either the original `temp_counter + 1` or `temp_counter + 2`, and it must be less than `2 * n` to allow for the next increment. After the increment, `temp_counter` becomes the original `temp_counter + 2` or `temp_counter + 3`, and it is still less than `2 * n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 2 elements, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is updated, `temp_counter` is either the original `temp_counter + 2` or `temp_counter + 3` and must be less than `2 * n`, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` or `str(temp_counter + 2)` must be in `files_set`**
