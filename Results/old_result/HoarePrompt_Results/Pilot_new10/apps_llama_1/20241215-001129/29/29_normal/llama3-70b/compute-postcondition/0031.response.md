According to the code, the loop will execute if the `script` list is not empty. For the `script` list to be not empty, either `examples` or `regular` (or both) must have at least one filename. The `script` list contains strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in `examples` and all filenames in `regular`. 

Since `i` equals `len(script)` if `regular` is not empty, for the loop to execute, `i` should be at least 1 if `regular` is not empty. If `regular` is empty, then `examples` must have at least one filename for the loop to execute.

The state before the loop needs to be adjusted to ensure that `script` is not empty, which means either `examples` or `regular` (or both) must have at least one filename.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1 that must have at least one filename if `regular` is empty, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0 that must have at least one filename if `examples` is empty, `script` is a list containing strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in `examples` and all filenames in `regular` and must have at least one string, `i` equals `len(script)` if `regular` is not empty and must be at least 1, `file` is the last filename in `regular` if `regular` is not empty, and the value `len(examples) + len(regular)` has been printed, `line` is the first string in `script`**
