The provided code snippet is a simple print statement that prints the value of the `line` variable. 

The value of `line` is the second string in the `script` list. Since `script` contains at least 2 strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in `examples` and all filenames in `regular`, the `line` will be one of these strings.

The values of the other variables are not affected by the print statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list containing at least 2 strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in `examples` and all filenames in `regular`, `i` equals `len(script)` which is at least 2, `line` is the second string in `script`, `file` is the last filename in `regular` if `regular` is not empty, and the second string in `script` has been printed**
