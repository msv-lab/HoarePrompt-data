The code `name, type_ = input().split()` splits the input into two parts and assigns the first part to `name` and the second part to `type_`. 

The values of `n`, `files`, and `_` are not affected by this code. 

The new values of `name` and `type_` are input string split into two parts, where the first part is assigned to `name` and the second part is assigned to `type_`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the first part of the input string, `type_` is the second part of the input string, `files` is a list containing at least two tuples (the original tuple(s) and the new tuple `(name, int(type_))`), `_` is 2**
