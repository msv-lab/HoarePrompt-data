To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**  
   At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1` which is less than or equal to `2 * n` or equal to `2 * n + 1`. For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` must not exceed `2 * n` because once it does, this condition will be false, and the loop will terminate. Thus, the state of `temp_counter` needs to be such that it is less than or equal to `2 * n` for the loop to potentially execute again.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**  
   The presence of `str(temp_counter)` in `files_set` is crucial for the loop to continue. If `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, the loop will terminate. Since we are not given any information about how `files_set` is updated or its current contents except that `str(temp_counter)` is in it, we must ensure this condition remains true for the next iteration.

Given these conditions and the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of `n` tuples.
- `examples` retains its original value.
- `regulars` must have at least 3 elements.
- `file`, `name`, and `type_` will be updated to the next file's values.
- `i` is 2.
- `target` is `len(examples) + 3`.
- `temp_counter` is `temp_counter + 1` which is less than or equal to `2 * n` or equal to `2 * n + 1` with `str(temp_counter)` in `files_set`.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `temp_counter` does not exceed `2 * n` and that `str(temp_counter)` remains in `files_set`. The other variables' states (`n`, `files`, `examples`, `regulars`, `file`, `name`, `type_`, `i`, `target`) do not directly affect the loop condition, so they do not need adjustment based on the information given.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 3 elements, `file`, `name`, and `type_` will be updated to the next file's values, `i` is 2, `target` is `len(examples) + 3`, and `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` with `str(temp_counter)` in `files_set`.**
