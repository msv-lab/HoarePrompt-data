To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement, which are `temp_counter <= 2 * n` and `str(temp_counter) in files_set`. Given the state right before the loop:

- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of `n` tuples.
- `examples` retains its original value.
- `regulars` must have at least 3 elements.
- `file`, `name`, and `type_` will be updated to the next file's values.
- `i` is 2.
- `target` is `len(examples) + 3`.

We are not given the value of `temp_counter` or `files_set` explicitly, but since `files` is a list of `n` tuples and assuming `files_set` is derived from `files` (though not directly provided, we can infer it's related to the task), for the loop to execute:

1. **`temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n`**: Since `n` is a positive integer, `2 * n` will also be a positive integer. The initial value of `temp_counter` is not provided, but for the loop to execute at least once, `temp_counter` should be less than or equal to `2 * n`.

2. **`str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set`**: This implies that the string representation of `temp_counter` must correspond to a value that can be found within `files_set`. Without the exact composition of `files_set`, we must assume it contains string representations of numbers (or at least one such number) that could match `temp_counter`.

Given these conditions, the states that need adjustment or specification for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `temp_counter` should be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
- `str(temp_counter)` should be present in `files_set`.
- The other states (`n` being a positive integer, `files` being a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retaining its original value, `regulars` having at least 3 elements, and the values of `file`, `name`, `type_`, `i`, and `target`) do not directly impact the loop's ability to execute based on the given `while` loop condition.

However, since the task is to modify the program state so that the first iteration of the `while` loop can proceed and considering the loop's conditions, we should ensure that `temp_counter` is appropriately set and that `files_set` contains the necessary string representations. Without direct information on `temp_counter` and `files_set`, we cannot modify their states directly from the provided information. Thus, based on the given task format and the information provided:

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 3 elements, `file`, `name`, and `type_` will be updated to the next file's values, `i` is 2, `target` is `len(examples) + 3`, and `temp_counter` must be less than or equal to `2 * n` with `str(temp_counter)` in `files_set`**.
