Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of at least 3 tuples, `file` is the third file in the list, `name` is the first part of the string representation of `file` after splitting, `type_` is the second part of the string representation of `file` after splitting. If `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing at least three occurrences of `name` and `regulars` is a list containing `name`. If `type_` is not '1', then `examples` is a list containing one occurrence of `name` and `regulars` is a list containing at least three occurrences of `name`.***
