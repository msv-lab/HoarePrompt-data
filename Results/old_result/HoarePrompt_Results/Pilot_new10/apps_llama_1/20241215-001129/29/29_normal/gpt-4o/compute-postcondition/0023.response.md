Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" that must have at least 1 element, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is an empty list, `temp_counter` is `n + 1`, and `i` is 0. The current value of `examples` at index `i` is not equal to the string representation of `i + 1`, meaning `examples[0]` is not equal to "1".**
