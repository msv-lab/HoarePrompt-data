To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided information and the loop condition.

Given:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of `n` tuples.
- `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1".
- `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0".
- `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed.
- `i` is 0.
- The conditionals regarding `examples[0]`, `temp_counter`, and `moves` depend on whether `examples[0]` is equal to '1' or not.

The loop is `for i in range(len(examples)):`. This means the loop will iterate over the indices of the `examples` list. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(examples) - 1`, because the range function in Python generates numbers up to but not including the stop value.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `i` is 0.
- The state of `examples`, `temp_counter`, and `moves` can vary based on the initial value of `examples[0]`.

For the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1.
- The length of `examples` must be at least 2, because if it were 1, the loop would only execute once (when `i` is 0), and then it would terminate.
- The values of `file`, `name`, and `type_` would be updated based on the next file processed, but the specifics of these updates depend on the loop body, which is not provided.
- If `examples[0]` is not equal to '1', then `temp_counter` would have been incremented by 1, and `moves` would contain additional moves based on the previous value of `examples[0]`. If `examples[0]` is equal to '1', then these variables remain unchanged.

However, considering the initial conditions and the fact that we are only dealing with the loop's condition and not its body, the critical adjustments for the loop to execute again are:
- `i` must increase by 1.
- The length of `examples` must support at least one more iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" and must have at least 2 elements, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the next file to be processed, `i` is 1**
