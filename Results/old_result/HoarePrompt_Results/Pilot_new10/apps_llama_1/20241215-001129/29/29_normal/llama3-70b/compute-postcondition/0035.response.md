To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `name` is the last filename read
- `type_` is the last type read
- `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types
- `_` is the last index value of `n-1`
- `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1
- `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0
- `script` is a list containing at least 2 strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in `examples` and all filenames in `regular`
- `i` equals `len(script)` which is at least 2
- `line` is the second string in `script`
- `file` is the last filename in `regular` if `regular` is not empty
- The second string in `script` has been printed

Loop statement:
```python
for line in script:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute one more time, it depends on the `script` list having more than one element since the loop iterates over each element in `script`. At the end of the previous iteration, `line` is the second string in `script`, and `i` equals `len(script)`.

To execute one more time:
- `script` must have at least 3 strings because the loop has already executed once (for the first string) and the current state reflects the second string being processed.
- `i` should still equal `len(script)` but since `script` now has to have at least 3 elements, `i` must be at least 3.
- `line` should be the third string in `script` for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list containing at least 3 strings in the format `f'move {file} {i}'` for each filename in `examples` and all filenames in `regular`, `i` equals `len(script)` which is at least 3, `line` is the third string in `script`, `file` is the last filename in `regular` if `regular` is not empty**
