Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `target` is `len(examples) + 3`. If `regulars[2]` is not equal to `str(len(examples) + 3)`, then `regulars[2]` is `str(temp_counter - 1)`, `temp_counter` is incremented by 1, and `moves` includes the string 'move {regulars[2]} {temp_counter - 1}'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged.**
