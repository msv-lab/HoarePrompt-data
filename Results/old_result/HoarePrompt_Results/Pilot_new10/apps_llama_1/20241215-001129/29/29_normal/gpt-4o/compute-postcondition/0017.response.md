The code `regulars.append(name)` adds `name` to the end of the `regulars` list. 

- The value of `n` is not affected.
- The value of `files` is not affected.
- The value of `file` is not affected.
- The value of `name` is not affected.
- The value of `type_` is not affected.
- If `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing at least two occurrences of `name` and this is not affected. However, `regulars` is supposed to be an empty list in this case, but now it contains `name`.
- If `type_` is not '1', then `examples` is an empty list and this is not affected. `regulars` is a list containing at least two occurrences of `name` and now it contains at least three occurrences of `name` (the original two plus the newly appended one).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of at least 3 tuples, `file` is the third file in the list, `name` is the first part of the string representation of `file` after splitting, `type_` is the second part of the string representation of `file` after splitting, if `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing at least two occurrences of `name` and `regulars` is a list containing `name`, if `type_` is not '1', then `examples` is an empty list and `regulars` is a list containing at least three occurrences of `name`**
