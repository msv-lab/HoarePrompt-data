Precondition: **n is a positive integer, and files is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains a filename (a string of digits and small English letters with length from 1 to 6 characters) and a type (either "0" for a regular test or "1" for an example test), such that the filenames are distinct and the number of files is equal to n.**
