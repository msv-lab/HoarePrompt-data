The code `files.sort(key=lambda x: x[1], reverse=True)` sorts the list `files` in descending order based on the second element of each tuple (i.e., the type of each file). This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `name`, `type_`, or `_`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`**
