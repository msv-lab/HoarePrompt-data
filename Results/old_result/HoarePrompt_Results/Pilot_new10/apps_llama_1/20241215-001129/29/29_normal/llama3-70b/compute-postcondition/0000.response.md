The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. The input consists of an integer `n` (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^5) followed by `n` lines, each containing a string filename and an integer type. 

The value of `n` is now known to be an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), which is the number of lines that will follow. The states of the other variables (filename and type) are not yet defined, as they will be defined in the following lines.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), the input consists of `n` lines, each containing a string filename and an integer type, where the filenames are guaranteed to be distinct.**
