The code appends a string to the `script` list. The string is in the format 'move {file} {i}', where `file` is the first filename in the `examples` list and `i` is 1. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), 
`name` is the last filename read, 
`type_` is the last type read, 
`files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, 
`_` is the last index value of `n-1`, 
`examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1 and must have at least 1 filename, 
`regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, 
`script` is a list containing the string 'move {first filename in examples list} 1', 
`i` is 1, 
`file` is the first filename in the `examples` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the last filename read, `type_` is the last type read, `files` is a sorted list of `n` tuples containing filenames and their corresponding types in descending order of types, `_` is the last index value of `n-1`, `examples` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 1 and must have at least 1 filename, `regular` is a list of filenames from `files` where the type is 0, `script` is a list containing the string f'move {first filename in examples list} 1', `i` is 1, `file` is the first filename in the `examples` list**
