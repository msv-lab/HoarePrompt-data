Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 2 elements, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `i` is 1, and `target` is `len(examples) + 2`. The current value of `regulars[i]` is not equal to the string representation of `target`, meaning `regulars[i]` is not equal to `str(target)`.**
