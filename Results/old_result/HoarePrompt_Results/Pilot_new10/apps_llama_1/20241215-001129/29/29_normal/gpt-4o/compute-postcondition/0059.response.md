The value of `temp_counter` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `temp_counter` was 4, so the new value of `temp_counter` is 5. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer and must be sufficiently large, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" and must have at least 3 elements, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the next file to be processed, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` is 5, and `files_set` must contain "2", "3", and potentially "5" for the loop to execute again.
