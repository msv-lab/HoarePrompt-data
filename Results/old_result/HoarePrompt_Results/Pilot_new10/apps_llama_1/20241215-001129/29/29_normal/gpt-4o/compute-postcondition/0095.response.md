To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables involved.

The initial state specifies that `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, with `n` being a positive integer. The code snippet to execute is:

```python
moves.append(f'move {regulars[i]} {temp_counter}')
```

This line of code appends a string to the list `moves`. The string includes the value of `regulars[i]` and `temp_counter`. 

To evaluate the impact:

1. `moves` is a list that now includes an additional string element, specifically `'move ' + regulars[i] + ' ' + str(temp_counter)`.
2. The value of `temp_counter` does not change; it remains greater than `2 * n` or its string representation is not in `files_set`.
3. The value of `n` remains unchanged as a positive integer.
4. The state of `regulars` and `i` is not directly modified by this operation, but `regulars[i]` is used to construct the appended string, implying `i` is a valid index for `regulars`.

Given this analysis, the output state includes the initial conditions with the update that `moves` now has an additional element based on the values of `regulars[i]` and `temp_counter`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `temp_counter` is greater than `2 * n` or `str(temp_counter)` is not in `files_set`, and `moves` includes an additional element `'move ' + regulars[i] + ' ' + str(temp_counter)`**
