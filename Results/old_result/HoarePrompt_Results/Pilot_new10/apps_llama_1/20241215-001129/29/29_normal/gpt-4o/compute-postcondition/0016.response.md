The code appends `name` to the `examples` list. Initially, if `type_` is '1', `examples` contains at least two occurrences of `name` and `regulars` is empty. If `type_` is not '1', `examples` is empty and `regulars` contains at least two occurrences of `name`. 

After executing the code, `examples` will have an additional `name` appended to it, regardless of the initial `type_`. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of at least 3 tuples, `file` is the third file in the list, `name` is the first part of the string representation of `file` after splitting, `type_` is the second part of the string representation of `file` after splitting, if `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing at least three occurrences of `name` and `regulars` is an empty list, if `type_` is not '1', then `examples` is a list containing one occurrence of `name` and `regulars` is a list containing at least two occurrences of `name`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of at least 3 tuples, `file` is the third file in the list, `name` is the first part of the string representation of `file` after splitting, `type_` is the second part of the string representation of `file` after splitting, if `type_` is '1', then `examples` is a list containing at least three occurrences of `name` and `regulars` is an empty list, if `type_` is not '1', then `examples` is a list containing one occurrence of `name` and `regulars` is a list containing at least two occurrences of `name`.**
