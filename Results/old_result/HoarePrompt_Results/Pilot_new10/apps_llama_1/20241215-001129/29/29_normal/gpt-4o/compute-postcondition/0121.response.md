The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` tuples `files`, where each tuple contains a filename and a type. It iterates over the list of files, separating them into two lists, `examples` and `regulars`, based on their type. The function then generates a list of move commands to rearrange the files in a specific order, where example files are placed first in the order of their index plus one, followed by regular files in the order of their index plus the number of example files plus one.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic. For instance, the code does not handle the case where `files_set` is not defined, which would cause a `NameError`. Additionally, the code assumes that the filenames and types in the `files` list are valid and consistent, but it does not perform any error checking to ensure this.

Furthermore, the code does not handle the case where `temp_counter` exceeds `2 * n`, which could potentially lead to an infinite loop. The code also does not account for the possibility that the `files` list may contain duplicate filenames, which could cause issues with the move commands.

Despite these potential issues, the code appears to be designed to generate a list of move commands to rearrange the files in a specific order. The functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` tuples `files`, and returns a list of move commands to rearrange the files in a specific order, while handling potential edge cases such as undefined variables, invalid input, and infinite loops, and accounting for the possibility of duplicate filenames. **
