To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the conditions in the `while` loop statement:

1. `temp_counter <= 2 * n`: This condition indicates that as long as `temp_counter` is less than or equal to twice the value of `n`, this part of the condition is met. Since `temp_counter` is either the original `temp_counter + 2` or `temp_counter + 3` and must be less than `2 * n` at the end of the previous iteration, this condition is already met for the next iteration to begin.

2. `str(temp_counter) in files_set`: This condition requires that the string representation of `temp_counter` must be present in `files_set` for the loop to continue. Given that `str(temp_counter + 1)` or `str(temp_counter + 2)` must be in `files_set` at the end of the previous iteration, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to consider the implications of `temp_counter` being incremented from its current state.

Considering `temp_counter` is either `temp_counter + 2` or `temp_counter + 3` from its original value and is less than `2 * n`, and `str(temp_counter + 1)` or `str(temp_counter + 2)` must be in `files_set`, for the loop to execute again:

- The value of `temp_counter` itself does not need adjustment since it's already within the required bounds for the next iteration (`temp_counter <= 2 * n`).
- However, to ensure `str(temp_counter) in files_set` for the next iteration, given `str(temp_counter + 1)` or `str(temp_counter + 2)` was in `files_set` previously, we must adjust our understanding such that now `str(temp_counter + 1)` (if considering the `+2` increment scenario) or `str(temp_counter + 2)` (if considering the `+3` increment scenario) must be in `files_set` for the loop condition to be potentially true the next time it checks.

Thus, for the next iteration, `temp_counter` can remain as is because it's the conditions related to `files_set` and the increments of `temp_counter` that dictate the loop's continuation. Given `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, `n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 2 elements, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, and `moves` is updated, none of these states need adjustment based on the loop condition provided.

The critical adjustment in understanding is recognizing that for the loop to potentially execute again, the conditions regarding `temp_counter` and its relation to `files_set` must be satisfied. Since we're considering the scenario where the loop can execute one more time, and given `temp_counter`'s current state and the requirement that it must be less than `2 * n`, the states related to `temp_counter` and the set inclusion do not need direct adjustment in the provided format but rather an understanding of how these conditions affect loop continuation.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` retains its original value, `regulars` must have at least 2 elements, `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the last file processed, `moves` is updated, `temp_counter` is either the original `temp_counter + 2` or `temp_counter + 3` and must be less than `2 * n`, `i` is 1, `target` is `len(examples) + 2`, and `str(temp_counter)` must be in `files_set` for the loop to execute again**
