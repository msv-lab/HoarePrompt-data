The code `files.append((name, int(type_)))` appends a new tuple `(name, int(type_))` to the list `files`. 

The state of `n` is not affected. `name` is also not affected as it is just used in the append operation. `type_` is not affected as it is just used in the append operation and converted to an integer. `_` is not affected as it is not used in this operation.

`files` was initially a list containing at least two tuples (the original tuple(s) and the new tuple `(name, int(type_))`), but now `files` will contain all the initial tuples plus the new tuple `(name, int(type_))`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 10^5 (inclusive), `name` is the first part of the input string, `type_` is the second part of the input string, `files` is a list containing at least three tuples (the original tuple(s) and the two new tuple `(name, int(type_))`), `_` is 2**
