To calculate the output state, we need to understand what the given code does. The code `name, type_ = file.split()` splits the string `file` into two parts at the first whitespace character and assigns these parts to the variables `name` and `type_`, respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of `n` tuples, with at least 1 file.
- `examples` is an empty list.
- `regulars` is an empty list.
- `file` is the first file in the list.

The code affects the variables `name` and `type_` by assigning them values based on the first file in the list. Since `file` is a tuple and we're using the `split()` method on it, we must assume that the tuple is unpacked or that the first element of the tuple is a string that can be split.

The output state is therefore:
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `files` is a list of `n` tuples, with at least 1 file.
- `examples` is an empty list.
- `regulars` is an empty list.
- `file` is the first file in the list.
- `name` is the first part of the string representation of the first file.
- `type_` is the second part of the string representation of the first file after the first whitespace character.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is an empty list, `regulars` is an empty list, `file` is the first file in the list, `name` is the first part of the string representation of the first file, `type_` is the second part of the string representation of the first file**
