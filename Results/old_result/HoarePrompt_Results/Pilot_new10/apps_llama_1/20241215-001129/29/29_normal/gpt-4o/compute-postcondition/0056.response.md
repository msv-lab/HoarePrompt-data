To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `temp_counter <= 2 * n and str(temp_counter) in files_set`.

1. **Condition 1: `temp_counter <= 2 * n`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `temp_counter` is 3, and `n` is a positive integer.
   - For the loop to execute again, `temp_counter` (which is 3) must be less than or equal to `2 * n`.
   - This implies that `2 * n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the condition to potentially be true, but since `n` is a positive integer, `2 * n` will always be greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, `n` being a positive integer is sufficient for this part of the condition to be potentially true when `temp_counter` is 3.

2. **Condition 2: `str(temp_counter) in files_set`**
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `files_set` must contain "2".
   - For the loop to execute again with `temp_counter` being 3, `str(temp_counter)` (which becomes "3") must be in `files_set`.
   - This means `files_set` needs to contain "3" for the loop to execute one more time.

Given these conditions, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time are:

- `temp_counter` needs to be such that it's less than or equal to `2 * n`, but since `temp_counter` is 3 and `n` is a positive integer, this part of the condition is likely satisfied if `n` is greater than or equal to 2. However, the problem statement already implies `n` is a positive integer, so no specific adjustment to `n` is necessary beyond what's already stated.
- `files_set` must contain "3" for the loop to execute again because `temp_counter` is 3 and its string representation needs to be in `files_set`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `files` is a list of `n` tuples, `examples` is a list of filenames of type "1" and must have at least 3 elements, `regulars` is a list of filenames of type "0", `file`, `name`, and `type_` hold the values of the next file to be processed, `i` is 2, `temp_counter` is 3, and `files_set` must contain "2" and "3"**
