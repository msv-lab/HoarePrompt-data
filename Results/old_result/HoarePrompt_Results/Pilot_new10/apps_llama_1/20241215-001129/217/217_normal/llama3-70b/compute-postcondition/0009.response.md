Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive), sorted in descending order. If `i` is even (i.e., `i` % 2 == 0), then `b` is set to `a[0]`, `c` is 0, and `i` is 0. If `i` is odd (i.e., `i` % 2!= 0), then `b` is 0, `c` is set to `a[i]`, and `i` is an odd number greater than or equal to 1 and less than 100.**
