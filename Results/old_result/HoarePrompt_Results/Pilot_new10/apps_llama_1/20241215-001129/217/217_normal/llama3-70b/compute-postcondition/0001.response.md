The code creates a list `a` where the elements are the integers from the input sequence, excluding the first integer `n`. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each element in the input sequence, converting them to integers. The `split` function splits the input sequence into a list of strings, using whitespace as the delimiter.

Since `n` is the first integer in the input sequence, it is not included in the list `a`. The list `a` will contain `n` elements, and each element will be an integer between -100 and 100, inclusive.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers, where each integer is between -100 and 100 (inclusive), representing the sequence (a_1, a_2,..., a_{n}).**
