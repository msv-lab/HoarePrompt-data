The value of `b` is increased by `a[i]`. The value of `a[i]` is an integer between -100 and 100 (inclusive) because `a` is a list of `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive). Since `a` is sorted in descending order and `i` is less than `n-2` (because `n` is greater than `i` plus 2), `a[i]` will be one of the larger integers in the list, but its exact value depends on the initial values of `a` and `i`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `n` is greater than the current `i` plus 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive), sorted in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1, and `b` is increased by `a[i]`, which is the integer at index `i` in list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than the current `i` plus 2, `a` is a list of `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive), sorted in descending order, `i` is incremented by 1, `b` is increased by the value of the integer at index `i` in list `a`.**
