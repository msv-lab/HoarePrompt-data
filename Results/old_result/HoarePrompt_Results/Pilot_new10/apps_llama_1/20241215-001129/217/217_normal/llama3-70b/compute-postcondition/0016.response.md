To determine the output state, let's analyze the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `n` is greater than the current `i` plus 2.
- `a` is a list of `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive), sorted in descending order.
- `i` is incremented by 1.

Given Code:
```python
c += a[i]
```

Impact Analysis:
- The value of `c` is increased by the value of `a` at index `i`.
- Since `a` is sorted in descending order, `a[i]` will be a value between -100 and 100.
- The exact value of `c` after the operation depends on its initial value (which is not specified) and the value of `a[i]`.
- The condition that `n` is greater than the current `i` plus 2 ensures that `i` is a valid index for list `a` before `i` was incremented.
- The states of `n`, `a`, and the incremented `i` are not affected by the operation on `c`.

Output State:
Since `i` is mentioned as "incremented by 1" in the initial state, we also consider this change in the output state. However, the exact new value of `i` depends on its previous value, which isn't specified. 

**`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` is greater than the current `i` plus 1 (considering `i` was incremented by 1), `a` is a list of `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive), sorted in descending order, `i` is the previous `i` plus 1, `c` is the previous `c` plus `a` at the index of the previous `i`.**
