The code snippet `a.sort(reverse=True)` sorts the list `a` in descending order. This operation only affects the list `a`, leaving the variable `n` unchanged. The list `a` initially contains `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive), and after sorting, it still contains the same integers but in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` integers between -100 and 100 (inclusive), sorted in descending order.**
