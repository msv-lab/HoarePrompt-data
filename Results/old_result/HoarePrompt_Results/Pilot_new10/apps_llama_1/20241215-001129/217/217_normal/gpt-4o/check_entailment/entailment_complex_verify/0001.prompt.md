You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a sequence a consisting of n integers. You may partition this sequence into two sequences b and c in such a way that every element belongs exactly to one of these sequences. 

Let B be the sum of elements belonging to b, and C be the sum of elements belonging to c (if some of these sequences is empty, then its sum is 0). What is the maximum possible value of B - C?


-----Input-----

The first line contains one integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) — the number of elements in a.

The second line contains n integers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} ( - 100 ≤ a_{i} ≤ 100) — the elements of sequence a.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements of sequence b, and C is the sum of elements of sequence c.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
1 -2 0

Output
3

Input
6
16 23 16 15 42 8

Output
120



-----Note-----

In the first example we may choose b = {1, 0}, c = { - 2}. Then B = 1, C =  - 2, B - C = 3.

In the second example we choose b = {16, 23, 16, 15, 42, 8}, c = {} (an empty sequence). Then B = 120, C = 0, B - C = 120.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum((x for x in a if x > 0))
    C = sum((x for x in a if x < 0))
    result = B - C
    print(result)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct. It correctly calculates the maximum possible value of B - C by partitioning the sequence into two sequences, b and c. The program sums up all positive elements to form sequence b and all negative elements to form sequence c. This way, it ensures that B is maximized (by including all positive numbers and zero, implicitly, as it doesn't contribute anything to C) and C is minimized (as it only includes negative numbers), thus maximizing the difference B - C.

The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, including the case where a sequence might be empty. Zeroes are implicitly handled as part of sequence b because they do not contribute to C (the sum of negative elements), and they do not decrease B (since their sum is 0). 

For example, given the input "3" followed by "1 -2 0", the program correctly outputs "3", which is the maximum possible value of B - C (B = 1 + 0 = 1, C = -2, so B - C = 3). Similarly, for the input "6" followed by "16 23 16 15 42 8", it outputs "120", which is also correct (B = 16 + 23 + 16 + 15 + 42 + 8 = 120, C = 0, so B - C = 120).

The key insight here is that the program does not need to explicitly consider zeros or the empty sequence case because its approach inherently maximizes B - C by summing all positive numbers and excluding all negative numbers from B, which effectively minimizes C to the sum of all negative numbers or zero if there are no negative numbers. This method ensures that B - C is as large as possible for any given sequence of integers.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The input is a sequence of n integers, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, and each integer in the sequence is in the range -100 ≤ a_i ≤ 100.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    B = sum(x for x in a if x > 0)
    C = sum(x for x in a if x < 0)
    result = B - C
    print(result)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a sequence of integers, calculates the difference between the sum of all positive integers and the sum of all negative integers in the sequence, and prints the result.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
