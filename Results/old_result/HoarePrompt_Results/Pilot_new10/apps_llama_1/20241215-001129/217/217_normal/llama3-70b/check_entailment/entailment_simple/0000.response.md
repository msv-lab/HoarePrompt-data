Correctness: **False**

The given program does not meet the problem description. The problem description asks for the maximum possible value of B - C, where B is the sum of elements belonging to sequence b, and C is the sum of elements belonging to sequence c. 

The provided program sorts the input sequence in descending order and then alternates elements between sequences b and c. This approach does not guarantee the maximum possible value of B - C. 

For example, consider the input sequence [1, -2, 0]. The program will assign 1 to sequence b and -2 to sequence c, resulting in B = 1 and C = -2. However, the optimal solution is to assign 1 and 0 to sequence b and -2 to sequence c, resulting in B = 1 and C = -2, but the program will not produce this result because it does not consider all possible partitions of the input sequence.

A correct approach would be to consider all possible subsets of the input sequence and calculate the difference between the sum of elements in the subset and the sum of elements not in the subset.

Here is a correct Python solution using bit manipulation to generate all possible subsets:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    max_diff = float('-inf')
    for mask in range(1 << n):
        b = sum([a[i] for i in range(n) if (mask & (1 << i))])
        c = sum([a[i] for i in range(n) if not (mask & (1 << i))])
        max_diff = max(max_diff, b - c)
    print(max_diff)
```

This solution generates all possible subsets of the input sequence using bit manipulation and calculates the difference between the sum of elements in the subset and the sum of elements not in the subset. The maximum difference found is the maximum possible value of B - C.
