Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it doesn't always find the maximum possible value of B - C. The current implementation assigns elements to sequences b and c in an alternating manner, but this doesn't guarantee the maximum difference between the sums of the two sequences.

For example, if the input is 4 integers: -10, -8, 1, 2, the program will assign -10 to b, -8 to c, 1 to b, and 2 to c, resulting in B = -9 and C = -6, and B - C = -3. However, the optimal assignment would be to put all the positive numbers in b and all the negative numbers in c, resulting in B = 3 and C = -18, and B - C = 21.

A correct approach would be to put all the positive numbers in b and all the negative numbers in c, since this will maximize the sum of b and minimize the sum of c, resulting in the maximum possible value of B - C. The program should be modified to achieve this. 

Here is the corrected code:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    b = sum(x for x in a if x > 0)
    c = sum(x for x in a if x <= 0)
    print(b - c)
```
This version of the function puts all the positive numbers in b and all the non-positive numbers in c, resulting in the maximum possible value of B - C.
