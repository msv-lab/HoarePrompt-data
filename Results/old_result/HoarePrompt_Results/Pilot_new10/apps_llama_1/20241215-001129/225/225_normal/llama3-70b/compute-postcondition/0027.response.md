Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is `n-1`, `last_vowel` is the index of the last vowel in `s` or -1 if `s` does not contain any vowels, and `max_jump` is the maximum possible jump between two vowels in `s` or 0 if `s` does not contain any vowels. The current value of `last_vowel` is not equal to `n - 1`, meaning the last vowel in `s` is not at the last index of `s`.**
