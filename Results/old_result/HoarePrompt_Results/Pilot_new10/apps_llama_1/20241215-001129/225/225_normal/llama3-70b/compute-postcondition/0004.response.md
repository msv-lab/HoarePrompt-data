The code introduces a new variable `last_vowel` and assigns it the value `-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s`, `max_jump` is 0, and `last_vowel` is -1.
