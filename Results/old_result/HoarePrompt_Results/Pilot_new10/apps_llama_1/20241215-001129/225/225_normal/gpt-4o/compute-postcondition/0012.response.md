According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the string `s`. If `i` is less than the length of `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100 and at least 2, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2. Since the loop condition is based on the length of `s`, for the loop to execute again, the length of `s` must be at least 3.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100 and at least 3, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}, `i` is 2**
