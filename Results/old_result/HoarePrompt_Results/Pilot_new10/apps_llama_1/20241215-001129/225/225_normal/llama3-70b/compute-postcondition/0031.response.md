The problem doesn't specify the exact parameters and their constraints for the function. However, based on the task description, I will make an assumption that the function `func` takes a string as an input. Here is the answer:


The function `func` accepts a parameter, which is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100. However, the output of the function is not provided in the task description.


Since the output is not specified, I will provide a generic description of the functionality.


Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty string of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100 and returns an unspecified output.**
