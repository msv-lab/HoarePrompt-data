According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 2, and for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2, so `n` must be at least 3. The state of `s`, `vowels`, `last_vowel`, and `max_jump` may be updated based on the loop body, but since the loop body is omitted, we can only infer the state changes based on the loop condition.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 3, `i` is 2, if `s[i]` is in `vowels`, then `last_vowel` is 2 and `max_jump` is at least 1**
