The code updates the value of `last_vowel` to be equal to `i`. Given that `i` is 2, `last_vowel` becomes 2. The other variables' states are not affected by this assignment. 

Since `last_vowel` is now 2, we can determine that `max_jump` is at least the maximum of its previous value and ((2 - `last_vowel`) // 2 + 1). Substituting `last_vowel` with 2, we get `max_jump` is at least the maximum of its previous value and ((2 - 2) // 2 + 1), which simplifies to `max_jump` is at least the maximum of its previous value and (0 // 2 + 1), and further simplifies to `max_jump` is at least the maximum of its previous value and 1.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is at least 3, `i` is 2, `last_vowel` is 2, and `max_jump` is at least the maximum of its previous value and 1**
