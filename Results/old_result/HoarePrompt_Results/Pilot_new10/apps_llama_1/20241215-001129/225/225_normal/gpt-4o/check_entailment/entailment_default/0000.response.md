Correctness: **True**

The provided code appears to correctly solve the problem. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns the minimum jump ability needed for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string, jumping only on vowels.

Here's a breakdown of how the code works:

1. It initializes a set of vowels and a `max_jump` variable to 1.
2. It iterates through the string, checking if each character is a vowel.
3. If a vowel is found, it updates `max_jump` with the maximum of the current `max_jump` and the distance between the current vowel and the previous vowel (or the start of the string if it's the first vowel).
4. After iterating through the string, it updates `max_jump` one last time with the distance between the last vowel and the end of the string.
5. Finally, it returns `max_jump`, which represents the minimum jump ability needed for the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string.

The output hints agree with the code, and the examples provided in the problem description also work correctly with the code. For instance:

* For the input "ABABBBACFEYUKOTT", the output is 4, which is correct because the minimum jump ability needed to reach the end of the string is 4 (from the 'A' at position 0 to the 'A' at position 4, and then from the 'A' at position 4 to the 'Y' at position 9, and finally from the 'Y' at position 9 to the end of the string).
* For the input "AAA", the output is 1, which is correct because the minimum jump ability needed to reach the end of the string is 1 (the Grasshopper can simply jump from one 'A' to the next).

Overall, the code seems to correctly implement the problem description, and the examples provided work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the code is **True**.
