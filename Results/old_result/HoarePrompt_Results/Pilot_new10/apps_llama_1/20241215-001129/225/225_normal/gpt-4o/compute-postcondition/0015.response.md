Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100 and at least 3, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}. If the character at index 2 of `s` is a vowel, then `i` is 2, `prev_pos` is 2, and `max_jump` is `max(max_jump, 0)`. If the character at index 2 of `s` is not a vowel, then the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part.**
