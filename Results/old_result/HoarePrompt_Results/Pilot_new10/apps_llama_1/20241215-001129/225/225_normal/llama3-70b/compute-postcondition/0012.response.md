The value of `last_vowel` is updated to be equal to `i`. The previous value of `last_vowel` was either -1 or 0. The value of `i` is 0. 

So `last_vowel` becomes 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is 'AEIOUY', `n` is the length of `s` and is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `last_vowel` is 0, and the current character of `s` at index `i` is a vowel, `max_jump` is 1**
