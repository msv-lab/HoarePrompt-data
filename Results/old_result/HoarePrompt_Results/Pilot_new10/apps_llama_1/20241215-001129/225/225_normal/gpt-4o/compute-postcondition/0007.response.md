Postcondition: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of capital English letters, with a length not exceeding 100, `vowels` is {'A', 'E', 'I', 'O', 'U', 'Y'}. If `s[i]` is in `vowels`, then `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is 0, and `i` is 0. If `s[i]` is not in `vowels`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged as there is no else part to modify them, so `max_jump` is 1, `prev_pos` is -1, and `i` is 0.**
