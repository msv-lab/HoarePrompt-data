Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it accurately implements the logic to find the minimum jump ability required by the Grasshopper to reach the end of the string, jumping only on vowels.

Here's a step-by-step explanation:

1. The function `func_1(s)` initializes a set of vowels and a `max_jump` variable to 1.
2. It then iterates over the string `s`. Whenever it encounters a vowel, it calculates the distance from the previous vowel (or the start of the string, if this is the first vowel) and updates `max_jump` if this distance is greater.
3. After iterating over the entire string, it calculates the distance from the last vowel to the end of the string and updates `max_jump` if necessary.
4. Finally, it returns `max_jump`, which represents the minimum jump ability required to reach the end of the string.

The program handles all potential cases correctly, including:

* Strings with only vowels
* Strings with only consonants (in which case `max_jump` will be equal to the length of the string plus one, but since we can't jump out of the string, it will simply be the length of the string)
* Strings with a mix of vowels and consonants
* Strings with consecutive vowels or consonants

The program also correctly handles edge cases, such as an empty string (although this is not a valid input according to the problem description) or a string with a single character.

Overall, the program accurately implements the logic required to solve the problem, and it correctly handles all potential cases and edge cases.
