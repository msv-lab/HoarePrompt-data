Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three input numbers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1, and prints 'YES' if it is, and 'NO' otherwise. However, this is not the correct condition to determine if it is possible to switch on the garlands such that each second after the switching on has at least one lit garland.

For example, consider the input `4 2 3`. The program will calculate the GCD of these numbers, which is 1, and print 'YES'. However, it is actually not possible to switch on the garlands such that each second after the switching on has at least one lit garland. This is because the garland with interval 4 will only be lit every 4 seconds, and the garlands with intervals 2 and 3 will not be able to cover the seconds in between.

The correct solution to this problem is more complex and involves checking all possible combinations of switching on the garlands and verifying if there are any seconds that do not have at least one lit garland. The provided program does not implement this correctly and therefore does not solve the problem as described. 

Here is a correct implementation of the problem in Python:
```python
def main():
    import sys
    k1, k2, k3 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    
    for t1 in range(max(k1, k2, k3) + 1):
        for t2 in range(max(k1, k2, k3) + 1):
            for t3 in range(max(k1, k2, k3) + 1):
                start_time = max(t1, t2, t3)
                valid = True
                for time in range(start_time, start_time + max(k1, k2, k3)):
                    if (time - t1) % k1 == 0 or (time - t2) % k2 == 0 or (time - t3) % k3 == 0:
                        continue
                    else:
                        valid = False
                        break
                if valid:
                    print("YES")
                    return
    print("NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```
