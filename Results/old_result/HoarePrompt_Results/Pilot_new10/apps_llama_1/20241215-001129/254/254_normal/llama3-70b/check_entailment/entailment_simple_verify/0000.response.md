The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect because it only checks if the least common multiple (LCM) of the three time intervals is a multiple of each of the intervals, which does not guarantee that there will be at least one lit garland during every second. However, upon closer examination of the annotated code, we can see that the function `func_1(a, b)` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm.

The LCM of two numbers `a` and `b` can be calculated as `lcm(a, b) = |a*b| / gcd(a, b)`. The program calculates the LCM of the three intervals as `lcm = k1 * k2 * k3 // (func_1(k1, k2) * func_1(k2, k3) * func_1(k1, k3))`, which is equivalent to calculating the LCM of `k1`, `k2`, and `k3`.

However, the correct approach to solve this problem involves checking all possible combinations of switch-on times and verifying if there is at least one lit garland during every second. The given program does not consider these combinations and therefore may produce incorrect results for certain inputs.

The annotated code does not change this fact, as it only provides more information about the state of the program at different points but does not change the underlying logic of the program. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**.
