You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mishka is decorating the Christmas tree. He has got three garlands, and all of them will be put on the tree. After that Mishka will switch these garlands on.

When a garland is switched on, it periodically changes its state — sometimes it is lit, sometimes not. Formally, if i-th garland is switched on during x-th second, then it is lit only during seconds x, x + k_{i}, x + 2k_{i}, x + 3k_{i} and so on.

Mishka wants to switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on there would be at least one lit garland. Formally, Mishka wants to choose three integers x_1, x_2 and x_3 (not necessarily distinct) so that he will switch on the first garland during x_1-th second, the second one — during x_2-th second, and the third one — during x_3-th second, respectively, and during each second starting from max(x_1, x_2, x_3) at least one garland will be lit.

Help Mishka by telling him if it is possible to do this!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers k_1, k_2 and k_3 (1 ≤ k_{i} ≤ 1500) — time intervals of the garlands.


-----Output-----

If Mishka can choose moments of time to switch on the garlands in such a way that each second after switching the garlands on at least one garland will be lit, print YES.

Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2 3

Output
YES

Input
4 2 3

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example Mishka can choose x_1 = 1, x_2 = 2, x_3 = 1. The first garland will be lit during seconds 1, 3, 5, 7, ..., the second — 2, 4, 6, 8, ..., which already cover all the seconds after the 2-nd one. It doesn't even matter what x_3 is chosen. Our choice will lead third to be lit during seconds 1, 4, 7, 10, ..., though.

In the second example there is no way to choose such moments of time, there always be some seconds when no garland is lit.
Program:
```
import math

def func():
    (k1, k2, k3) = map(int, input().split())
    gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)
    gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)
    if gcd_all == 1:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem. It only checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three input numbers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1, and prints 'YES' if it is, and 'NO' otherwise. However, this is not the correct condition to determine if it is possible to switch on the garlands such that each second after the switching on has at least one lit garland.

For example, consider the input `4 2 3`. The program will calculate the GCD of these numbers, which is 1, and print 'YES'. However, it is actually not possible to switch on the garlands such that each second after the switching on has at least one lit garland. This is because the garland with interval 4 will only be lit every 4 seconds, and the garlands with intervals 2 and 3 will not be able to cover the seconds in between.

The correct solution to this problem is more complex and involves checking all possible combinations of switching on the garlands and verifying if there are any seconds that do not have at least one lit garland. The provided program does not implement this correctly and therefore does not solve the problem as described. 

Here is a correct implementation of the problem in Python:
```python
def main():
    import sys
    k1, k2, k3 = map(int, sys.stdin.readline().split())
    
    for t1 in range(max(k1, k2, k3) + 1):
        for t2 in range(max(k1, k2, k3) + 1):
            for t3 in range(max(k1, k2, k3) + 1):
                start_time = max(t1, t2, t3)
                valid = True
                for time in range(start_time, start_time + max(k1, k2, k3)):
                    if (time - t1) % k1 == 0 or (time - t2) % k2 == 0 or (time - t3) % k3 == 0:
                        continue
                    else:
                        valid = False
                        break
                if valid:
                    print("YES")
                    return
    print("NO")

if __name__ == "__main__":
    main()
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: There are three integers, k1, k2, and k3, representing the time intervals of the garlands, such that 1 <= ki <= 1500 for i = 1, 2, 3.
def func():
    k1, k2, k3 = map(int, input().split())
    gcd_k1_k2 = math.gcd(k1, k2)
    gcd_all = math.gcd(gcd_k1_k2, k3)
    if (gcd_all == 1) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `k1` is an input integer, `k2` is an input integer, `k3` is an input integer, 1 <= `k1` <= 1500, 1 <= `k2` <= 1500, 1 <= `k3` <= 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`, if `gcd_all` is 1, 'YES' has been printed, otherwise 'NO' has been printed to the output.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads three integers from input, checks if they are coprime, and prints 'YES' if their greatest common divisor is 1, and 'NO' otherwise, but may fail with an error if the input is not as expected

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
