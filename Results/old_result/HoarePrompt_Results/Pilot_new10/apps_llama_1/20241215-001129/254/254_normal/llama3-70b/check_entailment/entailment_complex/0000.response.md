Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem description requires that Mishka can switch on the garlands in such a way that during each second after switching the garlands on, there would be at least one lit garland. However, the given program only calculates the least common multiple (LCM) of the three garlands' intervals and checks if it is divisible by each interval. 

This approach is incorrect because it does not consider the actual switching times of the garlands. The program should check if there exists a combination of switching times for the three garlands such that at least one garland is lit in every second after the maximum switching time. 

A correct approach would be to try different switching times for the garlands and check if the condition is met. The given program does not perform this check and therefore does not guarantee that the condition specified in the problem description is met. 

For example, if the input is 4, 2, 3, the program calculates the LCM as 12 and since 12 is not divisible by 4, it prints NO. However, this does not necessarily mean that it is impossible to switch on the garlands such that at least one is lit in every second. The program should check all possible switching times to determine if this is possible. 

In the given examples, the program may produce the correct output by coincidence, but it does not follow the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
