The original assessment states that the provided Python program does not correctly solve the problem. The assessment claims that the program only checks if the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the three input numbers `k1`, `k2`, and `k3` is 1, and prints 'YES' if it is, and 'NO' otherwise. This is indeed what the program does. However, the assessment also provides a counterexample where the program returns 'YES' for the input `4 2 3`, but it is actually not possible to switch on the garlands such that each second after the switching on has at least one lit garland.

However, the provided counterexample in the original assessment is incorrect. The claim is that the garland with interval 4 will only be lit every 4 seconds, and the garlands with intervals 2 and 3 will not be able to cover the seconds in between. But the problem statement does not specify that the garlands must be switched on at time 0. It only requires that there exists some time after which at least one garland is lit every second.

The annotated version of the code does not provide any additional information that would suggest the program is incorrect. It accurately describes the state of the program at different points.

In fact, the program is correct. The key insight is that if the GCD of the three numbers is 1, then there exists some time after which at least one garland is lit every second. This is because the GCD being 1 means that the three numbers are coprime, and therefore there exists some time after which the three garlands will cover every second.

For example, consider the input `4 2 3`. The GCD of these numbers is 1, which means that the program will correctly print 'YES'. And indeed, it is possible to switch on the garlands such that each second after the switching on has at least one lit garland. For instance, switching on the garland with interval 4 at time 1, the garland with interval 2 at time 2, and the garland with interval 3 at time 3 will cover every second after time 3.

Therefore, the original assessment is incorrect.

Final: **True**
