To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's examine the condition of the `while` loop, which is `while b:`. This means the loop will continue to execute as long as `b` is true or, in the context of integers, not equal to 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `b` is 0. For the loop to execute again, `b` must be adjusted so that it is not 0. The values of `k1`, `k2`, `k3`, and `a` do not affect the loop condition directly, so they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to potentially execute one more time.

State: **`k1`, `k2`, and `k3` are integers such that 1 ≤ `k1`, `k2`, `k3` ≤ 1500; `a` is 1; `b` is not 0**
