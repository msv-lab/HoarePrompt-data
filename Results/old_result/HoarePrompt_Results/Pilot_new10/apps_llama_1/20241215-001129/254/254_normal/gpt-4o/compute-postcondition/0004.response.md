The given code snippet is a simple print statement that prints 'YES'. This statement does not modify any variables. 

The initial state is: `k1` is an input integer, `k2` is an input integer, `k3` is an input integer, 1 <= `k1` <= 1500, 1 <= `k2` <= 1500, 1 <= `k3` <= 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`, and the current value of `gcd_all` is 1.

Since the print statement does not change the values of any variables, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the additional fact that 'YES' has been printed.

Output State: **`k1` is an input integer, `k2` is an input integer, `k3` is an input integer, 1 <= `k1` <= 1500, 1 <= `k2` <= 1500, 1 <= `k3` <= 1500, `gcd_k1_k2` is the greatest common divisor of `k1` and `k2`, `gcd_all` is the greatest common divisor of `gcd_k1_k2` and `k3`, `gcd_all` is 1, and 'YES' has been printed**
