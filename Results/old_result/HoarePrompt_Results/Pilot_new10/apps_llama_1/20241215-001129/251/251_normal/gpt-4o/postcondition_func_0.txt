The function calculates the maximum stackable volume of cakes given their dimensions, where each cake must be smaller in volume than the one it is stacked on, and returns this maximum volume. It handles cases where no cakes can be stacked and returns 0 if there are no cakes. However, it does not explicitly validate input for positive integers or handle cases where input dimensions are negative or lead to non-integer volumes.
