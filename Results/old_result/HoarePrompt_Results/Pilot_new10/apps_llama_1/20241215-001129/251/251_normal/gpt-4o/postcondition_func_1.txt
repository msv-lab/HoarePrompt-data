The function accepts input from the user, processes it into a number `n` and a list of cake dimensions `cakes`, passes this data to `func_1` for calculation, and prints the result with six decimal places, without explicit input validation for positivity or integer constraints, and without showing the implementation of `func_1` which performs the actual calculation based on cake dimensions.
