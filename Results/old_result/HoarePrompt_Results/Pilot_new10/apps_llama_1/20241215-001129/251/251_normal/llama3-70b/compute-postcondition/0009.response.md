The values of `r` and `h` are updated to the input integers. The other variables are not affected, so `n` is still a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is still a list containing two tuples with the original values (as the values of `r` and `h` were used to calculate the volume, and these new `r` and `h` will not change the original `cakes`), and `_` is still 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `cakes` is a list containing two tuples: the original tuple `(math.pi * previous_r * previous_r * previous_h, previous_r, previous_h)` and the new tuple `(math.pi * previous_r * previous_r * previous_h, previous_r, previous_h)`, `r` is an input integer, `h` is an input integer, `_` is 1**
