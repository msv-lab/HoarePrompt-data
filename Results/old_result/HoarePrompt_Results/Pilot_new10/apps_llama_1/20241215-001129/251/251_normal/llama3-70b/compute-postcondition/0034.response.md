According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and `i`. If `j` is less than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 0 and `i` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1. So, `j` becomes 1. All other conditions remain the same. 

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 0, `cakes` is a list of at least `n+1` tuples, `j` is 1. If `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp` is a list where `dp[i]` equals `max(cakes[n][0], dp[0] + cakes[i][0])`. Otherwise, `dp` remains unchanged, still where `dp[i]` equals `cakes[n][0]`.**
