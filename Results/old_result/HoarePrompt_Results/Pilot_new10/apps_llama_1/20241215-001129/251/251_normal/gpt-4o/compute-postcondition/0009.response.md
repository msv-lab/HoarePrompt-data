`dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. The value of `n` is still greater than 0, `i` is still greater than 1, and `cakes` is still a list of tuples with at least one tuple. The list `volumes` is still a list of `n` positive floating-point numbers with at least one volume. The list `dp` is updated at index `i` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. The other values in `dp` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `i` is greater than 1, `cakes` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `volumes` is a list of `n` positive floating-point numbers with at least one volume, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[0]` is equal to `volumes[0]` and `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`**
