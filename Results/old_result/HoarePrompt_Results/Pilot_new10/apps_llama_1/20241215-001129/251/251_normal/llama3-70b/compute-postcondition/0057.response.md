The function `func` accepts a list of cake dimensions and the total number of cakes as input, where each cake is represented by a pair of positive integers, the radius and height of the cake. The function calculates the volume of each cake as `(math.pi * r * r * h)` and stores this along with the radius and height in a list of tuples, `cakes`. 

After sorting the `cakes` list in descending order by volume, the function then iterates through the list to calculate the maximum volume that can be achieved by stacking cakes, with the condition that a cake can only be stacked on top of another cake if its radius and height are both less than those of the cake it is being stacked on.

The function then prints the maximum volume of cakes that can be stacked, considering the conditions mentioned above.

Looking at the code line by line, it appears that the code correctly calculates the volume of each cake and sorts the list in descending order by volume. However, there are some edge cases that need to be considered. 

For instance, the function does not check if the input number of cakes, `n`, is a positive integer. If `n` is not a positive integer, the function may not work as expected. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input pairs of radius and height are not positive integers.

Furthermore, the function assumes that the input pairs of radius and height are valid and can be used to calculate the volume of the cake. However, if the input pairs are not valid (e.g., if the radius or height is negative), the function may produce incorrect results.

In terms of missing logic, the function does not consider cases where two or more cakes have the same radius and height. In such cases, the function may not correctly calculate the maximum volume of cakes that can be stacked.

Considering all these potential edge cases and missing functionality, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of cake dimensions and the total number of cakes, calculates the volume of each cake, sorts the cakes in descending order by volume, and then calculates the maximum volume of cakes that can be stacked, considering the condition that a cake can only be stacked on top of another cake if its radius and height are both less than those of the cake it is being stacked on, and prints this maximum volume, although it may not handle invalid inputs, such as non-positive integers for the number of cakes, non-positive integers for the radius and height of a cake, or cakes with the same radius and height. **
