The value of `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + volumes[i]`. Since `j` is 0 and `i` is at least 1, and the volume at index `j` (which is 0) is greater than the volume at index `i`, `dp[j]` is `dp[0]`. The new value of `dp[i]` is `max(dp[i], dp[0] + volumes[i])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 1, `cakes` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `volumes` is a list of `n` positive floating-point numbers, `dp` is a list of `n` values where `dp[i]` is `max(dp[i], dp[0] + volumes[i])`, and `j` is 0**
