Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` equals `n-1`, `cakes` is a list of at least `n+1` tuples, `j` is 0, if `cakes[i][1]` is less than `cakes[j][1]` and `cakes[i][2]` is less than `cakes[j][2]`, then `dp[n-1]` equals `max(cakes[n-1][0], dp[0] + cakes[n-1][0])`, otherwise `dp[n-1]` remains `cakes[n-1][0]`.**
