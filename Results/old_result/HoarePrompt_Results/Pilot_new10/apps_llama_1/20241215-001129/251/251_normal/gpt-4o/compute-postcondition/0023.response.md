Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is at least 2, `cakes` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `volumes` is a list of `n` positive floating-point numbers, `j` is 1. If `volumes[j]` is less than `volumes[i]`, then `dp[i]` is the maximum of its previous value and `dp[1] + volumes[i]`.***
