#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, cakes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake, and the length of cakes is equal to n.
def func_1(n, cakes):
    volumes = [(math.pi * r * r * h) for r, h in cakes]
    dp = [0] * n
    for i in range(n):
        dp[i] = volumes[i]
        
        for j in range(i):
            if volumes[j] < volumes[i]:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + volumes[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `cakes` is a list of tuples, `volumes` is a list of `n` positive floating-point numbers, and `dp` is a list of `n` values where each `dp[i]` represents the maximum volume that can be stacked using the first `i+1` volumes under the condition that each volume must be smaller than the one it is stacked on. If `n` is 0, `dp` is a list of zeros.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum volume that can be stacked using the volumes in the list `volumes` under the condition that each volume must be smaller than the one it is stacked on, which is the maximum value in the list `dp`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates the maximum stackable volume of cakes given their dimensions, where each cake must be smaller in volume than the one it is stacked on, and returns this maximum volume. It handles cases where no cakes can be stacked and returns 0 if there are no cakes. However, it does not explicitly validate input for positive integers or handle cases where input dimensions are negative or lead to non-integer volumes.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, cakes is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the radius and height of a cake.
def func_2():
    data = input().split()
    n = int(data[0])
    cakes = [(int(data[2 * i + 1]), int(data[2 * i + 2])) for i in range(n)]
    result = func_1(n, cakes)
    print(f'{result:.6f}')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts input from the user, processes it into a number `n` and a list of cake dimensions `cakes`, passes this data to `func_1` for calculation, and prints the result with six decimal places, without explicit input validation for positivity or integer constraints, and without showing the implementation of `func_1` which performs the actual calculation based on cake dimensions.
