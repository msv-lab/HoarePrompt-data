To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the initial state.

Given loop:
```python
for j in range(i):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

Initial state:
- `n` is greater than 1
- `i` equals `n-1`
- `cakes` is a list of at least `n+1` tuples
- `j` equals `n-2`
- `dp[n-1]` equals `cakes[n-1][0]`

The loop will execute if `i` is greater than 0 because the `range(i)` function generates numbers from 0 up to but not including `i`. Since `i` equals `n-1` and `n` is greater than 1, `i` is indeed greater than 0, satisfying the condition for the loop to execute.

However, for the loop to start executing, `j` needs to be set to the first value in the range, which is 0, not `n-2`. The state of `j` before the loop is not relevant to the loop's execution because `j` is the loop variable and will be overwritten by the loop.

The state of `cakes` and `dp[n-1]` does not directly affect the loop's ability to start executing but is part of the overall program state.

Thus, the adjusted state for the loop to execute is:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` equals `n-1`, `cakes` is a list of at least `n+1` tuples, `j` is 0, `dp[n-1]` equals `cakes[n-1][0]`**
