Postcondition: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` equals `n-1`, `cakes` is a list of at least `n+1` tuples, `j` is 0, `dp[n-1]` equals `cakes[n-1][0]`. The current value of `i` and `j` are such that the first tuple element of `cakes` at index `i` is less than the first tuple element of `cakes` at index `j`, and the second tuple element of `cakes` at index `i` is less than the second tuple element of `cakes` at index `j`, and the third tuple element of `cakes` at index `i` is less than the third tuple element of `cakes` at index `j`.**
