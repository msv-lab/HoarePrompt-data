Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer that must be at least 3, `x` is an input integer, `a` is 2, `b` is `s - 2`. If the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b` equals `x`, then `count` is either 1 or 2; if the bitwise XOR of 2 and `s - 1` equals `x`, then the initial `count` was 1, otherwise the initial `count` was 0. If the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b` does not equal `x`, then the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `count` being either 0 or 1, where if the bitwise XOR of 2 and `s - 1` equals `x`, then `count` is 1, otherwise `count` is 0.***
