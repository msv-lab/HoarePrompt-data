Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

The problem description asks for the number of possible values for the ordered pair (a, b) given that two positive integers a and b have a sum of s and a bitwise XOR of x. 

However, the provided program attempts to calculate the values of a and b using the bitwise XOR operation. The lines `a = b ^ x` and `b = a ^ x` are attempting to calculate a and b, but they are doing so in a circular manner, and they do not take into account the sum of a and b, which is a crucial part of the problem.

Moreover, the program does not handle the case where a or b might not be positive integers, which is another crucial constraint mentioned in the problem description.

To correctly solve this problem, we would need to find all possible combinations of positive integers a and b such that a + b = s and a ^ b = x, and then count the number of such combinations.

Here's an example of a correct solution in Python:

```python
def func(s, x):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, s):
        b = s - a
        if a > 0 and b > 0 and a ^ b == x:
            count += 1
    return count

s, x = map(int, input().split())
print(func(s, x))
```
This solution iterates over all possible values of a and checks if the corresponding value of b (calculated as s - a) satisfies the conditions of the problem. If it does, it increments the count. Finally, it returns the count. 

Note that this is just one possible solution, and there may be other correct solutions that achieve the same result in a different way.
