Postcondition: **`s` is an input integer that must be at least 4, `x` is an input integer, `a` is 3, `b` is `s - 3`. If the bitwise XOR of `a` (3) and `b` (`s - 3`) equals `x`, then `count` is either 1, 2, or 3. If the bitwise XOR of `a` (3) and `b` (`s - 3`) does not equal `x`, then the state of `count` remains unchanged as no alternative condition is specified.**
