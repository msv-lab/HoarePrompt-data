The function `func` doesn't have any parameters defined in the given code. 

However, based on the provided parameter constraints, it seems like the function is supposed to accept two parameters, `s` and `x`, where `s` is an integer such that 2 ≤ s ≤ 10^12 and `x` is an integer such that 0 ≤ x ≤ 10^12. 

Since there's no information provided about the output or return value, we can't determine the exact functionality of the function. 

However, if we were to assume that the function is supposed to operate on these constraints, then the functionality can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, s and x, where s and x are integers within the given constraints, but the return value is undefined.**
