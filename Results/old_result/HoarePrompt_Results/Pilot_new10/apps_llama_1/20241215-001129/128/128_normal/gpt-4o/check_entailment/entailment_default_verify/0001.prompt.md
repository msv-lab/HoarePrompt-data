You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Summer holidays! Someone is going on trips, someone is visiting grandparents, but someone is trying to get a part-time job. This summer Noora decided that she wants to earn some money, and took a job in a shop as an assistant.

Shop, where Noora is working, has a plan on the following n days. For each day sales manager knows exactly, that in i-th day k_{i} products will be put up for sale and exactly l_{i} clients will come to the shop that day. Also, the manager is sure, that everyone, who comes to the shop, buys exactly one product or, if there aren't any left, leaves the shop without buying anything. Moreover, due to the short shelf-life of the products, manager established the following rule: if some part of the products left on the shelves at the end of the day, that products aren't kept on the next day and are sent to the dump.

For advertising purposes manager offered to start a sell-out in the shop. He asked Noora to choose any f days from n next for sell-outs. On each of f chosen days the number of products were put up for sale would be doubled. Thus, if on i-th day shop planned to put up for sale k_{i} products and Noora has chosen this day for sell-out, shelves of the shop would keep 2·k_{i} products. Consequently, there is an opportunity to sell two times more products on days of sell-out.

Noora's task is to choose f days to maximize total number of sold products. She asks you to help her with such a difficult problem.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and f (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5, 0 ≤ f ≤ n) denoting the number of days in shop's plan and the number of days that Noora has to choose for sell-out.

Each line of the following n subsequent lines contains two integers k_{i}, l_{i} (0 ≤ k_{i}, l_{i} ≤ 10^9) denoting the number of products on the shelves of the shop on the i-th day and the number of clients that will come to the shop on i-th day.


-----Output-----

Print a single integer denoting the maximal number of products that shop can sell.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
2 1
3 5
2 3
1 5

Output
10
Input
4 1
0 2
0 3
3 5
0 6

Output
5


-----Note-----

In the first example we can choose days with numbers 2 and 4 for sell-out. In this case new numbers of products for sale would be equal to [2, 6, 2, 2] respectively. So on the first day shop will sell 1 product, on the second — 5, on the third — 2, on the fourth — 2. In total 1 + 5 + 2 + 2 = 10 product units.

In the second example it is possible to sell 5 products, if you choose third day for sell-out.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
f = int(data[1])
days = [(int(data[2 + 2 * i]), int(data[3 + 2 * i])) for i in range(n)]
result = func_1(n, f, days)
print(result)

def func_1(n, f, days):
    regular_sales = []
    potential_sales_increase = []
    for (k, l) in days:
        regular_sales.append(min(k, l))
        potential_sales_increase.append(min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l))
    total_sales = sum(regular_sales)
    potential_sales_increase.sort(reverse=True)
    total_sales += sum(potential_sales_increase[:f])
    return total_sales


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program appears to be correct based on the problem description. It calculates the maximum number of products that can be sold by choosing the optimal days for sell-out.

Here's a breakdown of the program's logic:

1. It calculates the regular sales for each day by taking the minimum of the products available and the clients coming.
2. It then calculates the potential sales increase for each day by comparing the sales if the products were doubled (min(2*k, l)) with the regular sales (min(k, l)).
3. The potential sales increases are sorted in descending order to prioritize the days with the highest potential increase.
4. Finally, it adds the potential sales increases for the top 'f' days to the total regular sales to get the maximum number of products that can be sold.

The program handles all the edge cases mentioned in the problem description, including:

* When f is 0, it only calculates the regular sales.
* When f is equal to n, it doubles the products for all days and calculates the maximum sales.
* When k or l is 0, it correctly calculates the sales as 0.

The program also correctly handles the case when the number of clients is less than the number of products, as well as when the number of clients is greater than the number of products.

Overall, the program seems to be correct based on the problem description, and it handles all the potential cases correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts parameters n, f, and days, and returns the sum of the minimum sales from each day plus the sum of the f largest potential sales increases, handling cases where n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n, and days is a list of n pairs of non-negative integers, but may behave unexpectedly for invalid input values. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
