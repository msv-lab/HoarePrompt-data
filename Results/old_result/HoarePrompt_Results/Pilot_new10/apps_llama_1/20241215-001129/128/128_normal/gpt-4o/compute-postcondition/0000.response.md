The code initializes an empty list `regular_sales`. This operation does not affect the values of `n`, `f`, or `days`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of `n` pairs of non-negative integers, and `regular_sales` is an empty list**
