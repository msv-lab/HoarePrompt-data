The function accepts parameters n, f, and days, and returns the sum of the minimum sales from each day plus the sum of the f largest potential sales increases, handling cases where n is a positive integer, f is a non-negative integer less than or equal to n, and days is a list of n pairs of non-negative integers, but may behave unexpectedly for invalid input values.
