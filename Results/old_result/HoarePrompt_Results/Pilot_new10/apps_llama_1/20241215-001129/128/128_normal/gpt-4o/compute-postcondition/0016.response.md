The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `f`, and `days`. `n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, and `days` is a list of `n` pairs of non-negative integers. Each pair in `days` represents the number of products and the number of clients on a particular day. After executing the function body, the function returns the sum of the minimum sales from each day plus the sum of the `f` largest potential sales increases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, f, and days, and returns the sum of the minimum sales from each day plus the sum of the f largest potential sales increases.**
