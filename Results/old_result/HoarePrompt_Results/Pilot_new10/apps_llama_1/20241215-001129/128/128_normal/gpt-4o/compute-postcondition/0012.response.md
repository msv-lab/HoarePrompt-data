`total_sales` is assigned the value of the sum of `regular_sales`. The value of `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of each pair of values from `days`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `f` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `f` <= `n`, `days` is a list of `n` pairs of non-negative integers, `regular_sales` is a list containing the minimum of each pair of values from `days`, `potential_sales_increase` is a list containing the corresponding potential sales increases for each pair, calculated as `min(2 * k, l) - min(k, l)` for each pair `k` and `l` in `days`, and `total_sales` is the sum of `regular_sales`**
