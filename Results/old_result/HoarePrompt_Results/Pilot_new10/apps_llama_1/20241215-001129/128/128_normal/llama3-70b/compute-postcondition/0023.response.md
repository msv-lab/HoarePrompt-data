Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer in the range [1, 10^5], `f` is an integer in the range [0, `n`], there are `n` lists each containing two integers `k_i` and `l_i`, `days` is a sorted list of `n` tuples in descending order by `x[1] - x[0]`, `i` is an integer with a value that must be less than `n`. If `i` is less than `f`, then `sold` is equal to its previous value plus `min(days[i][0] * 2, days[i][1])`. Otherwise, `sold` is equal to its previous value plus `min(days[i][0], days[i][1])`.***
