Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. The problem description requires finding a sequence of fractions that sums up to $1 - \frac{1}{n}$, where each fraction has a denominator that divides $n$ and is between $1$ and $n$. 

However, the program always prints `1/2` and `1/n` as the fractions, which may not satisfy the condition. For example, when $n = 5$, the program will print `1/2` and `1/5`, but these fractions do not sum up to $1 - \frac{1}{5} = \frac{4}{5}$. 

Furthermore, the program does not check whether the fractions `1/n/2` and `1/n` have denominators that divide `n`, which is a requirement specified in the problem description.

The correct solution needs to find the actual sequence of fractions that satisfies the conditions, not just print a fixed pattern of fractions. The program should find the factors of `n`, generate the fractions, and then check whether the sum of these fractions equals $1 - \frac{1}{n}$. If the program doesn't do this for every potential case, then it's incorrect.

To fix the program, you would need to generate all possible combinations of fractions with denominators that divide `n` and check which combinations sum up to $1 - \frac{1}{n}$. 

An example of an incorrect output of the program can be shown with the input:
```
5
```
The program's output will be:
```
YES
2
1 2
1 5
```
However, `1/2 + 1/5 = 7/10`, not `1 - 1/5 = 4/5`. Therefore, the program does not produce the correct output for this input. 

This indicates that the given program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description and thus is **False**.
