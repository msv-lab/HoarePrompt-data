The code prints the string '1' and the value of `n`. The previous printed values are not affected, and the values of the variables `n` and `k` are also unchanged. The new output is '1' and the value of `n`, in addition to the previous outputs: 'YES', 2, '1', and `n // 2`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is 2, 'YES', 2, '1', `n // 2`, '1', and `n` have been printed**
