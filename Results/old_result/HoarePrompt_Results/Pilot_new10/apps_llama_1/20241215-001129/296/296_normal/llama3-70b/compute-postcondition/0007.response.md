The code prints '1' and the integer division of `n` by 2. The previous values of the variables are: `n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 2, 'YES' and 2 have been printed, `k` is 2. The states of the variables `n` and `k` are not affected by the print statement. 
The value of `n // 2` depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is an input integer and `n` is not equal to 2, `n // 2` can be any integer except 1. 
The output of the print statement will be '1' and the integer division of `n` by 2. 
Additionally, 'YES', 2, '1', and `n // 2` have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `n` is not equal to 2, `k` is 2, 'YES', 2, '1', and `n // 2` have been printed**
