The value of `i` is appended to the list `divisors`. The initial values of `n` and `i` are: `n` is an integer such that 16 <= `n` <= 10^9, and `i` is 4. Since `i` is appended to `divisors`, the list `divisors` now contains the value 4. The state of `n` is not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 16 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is 4, `divisors` is a list containing the value 4**
