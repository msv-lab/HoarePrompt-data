Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 9 <= `n` <= 10^9, `i` is 3. If `i` is not equal to `n // i`, then `divisors` is a list containing the integers 3 and `n // 3`. Since the condition `i!= n // i` is the only condition given and there's no else part, we consider all scenarios where this condition may or may not hold. Given `i` is 3, if `n` is a multiple of 3 (and given `n` is between 9 and 10^9), `n // 3` will also be an integer. If `n` is exactly 9, then `n // 3` equals 3, which means `i` equals `n // i`, but this case does not meet the condition `i!= n // i`. For all other valid `n` values where `n` is greater than 9 and a multiple of 3, or not a multiple of 3, the condition `i!= n // i` will either hold or not, but since there's no else clause provided, the postcondition focuses on the scenario where `i!= n // i`, resulting in `divisors` being updated to include `n // 3`.***
