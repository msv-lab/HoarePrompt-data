The function accepts a positive integer n between 2 and 10^9 and returns either 'NO' if n is less than or equal to 2 or if n is a prime number, or a string that starts with 'YES', followed by the number of divisors of n that are less than or equal to the square root of n, and then lists each of these divisors in the format '1 d', where d is a divisor of n and is less than or equal to the square root of n, but may include duplicate divisors if n is a perfect square.
