Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case. 

The main issue with the code lies in the way it constructs the sequence of fractions. The code simply outputs two fractions, `1/(n // 2)` and `1/n`, but these fractions do not necessarily sum up to `1 - 1/n` as required by the problem.

For instance, consider the case when `n = 6`. According to the problem description, the output should be:
```
YES
2
1 2
1 3
```
However, the provided code will output:
```
YES
2
1 3
1 6
```
Which is incorrect because `1/3 + 1/6` does not equal `1 - 1/6`.

Another issue is that the code does not check whether `n // 2` divides `n` and whether `1 < n // 2 < n`, which are conditions required by the problem.

In general, the code does not have a correct logic to find the sequence of fractions that satisfy the given conditions, and it does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. 

To fix the code, a correct approach would involve finding a way to construct a sequence of fractions that sum up to `1 - 1/n` and meet all the conditions specified in the problem description. This would likely involve a more complex algorithm that takes into account the factors of `n` and the relationships between the fractions.
