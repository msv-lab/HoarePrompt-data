Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. The problem requires finding a sequence of fractions where the sum of these fractions equals `1 - 1/n`. However, the provided program simply lists all the divisors of `n` less than or equal to the square root of `n` as fractions with a numerator of 1, which does not guarantee that the sum of these fractions will equal `1 - 1/n`.

For example, if `n = 6`, the program correctly outputs `YES` followed by the fractions `1 2` and `1 3`, which sum to `1 - 1/6`. However, if `n = 4`, the program will output `YES` followed by the fraction `1 2`, which does not sum to `1 - 1/4 = 3/4` (it sums to `1/2`).

The problem description requires a more complex algorithm to find the correct sequence of fractions, taking into account the target sum `1 - 1/n` and ensuring that each denominator `b_i` divides `n`, `1 < b_i < n`, and each numerator `a_i` satisfies `1 <= a_i < b_i`. The provided program does not meet these requirements in all cases. 

A correct program would need to assess the divisors of `n` and determine a combination of fractions with those divisors as denominators that sum up to `1 - 1/n`, adhering to the constraints specified in the problem description. The current implementation does not achieve this for all possible values of `n`.
