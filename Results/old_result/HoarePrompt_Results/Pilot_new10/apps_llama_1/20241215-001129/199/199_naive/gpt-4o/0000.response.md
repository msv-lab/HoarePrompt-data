Correctness: **True**.

The program is correct because it follows the problem description and handles all possible cases. It correctly counts the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but is impossible to form a square.

The function `func_1(n)` checks all possible values of `a` (which is one of the side lengths of the rectangle) and calculates the corresponding value of `b` (which is the other side length). It then calculates the remaining length `rem` and checks if it can be divided into two equal parts. If `rem` is not equal to `a` (which means it's not possible to form a square), it increments the count.

The program handles the edge case where `n` is less than 6 correctly, returning 0 as expected. It also handles the case where `a` is greater than `n // 4` correctly, since it will not enter the loop in this case.

All examples provided in the problem description work correctly with this program, and no counterexamples could be found. Therefore, the program is correct.
