Postcondition: **`n` is greater than or equal to 6, `rem` is `n - 4`, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, and if `rem` is greater than 0 and an even number, then if `a` is not equal to half of the current value of `rem`, `count` is 1, otherwise `count` remains 0, otherwise no changes are made to `count` because `rem` is either less than or equal to 0 or an odd number.**
