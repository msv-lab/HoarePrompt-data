To assess the correctness of the program, let's break down the problem description and compare it with what the code does.

The problem asks for the number of ways to split a stick of length `n` into four parts such that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but impossible to form a square. 

The code implements a function `func_1(n)` that iterates over possible values of `a` (one of the sides of the rectangle) from 1 to `n // 4`. For each `a`, it calculates the remaining length `rem` after subtracting `2 * (a + b)` from `n`, where `b` is initially set to `a`. It checks if `rem` is positive and even, and if `a` is not equal to `rem // 2`, then it increments the count.

However, upon closer inspection, the condition `b = a` seems incorrect as it limits the flexibility in choosing sides of the rectangle. The problem description implies that the sides of the rectangle can be any combination of four parts that do not form a square, not just when two sides are identical.

The annotated version of the code clarifies the state of the program at different points but does not change the logic. It confirms that the program checks for conditions under the assumption that `b = a`, which seems to be a restrictive interpretation of the problem.

Therefore, the original assessment of the program being correct does not align with a thorough understanding of the problem description. The code does not fully explore all combinations that could form a rectangle but not a square because it assumes `b = a` initially.

Final: **False** 

The reason for this assessment is that the program's implementation does not align with the full requirements of the problem description due to the restrictive assumption about the sides of the rectangle.
