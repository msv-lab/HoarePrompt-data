The code increments the value of `count` by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `rem` is `n - 8`, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, and `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 8, `rem` is `n - 8`, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, and `count` is increased by 1**
