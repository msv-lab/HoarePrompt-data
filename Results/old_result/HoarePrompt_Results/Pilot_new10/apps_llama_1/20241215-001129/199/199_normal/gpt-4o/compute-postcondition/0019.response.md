The value of `b` is updated to be equal to the value of `a`. The previous value of `b` was 2, but it is now overwritten by the value of `a`, which is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 8, `rem` is `n - 8`, `a` is 3, `b` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 8, `rem` is `n - 8`, `a` is 3, `b` is 3**
