Since `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, and 2 times the sum of the current values of `a` and `b` equals `n`, we can calculate `n` as follows: 
2 * (`a` + `b`) = `n` 
2 * (2 + 2) = `n` 
2 * 4 = `n` 
8 = `n` 

However, `n` is greater than or equal to 5 and we have `n` equals 8. Also the current value of `a` is not equal to the current value of `b` is not correct as per the initial values of `a` and `b`. 

Given `ways` value is to be determined based on `n` and `a` and now we have `ways += 1`, so the new value of `ways` will be the old value of `ways` plus 1.

Output State: **`n` is 8, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, the current value of `a` is equal to the current value of `b`, and `ways` is the old value of `ways` plus 1**
