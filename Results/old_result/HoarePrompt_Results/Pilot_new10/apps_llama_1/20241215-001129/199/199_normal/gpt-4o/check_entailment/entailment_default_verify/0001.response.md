Based on the problem description, the provided code, and the output hints, I believe the original assessment is not accurate. Here's why:

The code only checks for the case where two pairs of equal-length parts are formed, and the remaining length is also split into two equal parts. However, this is not the only way to form a rectangle using four parts. The code does not consider the case where two different lengths are used to form the rectangle.

For example, if `n = 8`, the code will only consider the cases where `a = 1` and `rem = 4` (since `n - 4*a = 4`), or `a = 2` and `rem = 0` (since `n - 4*a = 0`), but it will not consider the case where `a = 1`, `b = 3`, `c = 1`, and `d = 3`, which also forms a rectangle.

The output hints suggest that the function only counts the number of integers `a` where `n - 4*a > 0`, `n - 4*a` is even, and `a` is not equal to `(n - 4*a) // 2`. However, this does not cover all possible cases of forming a rectangle using four parts.

Therefore, I believe the program is incorrect because it does not consider all possible cases of forming a rectangle using four parts.

Final: **False**
