The code increments the value of `ways` by 1. The initial value of `ways` is 0, so the new value of `ways` is 1. The values of `n`, `a`, and `b` are not affected by the code. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` + `b` = `n` / 2, `ways` is 1**
