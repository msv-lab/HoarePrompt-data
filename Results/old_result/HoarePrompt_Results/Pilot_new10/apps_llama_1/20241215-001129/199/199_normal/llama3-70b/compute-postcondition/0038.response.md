To determine the output state, let's analyze the given information and the return statement.

Given that `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, and `ways` is the number of pairs of distinct positive integers `(a, b)` where:
- `a` is in the range from 1 to `n // 2`, 
- `b` is in the range from `a` to `(n - a) // 2`, 
- `2 * (a + b) == n`.

The return statement simply returns the value of `ways`.

Therefore, the program returns the count of pairs `(a, b)` that satisfy the given conditions for a specific `n`.

Output State: **The program returns the number of pairs of distinct positive integers (a, b) where a is from 1 to n//2, b is from a to (n-a)//2, and 2*(a+b) equals n, for a given positive integer n greater than or equal to 4.**
