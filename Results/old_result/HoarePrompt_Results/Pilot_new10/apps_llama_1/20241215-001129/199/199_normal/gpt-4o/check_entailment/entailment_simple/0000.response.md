Correctness: **False**

The program does not always do what the problem description says. 

In the program, the loop only iterates over possible values of `a` and sets `b` equal to `a`. This means that the program only considers cases where two parts have length `a`, one part has length `b` (which is equal to `a`), and the last part has length `n - 2 * (a + b)`. 

However, according to the problem description, there should be four parts in total. Therefore, the program should consider all possible combinations of two pairs of equal lengths. 

The current implementation only considers cases where two parts have length `a` and the other two parts have lengths `b` and `n - 2 * (a + b)`, where `b = a`. It does not consider cases where two parts have length `a` and the other two parts have lengths `b` and `c`, where `a + b + c + c = n` and `a!= c` and `b!= c` and `a!= b`. 

To fix this, the program should be modified to iterate over all possible combinations of two pairs of equal lengths, not just the cases where `a = b`.

Here's an example of a case where the program does not follow the problem description:

Input: `n = 10`

The program should return `2` because there are two ways to divide the stick: `{1, 1, 4, 4}` and `{2, 2, 3, 3}`. However, the program will only return `1` because it only considers cases where `a = b`.

Therefore, the program does not always do what the problem description says, and its correctness is **False**. 

Here's a possible correction to the program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n < 6:
        return 0
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - 2 * a) // 2 + 1):
            c = n - 2 * a - 2 * b
            if c > 0 and (a!= b or c!= a) and (a!= c or b!= c) and (b!= c):
                count += 1
    return count
```

This corrected program iterates over all possible combinations of two pairs of equal lengths and checks if the conditions are met. If they are, it increments the count. This way, the program correctly counts all possible ways to divide the stick according to the problem description.
