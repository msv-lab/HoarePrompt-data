To determine the output state of the loop after all iterations, we need to analyze the loop code and the given output states for the first few iterations.

The loop code is:
```python
for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
    b = a
    rem = n - 2 * (a + b)
    if rem > 0 and rem % 2 == 0:
        if a!= rem // 2:
            count += 1
```
The initial state is: `n` is a positive integer and `n` is greater than or equal to 6, `count` is 0.

From the given output states, we can observe the following patterns:

- The loop executes at least once if `n` is greater than or equal to 6.
- The value of `a` and `b` increases by 1 in each iteration, and `rem` is updated accordingly.
- The value of `count` is incremented by 1 if `rem` is greater than 0, even, and `a` is not equal to half of `rem`.

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the value of `a` will be equal to `n // 4`, and `b` will be equal to `a`. The value of `rem` will be `n - 2 * (a + b)`, which can be simplified to `n - 4 * a`.

The value of `count` will be the number of times the conditions `rem > 0`, `rem % 2 == 0`, and `a!= rem // 2` are met.

If the loop does not execute (i.e., `n` is less than 6), the value of `count` will remain 0.

Therefore, the output state of the loop after all iterations is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `count` is the number of times the conditions `n - 4 * a > 0`, `n - 4 * a` is even, and `a` is not equal to `(n - 4 * a) // 2` are met for `a` in the range from 1 to `n // 4`, `a` is `n // 4`, `b` is `n // 4`.**
