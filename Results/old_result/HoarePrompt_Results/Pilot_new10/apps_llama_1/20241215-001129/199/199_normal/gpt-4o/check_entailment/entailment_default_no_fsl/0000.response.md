Correctness: **False**

The code does not accurately implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way it checks for possible divisions of the stick into four parts that can form a rectangle but not a square. 

The code only checks for cases where two parts have length `a` and the other two parts have length `(n - 4 * a) // 2`. However, the problem statement requires that we consider all possible ways to divide the stick into four parts such that it's possible to form a rectangle using these parts, but impossible to form a square.

A correct implementation should consider all possible combinations of four positive integers that sum up to `n`, and check if they can form a rectangle but not a square.

For example, if `n = 10`, the code will only consider cases like `{1, 1, 4, 4}` and `{2, 2, 3, 3}`, but not cases like `{1, 3, 3, 3}`. 

To fix this, we need to modify the code to iterate over all possible values for the four parts, not just pairs of equal values. 

Here's an example of how the corrected code might look like:
```python
n = int(input())
print(func_1(n))

def func_1(n):
    count = 0
    for a in range(1, n // 4 + 1):
        for b in range(a, (n - a) // 3 + 1):
            for c in range(b, (n - a - b) // 2 + 1):
                d = n - a - b - c
                if d >= c and a + c == b + d or a + b == c + d:
                    if not (a == b == c == d):
                        count += 1
    return count
```
However, this is still not the most efficient solution and might not cover all the edge cases correctly. A more efficient solution would involve using a more systematic approach to generate all possible combinations of four positive integers that sum up to `n`, and then filtering out those that can form a square. 

But in any case, the original code provided does not meet the problem requirements, so the correctness is **False**.
