To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer greater than 8, `a` is 2, `b` is 4, `ways` remains unchanged unless `a` is not equal to `b` and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`.

Given that `a` is 2, `b` is 4, and `n` is greater than 8, we first check if `a` is not equal to `b` (which is true since 2 is not equal to 4) and if 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`. 

The sum of `a` and `b` is 2 + 4 = 6. Two times this sum is 2 * 6 = 12. For `n` to be equal to this, `n` must be 12. However, the initial state only specifies that `n` is greater than 8, not necessarily equal to 12. So, `n` could be any integer greater than 8, including 12.

The code `ways += 1` increments `ways` by 1. This means `ways` will only be incremented if the conditions for changing `ways` are met (i.e., `a` is not equal to `b` and 2 times the sum of `a` and `b` equals `n`). Given `a` = 2 and `b` = 4, for the condition to be met, `n` must specifically be 12.

Therefore, if `n` is 12, `ways` will be incremented by 1. If `n` is any other integer greater than 8 (but not 12), `ways` remains unchanged because the condition for incrementing `ways` (2 * (`a` + `b`) = `n`) is not met for those values of `n`.

Given that `a` is 2 and `b` is 4, and considering all possible values of `n` greater than 8, `ways` will only be incremented (and thus changed from its initial state) if `n` equals 12.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 8, `a` is 2, `b` is 4, if `n` equals 12 then `ways` is incremented by 1, otherwise `ways` remains unchanged.**
