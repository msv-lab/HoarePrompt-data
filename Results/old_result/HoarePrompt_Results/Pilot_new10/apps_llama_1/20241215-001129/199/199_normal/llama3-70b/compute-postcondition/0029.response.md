Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 5, `a` is 3, `b` is 3, if `a` is not equal to `b` and `2 * (a + b)` equals `n`, then `ways` is the initial number of pairs satisfying `2 * (a + b) == n` plus 1, otherwise `ways` remains the initial number of pairs satisfying `2 * (a + b) == n`.**
