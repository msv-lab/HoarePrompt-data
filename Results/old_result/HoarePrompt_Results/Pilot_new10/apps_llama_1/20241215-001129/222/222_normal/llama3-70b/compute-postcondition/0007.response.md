According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `l` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` becomes 2, and `l` must be greater than 2 to allow another iteration. The other variables `n`, `k`, and `res` do not directly affect the loop's execution condition but are part of the state.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and must be greater than 2, `res` is a list containing the elements `1` and `k * 2 + 2`, `i` is 2**
