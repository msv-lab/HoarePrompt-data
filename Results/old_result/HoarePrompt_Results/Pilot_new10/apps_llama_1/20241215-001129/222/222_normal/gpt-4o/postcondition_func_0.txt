The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, generates a sequence of numbers starting from 1 and increasing by `2 * k + 1` up to `n`, and prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, effectively identifying positions in a sequence with a specified step size, handling all cases where `n` and `k` are within their specified ranges.
