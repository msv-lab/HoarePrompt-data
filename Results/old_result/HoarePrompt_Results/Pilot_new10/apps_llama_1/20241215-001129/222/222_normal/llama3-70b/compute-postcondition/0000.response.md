The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` updates the values of `n` and `k` based on the user's input. The `map(int, input().split())` function splits the input into two integers, which are then assigned to `n` and `k`, respectively.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
