Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program accepts two integers `n` and `k` as input, where `n` represents the number of skewers and `k` represents the number of skewers that are turned over when a skewer is turned.
2. The function `func_1(n, k)` generates a sequence of positions to turn over, starting from 1 and increasing by `2 * k + 1`. This sequence ensures that all skewers are turned over with the minimal possible number of actions.
3. The program prints the length of the sequence and the sequence itself, which corresponds to the minimum number of actions needed and the positions to turn over, respectively.

The key insight here is that by turning over every `2 * k + 1` skewers, we can ensure that all skewers are turned over with the minimal possible number of actions. This is because the turn-over operation affects `2 * k + 1` skewers, including the one being turned. By spacing out the turn-over operations by `2 * k + 1` skewers, we can avoid overlapping and ensure that all skewers are turned over exactly once.

The program handles all cases where `n` and `k` are within their specified ranges (1 ≤ `n` ≤ 1000 and 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 1000). The while loop correctly generates the sequence of positions to turn over, and the print statements output the correct results.

For example, when `n = 7` and `k = 2`, the program outputs `2` and `1 6`, which corresponds to turning over skewers 1, 2, and 3, and then skewers 4, 5, 6, and 7. Similarly, when `n = 5` and `k = 1`, the program outputs `2` and `1 4`, which corresponds to turning over skewers 1, 2, and 3, and then skewers 3, 4, and 5.

Overall, the program correctly implements the problem description and produces the desired output for all valid inputs.
