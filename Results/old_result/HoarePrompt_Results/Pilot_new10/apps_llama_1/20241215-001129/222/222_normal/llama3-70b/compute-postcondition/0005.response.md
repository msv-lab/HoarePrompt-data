According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `l`. If `i` is less than `l`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `l` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again `l` must be greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `l` is `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)` and must be greater than 1, `res` is a list containing the single element `1`, `i` is 1**
