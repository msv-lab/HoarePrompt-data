The list `positions` now contains two elements: the initial element `1` and the appended element `i`, which is equal to `2 * k + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `n` > `2 * k + 2`, `k` is an integer such that `0 <= k <= 1000`, `positions` is a list containing two elements: `1` and `2 * k + 2`, `i` is `2 * k + 2`**
