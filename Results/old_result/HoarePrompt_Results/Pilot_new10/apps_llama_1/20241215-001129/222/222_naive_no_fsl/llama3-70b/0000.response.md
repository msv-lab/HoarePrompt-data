Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to correctly implement the logic to minimize the number of actions needed to turn over all skewers. Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. The code calculates `l`, which represents the minimum number of actions required. This is calculated as `(n + k - 1) // (k * 2 + 1)`, which effectively groups the skewers into segments of `k * 2 + 1` length, allowing each segment to be turned over with a single action.

2. It then creates a list `res` to store the skewer numbers that need to be turned over. The loop `for i in range(l)` generates the indices of the skewers that need to be turned over, which are spaced `k * 2 + 1` apart. This is done by calculating `i * (k * 2 + 1) + 1`, which gives the skewer number that needs to be turned over in each segment.

3. Finally, the code prints the minimum number of actions `l` and the corresponding skewer numbers that need to be turned over.

The code correctly handles the edge cases, such as when `k` is 0 or when `n` is a multiple of `k * 2 + 1`. It also produces the correct output for the provided examples.

After analyzing the code and trying different test cases, I couldn't find any instance where the program fails to produce the correct output. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
