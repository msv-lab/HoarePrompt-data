Postcondition: **`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers such that `n` = input integer 1, `pos` = input integer 2, `l` = input integer 3, `r` = input integer 4, where `l` is not equal to 1, and it is not the case that `l` equals 1 and `r` equals `n`. If `r` equals `n`, then a value equal to `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been printed. Otherwise, `l` is not equal to 1, `r` is not equal to `n`, and the value 4 has been printed.**
