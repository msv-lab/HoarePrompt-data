Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not cover all the cases as described in the problem. For instance, when `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` is not equal to `n`, the code calculates `close_both_sides` which is the minimum of `move_to_l + (r - l + 2)` and `move_to_r + (r - l + 2)`. However, this calculation is incorrect. 

To calculate the minimum number of seconds, we should consider two scenarios: 
1. Move the cursor to `l`, then close all the tabs to the left of `l`, then move the cursor to `r`, and finally close all the tabs to the right of `r`. 
2. Move the cursor to `r`, then close all the tabs to the right of `r`, then move the cursor to `l`, and finally close all the tabs to the left of `l`.

The correct calculation should be the minimum of these two scenarios. 

Here is the correct code:

```python
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    if l == 1 and r == n:
        print(0)
    elif l == 1:
        print(abs(pos - r) + 1)
    elif r == n:
        print(abs(pos - l) + 1)
    else:
        move_to_l = abs(pos - l)
        move_to_r = abs(pos - r)
        close_from_l = move_to_l + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1
        close_from_r = move_to_r + 1 + abs(r - l) + 1
        print(min(close_from_l, close_from_r))
```

With this correction, the code should work correctly for all cases as described in the problem.
