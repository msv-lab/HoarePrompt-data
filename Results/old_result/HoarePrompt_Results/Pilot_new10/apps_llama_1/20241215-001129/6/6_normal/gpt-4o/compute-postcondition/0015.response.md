Postcondition: ***`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers such that `n` = input integer 1, `pos` = input integer 2, `l` = input integer 3, `r` = input integer 4. If `l` equals 1, the value `abs(pos - r) + 1` has been returned. If `l` does not equal 1 and `r` equals `n`, the value `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been printed. If `l` is not equal to 1 and `r` is not equal to `n`, the value 4 has been printed.***
