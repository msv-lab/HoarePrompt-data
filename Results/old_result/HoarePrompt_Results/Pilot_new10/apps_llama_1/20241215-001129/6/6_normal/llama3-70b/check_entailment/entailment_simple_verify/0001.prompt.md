You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Luba is surfing the Internet. She currently has n opened tabs in her browser, indexed from 1 to n from left to right. The mouse cursor is currently located at the pos-th tab. Luba needs to use the tabs with indices from l to r (inclusive) for her studies, and she wants to close all the tabs that don't belong to this segment as fast as possible.

Each second Luba can either try moving the cursor to the left or to the right (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, then she can move it to the tab max(i - 1, a) or to the tab min(i + 1, b)) or try closing all the tabs to the left or to the right of the cursor (if the cursor is currently at the tab i, she can close all the tabs with indices from segment [a, i - 1] or from segment [i + 1, b]). In the aforementioned expressions a and b denote the minimum and maximum index of an unclosed tab, respectively. For example, if there were 7 tabs initially and tabs 1, 2 and 7 are closed, then a = 3, b = 6.

What is the minimum number of seconds Luba has to spend in order to leave only the tabs with initial indices from l to r inclusive opened?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains four integer numbers n, pos, l, r (1 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ pos ≤ n, 1 ≤ l ≤ r ≤ n) — the number of the tabs, the cursor position and the segment which Luba needs to leave opened.


-----Output-----

Print one integer equal to the minimum number of seconds required to close all the tabs outside the segment [l, r].


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3 2 4

Output
5

Input
6 3 1 3

Output
1

Input
5 2 1 5

Output
0



-----Note-----

In the first test Luba can do the following operations: shift the mouse cursor to the tab 2, close all the tabs to the left of it, shift the mouse cursor to the tab 3, then to the tab 4, and then close all the tabs to the right of it.

In the second test she only needs to close all the tabs to the right of the current position of the cursor.

In the third test Luba doesn't need to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if pos < l:
        ans += l - pos
    if pos > r:
        ans += pos - r
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the cursor is already within the segment [l, r] but not at the edge of this segment. In such cases, the program should consider the minimum distance to move the cursor to either the left edge (l) or the right edge (r) of the segment.

For example, consider the input:
5 3 2 4

The program will output 3, but the correct answer is 4. The correct steps are: move the cursor to tab 2 (1 step), close tabs to the left of tab 2 (1 step), move the cursor to tab 4 (1 step), and close tabs to the right of tab 4 (1 step).

The program's logic is flawed because it only considers moving the cursor to the edge of the segment if the cursor is outside the segment, but it does not consider the optimal movement within the segment.

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to handle the case when the cursor is within the segment but not at the edge, and calculate the minimum distance to move the cursor to either the left edge or the right edge of the segment. 

However, a possible correct implementation in python could be:
```python
def func():
    (n, pos, l, r) = map(int, input().split())
    steps_to_l = abs(pos - l)
    steps_to_r = abs(pos - r)
    return min(steps_to_l + (l - 1) + (n - r), steps_to_r + (r - 1) + (n - r)) if pos < l or pos > r else max(l - 1, n - r)


func()
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, pos, l, and r are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100, 1 <= pos <= n, 1 <= l <= r <= n.
def func():
    n, pos, l, r = map(int, input().split())
    ans = 0
    if (pos < l) :
        ans += l - pos
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` equals the first input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer, if `pos` is less than `l`, then `ans` equals `l - pos` and `pos` is less than `l`. If `pos` is not less than `l`, then the state of `ans` and `pos` remains unchanged.
    if (pos > r) :
        ans += pos - r
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: `n` equals the first input integer, `l` equals the third input integer, `r` equals the fourth input integer. If `pos` is less than `l`, then `ans` equals `l - pos`. If `pos` is not less than `l` and not greater than `r`, then the state of `ans` and `pos` remains unchanged. If `pos` is greater than `r`, then `ans` has been increased by `pos - r`; if `pos` was initially less than `l`, then the new `ans` equals `l - r`; if `pos` was not less than `l`, then `ans` equals its previous value (if any) plus `pos - r`.
    ans += min(pos - 1, n - r) + max(0, l - 1)
    print(ans)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
