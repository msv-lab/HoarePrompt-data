Postcondition: **`n`, `pos`, `l`, and `r` are integers such that `n` = input integer 1, `pos` = input integer 2, `l` = input integer 3, `r` = input integer 4. If `l` equals 1 and `r` equals `n`, then 0 is returned and printed. If `l` equals 1 but `r` does not equal `n`, then the value `abs(pos - r) + 1` has been returned. If `l` does not equal 1 but `r` equals `n`, then the value `abs(pos - l) + 1` has been printed. If neither `l` equals 1 nor `r` equals `n`, then the value 4 has been printed.**
