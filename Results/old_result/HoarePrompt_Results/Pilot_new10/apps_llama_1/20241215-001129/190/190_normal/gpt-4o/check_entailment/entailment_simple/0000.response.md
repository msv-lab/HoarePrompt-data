Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the input, including the number of sticks `n` and their lengths `a`, which are stored in a list. This matches the input format described in the problem description.

2. **Calculating Minimum Cost**: The program iterates through all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100 (since stick lengths are between 1 and 100) and calculates the cost of adjusting all stick lengths to be almost good for the current `t`. The cost calculation considers sticks that need to be adjusted to either `t-1` or `t+1` to be within the almost good range.

3. **Finding the Best `t`**: The program keeps track of the `t` value that results in the minimum cost. It updates `min_cost` and `best_t` whenever it finds a `t` that yields a lower cost than the current minimum.

4. **Output**: After considering all possible `t` values, the program prints the `best_t` and the corresponding `min_cost`. This output matches the format requested in the problem description.

The program correctly handles all potential cases because:

- It considers all possible values of `t` that could be relevant given the constraints on stick lengths.
- It calculates the cost for each `t` based on the actual lengths of the sticks and their need to be adjusted to be almost good for `t`.
- It correctly identifies and stores the `t` value that results in the minimum total adjustment cost.

Given these points, the program accurately implements the problem description and should produce the correct results for any valid input within the specified constraints.
