To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the loop's behavior based on its code and the patterns observed from the output states after a few iterations.

The loop iterates over each `length` in the list `a`. For each `length`, it checks two conditions:
1. If `length` is less than `t - 1` (which is 2, since `t` is 3), it adds `t - 1 - length` to `current_cost`.
2. If `length` is greater than `t + 1` (which is 4), it adds `length - (t + 1)` to `current_cost`.

From the output states after the loop executes a few times, we can observe the following patterns:
- `n` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `a` must have at least as many elements as the number of times the loop has executed.
- `t` remains constant at 3.
- `length` takes the value of each element in `a` during each iteration.
- `current_cost` is incremented based on the value of `length` relative to `t`.

After all iterations, `length` will be the last element in `a` because the loop iterates over each element in `a` exactly once.

`current_cost` is updated based on the conditions related to `length` and `t`. If `length` is less than 2, `current_cost` increases by `2 - length`. If `length` is greater than 4, `current_cost` increases by `length - 4`. For `length` between 2 and 4 (inclusive), `current_cost` does not change.

Considering all possible scenarios:
- If `a` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `current_cost` remains 0.
- If `a` has elements, `current_cost` will be the sum of all adjustments made based on the conditions for each `length` in `a`.

Given these observations, the output state after all iterations of the loop can be described as follows:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
- `t` is 3.
- `length` is the last element in `a`.
- `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments for each `length` in `a` that is either less than 2 or greater than 4, calculated as the sum of `(2 - length)` for `length < 2` and `(length - 4)` for `length > 4`.

Therefore, the output state can be summarized as:

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is 3, `length` is the last element in `a`, and `current_cost` is the sum of adjustments based on elements in `a` that are outside the range [2, 4].**
