According to the code, the loop will execute regardless of the values of `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, and `best_t` because it is a simple range-based loop that iterates over a fixed range. The loop variable `t` will take on values from 1 to 100 (inclusive) in each iteration. 

For the loop to start executing, `t` should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is 1. Since `t` is not defined before the loop, we need to adjust its state to reflect its initial value in the loop.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1**
