Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 3 elements, `t` is 3, `length` is the next element in the list. If `length` is less than 2, `current_cost` equals the previous `current_cost` + 2 - `length`. If `length` is greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 4, `current_cost` remains unchanged. If `length` is greater than 4, `current_cost` is updated to `current_cost + length - 4`.***
