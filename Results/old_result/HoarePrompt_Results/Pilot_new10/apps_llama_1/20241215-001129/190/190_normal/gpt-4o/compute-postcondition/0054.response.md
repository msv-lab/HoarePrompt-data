According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `t`. If `t` is less than 100, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `t` must be increased by 1, so `t` is 3. 
State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is 3, `length` is the last element in `a`, and `current_cost` is the sum of all `max(1 - length, 0, length - 3)` for each `length` in `a`**
