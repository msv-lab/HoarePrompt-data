To determine the output state, we need to consider the given initial state and the provided code snippet. The initial state consists of:
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 2 elements
- `min_cost` is positive infinity
- `best_t` is -1
- `t` is 1
- `current_cost` and `length` are not defined in the initial state, but they are used in the code snippet.

Given the code snippet:
```python
current_cost += t - 1 - length
```
This line of code modifies the value of `current_cost` by adding the result of the expression `t - 1 - length` to it. However, without the initial values of `current_cost` and `length`, we can only express the change in terms of these variables.

Since `t` is 1, the expression simplifies to:
```python
current_cost += 1 - 1 - length
```
Which further simplifies to:
```python
current_cost += -length
```
Or:
```python
current_cost -= length
```

The output state, considering the changes and the initial state, is:
- `n` is an input integer
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 2 elements
- `min_cost` is positive infinity
- `best_t` is -1
- `t` is 1
- `current_cost` is decreased by the value of `length` from its previous state (note: the initial value of `current_cost` is not provided, so we can't give a specific value, only the change).

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is `current_cost` - `length`**
