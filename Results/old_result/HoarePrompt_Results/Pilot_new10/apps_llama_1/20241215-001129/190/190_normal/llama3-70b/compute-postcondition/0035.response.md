Postcondition: ***`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers with a length of at least `n // 2` where `n // 2` is less than or equal to 1000 and the `n // 2`-th element is less than 100, `n` is at least 2 and `n // 2` is a valid index for `sticks`, `mid` is less than 100, if `cost` < `min_cost`, then `i` is `mid + 2`, `t` remains unchanged, `cost` is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each `x` in `sticks` and `mid + 2` and `mid + 1`, `min_cost` is equal to `cost`, and `min_t` is `mid + 2`; otherwise, `i`, `t`, `cost`, `min_cost`, and `min_t` retain their previous values***
