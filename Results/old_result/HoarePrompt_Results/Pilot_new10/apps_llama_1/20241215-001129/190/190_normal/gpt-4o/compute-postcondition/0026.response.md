The code updates the value of `min_cost` to be equal to `current_cost`. The previous value of `min_cost` was positive infinity, and the value of `current_cost` is the sum of `max(0, length - 2)` for all `length` in `a`, which is less than the initial value of `min_cost`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `min_cost` is equal to `current_cost` which is the sum of `max(0, length - 2)` for all `length` in `a`, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `min_cost` is the sum of `max(0, length - 2)` for all `length` in `a`, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1**
