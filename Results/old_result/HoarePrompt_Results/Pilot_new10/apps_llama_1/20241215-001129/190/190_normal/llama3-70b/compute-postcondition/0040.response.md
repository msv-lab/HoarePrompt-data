Postcondition: ***`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers with a length of at least `n // 2` where `n // 2` is less than or equal to 1000 and the `n // 2`-th element is less than 100, `n` is at least 2 and `n // 2` is a valid index for `sticks`, `mid` is less than 100, `i` is the current value of `i` plus 1, `t` remains unchanged. If `cost` is less than `min_cost`, then `min_cost` equals `cost` and `min_t` equals `i`. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `min_t` remain unchanged.***
