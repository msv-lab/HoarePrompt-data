Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. It iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100 and calculates the cost of adjusting the stick lengths to be within the range `[t-1, t+1]`. It keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding value of `t`.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of why the program is correct:

1. The program reads the input correctly, including the number of sticks `n` and their lengths `a`.
2. It initializes `min_cost` to infinity and `best_t` to -1, which will store the minimum cost and the corresponding value of `t`, respectively.
3. The program iterates over all possible values of `t` from 1 to 100. For each `t`, it calculates the cost of adjusting the stick lengths to be within the range `[t-1, t+1]`.
4. If a stick length is less than `t-1`, the program adds the difference between `t-1` and the stick length to the current cost. If a stick length is greater than `t+1`, the program adds the difference between the stick length and `t+1` to the current cost.
5. If the current cost is less than the minimum cost found so far, the program updates `min_cost` and `best_t`.
6. After iterating over all possible values of `t`, the program prints the value of `best_t` and the minimum cost `min_cost`.

The program correctly handles all potential cases of stick length distributions because it considers all possible values of `t` and calculates the cost of adjusting the stick lengths to be within the range `[t-1, t+1]`. It also correctly updates the minimum cost and the corresponding value of `t` if a better solution is found.

The program does not have any apparent errors or edge cases that would cause it to deviate from the problem description. It accurately implements the problem statement and provides the correct output for the given examples.
