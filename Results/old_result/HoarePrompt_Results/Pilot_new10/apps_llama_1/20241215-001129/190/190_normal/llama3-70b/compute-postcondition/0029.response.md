`min_t` is assigned the value of `i`, and `i` was `mid + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers with a length of at least `n // 2` where `n // 2` is less than or equal to 1000 and the `n // 2`-th element is less than 100, `n` is at least 2 and `n // 2` is a valid index for `sticks`, `mid` is less than 100, `t` was equal to `mid`, `min_t` is `mid + 1`, `i` was `mid + 1`, `cost` equals `min_cost` equals `sum(min(abs(x - (mid + 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`.
