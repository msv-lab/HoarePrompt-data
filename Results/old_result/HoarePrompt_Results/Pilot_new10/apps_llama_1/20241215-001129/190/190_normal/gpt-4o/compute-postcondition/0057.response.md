Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 3, the initial value of `length` is the first element in `a`, and the current value of `length` is less than `t - 1`, which is less than 2, `current_cost` is 0**
