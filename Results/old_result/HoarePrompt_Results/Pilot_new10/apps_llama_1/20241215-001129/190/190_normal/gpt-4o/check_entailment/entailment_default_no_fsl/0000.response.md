Correctness: **True**

The provided code does what the problem description says for every potential case. It iterates over all possible target lengths (from 1 to 100) and calculates the cost of adjusting the stick lengths to be within a range of the form [t-1, t+1]. It keeps track of the minimum cost and the corresponding target length, and finally prints the target length along with the minimum cost.

The code handles all potential cases of stick length distributions, including cases where the stick lengths are already almost good for some target length, and cases where the stick lengths need to be adjusted to be within the desired range.

The output hints provided agree with the code, and the examples given in the problem description are also handled correctly by the code. For example, for the input [3, 10 1 4], the code correctly outputs [3, 7], and for the input [5, 1 1 2 2 3], the code correctly outputs [2, 0].

The code's time complexity is O(n*100), where n is the number of sticks, which is acceptable given the constraints of the problem (n <= 1000 and stick lengths <= 100). The space complexity is O(1), which is also acceptable.

Overall, the code is correct and efficient, and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem description.
