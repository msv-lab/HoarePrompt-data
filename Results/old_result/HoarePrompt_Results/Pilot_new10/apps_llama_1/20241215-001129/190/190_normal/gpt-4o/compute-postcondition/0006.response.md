According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `a`. If `a` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and `current_cost` is 0. For the loop to execute, `a` must have at least 1 element and `length` is the first element in the list `a`.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, `current_cost` is 0, `length` is the first element in the list `a`**
