Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `current_cost` is 0, the length is the first element in the list `a` and is more than or equal to `t - 1` (i.e., `length` is more than or equal to 1), and the current value of `length` is more than `t + 1` (i.e., `length` is more than 3)**
