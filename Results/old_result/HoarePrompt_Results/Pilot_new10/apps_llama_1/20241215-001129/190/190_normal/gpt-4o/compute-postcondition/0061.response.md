The code `current_cost += length - (t + 1)` updates the value of `current_cost` by adding the difference between `length` and `t + 1`. Given that `t` is 3, the expression `t + 1` equals 4. 

Since `length` is greater than `t + 1` (which is 4) and `length` is initially the first element in `a`, and given that elements in `a` are between 1 and 100 inclusive, `length` must be at least 5 because it has to be more than 4.

The initial value of `current_cost` is 0. After executing the code, `current_cost` becomes `0 + (length - 4)`, which simplifies to `length - 4`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `length` is greater than 4 and is the first element in `a`, `t` is 3, and `current_cost` is `length - 4`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `length` is at least 5 and is the first element in `a`, `t` is 3, and `current_cost` is `length - 4`.**
