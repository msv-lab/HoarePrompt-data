Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 1, and if the length of `a` is more than `t` + 1, then `current_cost` is `original_current_cost + length - 2`, otherwise no changes are made**
