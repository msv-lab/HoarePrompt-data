To solve this, let's break down the initial state and the given code snippet.

Initial State:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 3 elements.
- `t` is 2.
- `min_cost` is positive infinity.
- `best_t` is -1.
- `length` is the third element in the list `a`.
- `current_cost` is not explicitly defined in the initial state, but it's implied to exist because the code snippet increments it.

Given Code:
```python
current_cost += t - 1 - length
```

Step-by-Step Analysis:
1. `t` is 2.
2. `length` is the third element in the list `a`, so its value is `a[2]`.
3. The expression `t - 1 - length` evaluates to `2 - 1 - a[2]`, which simplifies to `1 - a[2]`.
4. `current_cost` is incremented by the value of `1 - a[2]`.

Since `a[2]` (or `length`) can be any integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `1 - a[2]` will be a value between -99 and 1 (inclusive), because the smallest possible value for `a[2]` is 1 and the largest is 100.

Output State:
- `n` is an input integer.
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 3 elements.
- `t` is 2.
- `min_cost` is positive infinity.
- `best_t` is -1.
- `length` is the third element in the list `a`, so `length = a[2]`.
- `current_cost` has been incremented by `1 - a[2]`, so its new value is the old value of `current_cost` plus `1 - a[2]`. If we denote the original value of `current_cost` as `original_current_cost`, then the new value of `current_cost` is `original_current_cost + (1 - a[2])`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 3 elements, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `length` is `a[2]`, and `current_cost` is `original_current_cost + (1 - a[2])`.**
