The code `current_cost += length - (t + 1)` affects the value of `current_cost` by adding the difference between `length` and `t + 1` to its current value. Given the initial state, we know that `length` is the second element in the list `a`, and `t` is 2. 

So, `length - (t + 1)` becomes `length - 3`, since `t` is 2 and `t + 1` equals 3. 

The initial state of `current_cost` is not specified, so we will express its new value as its previous value plus `length - 3`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `length` is the second element in the list `a`, and `current_cost` is its previous value plus `length - 3`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is 2, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `length` is the second element in the list `a`, and `current_cost` is its previous value plus `length - 3`.**
