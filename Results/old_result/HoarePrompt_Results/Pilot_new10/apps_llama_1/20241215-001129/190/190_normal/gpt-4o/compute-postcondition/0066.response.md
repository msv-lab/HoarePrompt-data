To determine the output state, we need to consider the changes made by the given code snippet. The code snippet is `current_cost += length - (t + 1)`. 

Given the initial state: 
- `n` is an input integer, 
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements, 
- `t` is 3.

The variable `current_cost` is not defined in the initial state, so we will assume it has been defined previously but its initial value is unknown. The variable `length` is also not defined in the initial state, so we will consider it as an unknown value as well.

After executing the code, `current_cost` will be updated by adding `length - (t + 1)` to it. Since `t` is 3, the expression `length - (t + 1)` simplifies to `length - 4`. 

Therefore, the output state is: 
- `n` is an input integer, 
- `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements, 
- `t` is 3, 
- `current_cost` is `current_cost + length - 4`, which can also be written as `current_cost` is increased by `length - 4`, 
- `length` is an unknown value.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 2 elements, `t` is 3, `current_cost` is increased by `length - 4`, `length` is an unknown value.**
