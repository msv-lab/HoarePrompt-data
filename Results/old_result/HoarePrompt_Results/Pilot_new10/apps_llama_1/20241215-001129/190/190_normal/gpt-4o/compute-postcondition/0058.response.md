The code updates the value of `current_cost` by adding `t - 1 - length` to it. Given that `t` is 3 and `length` is less than `t - 1`, which is 2, we can infer that `length` is either 0 or 1. Since `length` is the first element in `a` and all elements in `a` are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `length` must be 1 because it cannot be 0.

So, `t - 1 - length` equals `3 - 1 - 1`, which is `1`. 

Thus, `current_cost` becomes `0 + 1`, which equals `1`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 3, `length` is 1, and `current_cost` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) that must have at least 1 element, `t` is 3, `length` is 1, and `current_cost` is 1**
