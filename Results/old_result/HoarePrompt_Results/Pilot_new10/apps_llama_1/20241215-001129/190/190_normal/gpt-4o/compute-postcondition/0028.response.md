Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is 1. If `current_cost` is less than the initial `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to the sum of `max(0, length - 2)` for all `length` in `a`, and `best_t` is set to 1. Otherwise, the values of `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged, with `min_cost` being positive infinity and `best_t` being -1.**
