Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive) with at least 2 elements, `min_cost` is positive infinity, `best_t` is -1, `t` is 2. If `length` is greater than `t + 1`, then `current_cost` is its previous value plus `length - 3`. Regardless of the `length` value, `n`, `a`, `min_cost`, `best_t`, and `t` retain their initial values.***
