Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `t` is 2, `length` is the last element in `a`, and `current_cost` is the sum of all `max(1 - length, 0, length - 3)` for each `length` in `a`. If `current_cost` is less than the initial `min_cost`, then `min_cost` is updated to `current_cost` and `best_t` is set to 2. Otherwise, `min_cost` and `best_t` remain unchanged.**
