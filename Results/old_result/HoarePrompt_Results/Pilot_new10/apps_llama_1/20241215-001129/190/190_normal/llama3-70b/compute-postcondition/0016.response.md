To find the output state, let's analyze the given code and the initial state.

The initial state is as follows:
- `sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100.
- The count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000.
- `n` is an input integer that is at least 2.
- `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks` and is at least 2.
- `t` is equal to `mid`.
- `i` is `mid - 2`.
- `cost` is equal to the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `mid - 2` or `mid - 1`.
- `min_cost` and `min_t` retain their values unless updated.

The code provided is:
```python
min_cost = cost
```
This line of code assigns the value of `cost` to `min_cost`. 

So, after executing this line of code, `min_cost` will be equal to `cost`, which is the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `mid - 2` or `mid - 1`.

The other variables (`sticks`, `n`, `mid`, `t`, `i`, `cost`, and `min_t`) retain their values as they were before executing this line of code.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; 
`n` is an input integer that is at least 2; 
`mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks` and is at least 2; 
`t` is equal to `mid`; 
`i` is `mid - 2`; 
`cost` is equal to the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `mid - 2` or `mid - 1`; 
`min_cost` is equal to `cost`;
`min_t` retains its value unless updated.

Output State: **`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; `n` is an input integer that is at least 2; `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks` and is at least 2; `t` is equal to `mid`; `i` is `mid - 2`; `cost` is equal to the sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `mid - 2` or `mid - 1`; `min_cost` is equal to `cost`; `min_t` retains its value unless updated**
