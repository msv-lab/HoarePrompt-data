You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Salem gave you $n$ sticks with integer positive lengths $a_1, a_2, \ldots, a_n$.

For every stick, you can change its length to any other positive integer length (that is, either shrink or stretch it). The cost of changing the stick's length from $a$ to $b$ is $|a - b|$, where $|x|$ means the absolute value of $x$.

A stick length $a_i$ is called almost good for some integer $t$ if $|a_i - t| \le 1$.

Salem asks you to change the lengths of some sticks (possibly all or none), such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer $t$ and the total cost of changing is minimum possible. The value of $t$ is not fixed in advance and you can choose it as any positive integer. 

As an answer, print the value of $t$ and the minimum cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains a single integer $n$ ($1 \le n \le 1000$) — the number of sticks.

The second line contains $n$ integers $a_i$ ($1 \le a_i \le 100$) — the lengths of the sticks.


-----Output-----

Print the value of $t$ and the minimum possible cost. If there are multiple optimal choices for $t$, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
3
10 1 4

Output
3 7

Input
5
1 1 2 2 3

Output
2 0



-----Note-----

In the first example, we can change $1$ into $2$ and $10$ into $4$ with cost $|1 - 2| + |10 - 4| = 1 + 6 = 7$ and the resulting lengths $[2, 4, 4]$ are almost good for $t = 3$.

In the second example, the sticks lengths are already almost good for $t = 2$, so we don't have to do anything.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum((abs(x - mid) for x in sticks))
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
    print(min_t, min_cost)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires finding the minimum cost to change the lengths of sticks such that all sticks' lengths are almost good for some positive integer `t`. The provided program attempts to solve this by starting with the middle stick length as the initial `t` and then exploring other possible values of `t` by iterating over the range of possible stick lengths.

However, the issue with the program is that it does not correctly calculate the minimum cost for each possible value of `t`. The line `cost = sum((min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks))` calculates the minimum cost for a given `t` as the sum of the minimum distances between each stick length and either `t` or `t + 1`. This is incorrect because it assumes that the minimum cost is always achieved by changing the stick length to either `t` or `t + 1`, which is not necessarily true.

A counterexample to the program is when the input is `5` and the stick lengths are `1 1 100`. In this case, the program will incorrectly calculate the minimum cost as `sum((min(abs(1 - 50), abs(1 - 51))) + (min(abs(1 - 50), abs(1 - 51))) + (min(abs(100 - 50), abs(100 - 51)))) = 2 + 2 + 50 = 54`, whereas the correct minimum cost is `0` when `t` is `1` or `100`.

To correctly solve this problem, a more exhaustive approach is needed, such as iterating over all possible values of `t` and calculating the minimum cost for each one. The minimum cost for a given `t` can be calculated as the sum of the minimum distances between each stick length and either `t - 1`, `t`, or `t + 1`. 

Here is an example of how the correct program could look like:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    min_cost = float('inf')
    min_t = None
    for t in range(1, 101):
        cost = 0
        for x in sticks:
            cost += min(abs(x - (t - 1)), abs(x - t), abs(x - (t + 1)))
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = t
    print(min_t, min_cost)
```

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: There exists a list of positive integers, which will be referred to as the stick lengths, where each integer is in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000. This list of stick lengths will be provided as input to the function.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    sticks = list(map(int, input().split()))
    sticks.sort()
    mid = sticks[n // 2]
    cost = sum(abs(x - mid) for x in sticks)
    t = mid
    min_cost = cost
    min_t = t
    for i in range(mid - 1, 0, -1):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i + 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, each in the range of 1 to 100, and the count of these stick lengths is in the range of 1 to 1000; `n` is an input integer that is at least 2 if the loop executes, or any integer if the loop does not execute; `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks` and is at least 1; `t` is equal to `mid`; `min_cost` is the minimum sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `i` or `i + 1` for any `i` from 1 to `mid`; `min_t` is the value of `i` that achieves this minimum sum.
    for i in range(mid + 1, 101):
        cost = sum(min(abs(x - i), abs(x - (i - 1))) for x in sticks)
        
        if cost < min_cost:
            min_cost = cost
            min_t = i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers, `n` is an integer, `mid` is the `n // 2`-th element in `sticks`, `t` equals `mid`, `min_cost` is the minimum sum of the minimum absolute differences between each stick length in `sticks` and either `i` or `i - 1` for any `i` from `mid + 1` to `100`, and `min_t` is the value of `i` that achieves this minimum sum.
    print(min_t, min_cost)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
