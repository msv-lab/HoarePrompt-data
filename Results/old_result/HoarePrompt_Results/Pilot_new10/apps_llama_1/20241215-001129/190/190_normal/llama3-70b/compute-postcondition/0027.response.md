Postcondition: **`sticks` is a sorted list of positive integers with a length of at least `n // 2` where `n // 2` is less than or equal to 1000 and the `n // 2`-th element is less than 100, `n` is at least 2 and `n // 2` is a valid index for `sticks`, `mid` is less than 100, initially `t` was equal to `mid`, `min_cost` was defined based on `mid` and `sticks`, `min_t` was defined based on `min_cost`, initially `i` was `mid + 1`, and initially `cost` was `sum(min(abs(x - (mid + 1)), abs(x - mid)) for x in sticks)`. The current value of `cost` is lower than the current value of `min_cost`.**
