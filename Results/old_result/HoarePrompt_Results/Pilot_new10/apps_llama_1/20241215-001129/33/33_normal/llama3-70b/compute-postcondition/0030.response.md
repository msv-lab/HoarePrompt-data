The code `curr_lat -= t / 111.195` decreases the value of `curr_lat` by `t / 111.195`. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1
- `t` is an integer
- `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither
- `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90]
- `dir` is 'North' if `curr_lat` is -90, or any of the allowed values if `curr_lat` is not -90
- `curr_lat` is less than 90 or `dir` is 'South' if `curr_lat` is 90

The value of `curr_lat` after executing the code will be `curr_lat - t / 111.195`.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `dir`) are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither, `curr_lat` is `curr_lat - t / 111.195`**
