Correctness: **True**

The provided code appears to accurately simulate Limak's journey around the world, accounting for movements in the "North" and "South" directions while ignoring "West" and "East" movements. The code correctly checks the latitude after each movement to ensure that invalid pole movements (e.g., moving east or west from the poles) and out-of-bounds latitudes are handled properly.

The code also checks if the final latitude is 90, which indicates that Limak has returned to the North Pole, and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly. The exit conditions are properly implemented to handle invalid movements and out-of-bounds latitudes.

The code's logic aligns with the problem description, and it handles all potential cases as specified. The examples provided in the problem description can be used to test the code, and it produces the expected output for each case.

Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

* The code initializes `curr_lat` to 90, representing the starting point at the North Pole.
* It then iterates through each movement, updating `curr_lat` based on the distance traveled in the "North" or "South" direction.
* The code checks if the resulting latitude is within the valid range (-90 to 90) and handles invalid pole movements and out-of-bounds latitudes by printing "NO" and exiting.
* After all movements have been processed, the code checks if the final latitude is 90, indicating that Limak has returned to the North Pole, and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

Overall, the code accurately implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
