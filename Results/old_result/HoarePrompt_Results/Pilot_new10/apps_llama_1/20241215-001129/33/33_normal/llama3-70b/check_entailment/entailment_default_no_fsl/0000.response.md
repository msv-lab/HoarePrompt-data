Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly simulates the movement of Limak based on the given directions and distances. It checks for valid movements, handles invalid pole movements, and accounts for out-of-bounds latitudes. The program also correctly determines whether the final latitude is 90, which corresponds to the North Pole.

Here's why the code is correct:

1.  **Correct handling of latitude calculations**: The code updates the `curr_lat` variable based on the direction and distance moved, which is done by dividing the distance by 111.195 (the approximate distance between two degrees of latitude in kilometers). This ensures accurate calculations of the current latitude.

2.  **Checking for valid pole movements**: The code checks if Limak is at the North Pole (latitude 90) or the South Pole (latitude -90) and only allows movements in the valid direction. If an invalid movement is attempted, the program immediately prints "NO" and exits.

3.  **Out-of-bounds latitude handling**: The code checks if the current latitude is outside the valid range of -90 to 90. If it is, the program immediately prints "NO" and exits, indicating an invalid movement.

4.  **Correct final position check**: After all movements have been simulated, the program checks if Limak has ended up back at the North Pole (latitude 90). If so, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The provided examples agree with the expected output, and the code handles different scenarios, including:

*   Valid movements that end at the North Pole
*   Invalid movements at the poles
*   Out-of-bounds latitudes
*   Invalid final positions

Based on these observations, it can be concluded that the code correctly implements the problem description and handles every potential case.
