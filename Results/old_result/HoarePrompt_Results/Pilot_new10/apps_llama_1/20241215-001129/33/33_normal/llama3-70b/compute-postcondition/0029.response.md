To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1.
- `t` is an integer.
- `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither.
- `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90].
- The relationship between `curr_lat` and `dir` is as follows:
  - If `curr_lat` is -90, then `dir` is 'North'.
  - If `curr_lat` is not -90, then `dir` can be any of the allowed values ('North', 'South', or neither).
  - If `curr_lat` is less than 90, then `dir` can be 'South' only if `curr_lat` is not 90.
  - If `curr_lat` is 90, then `dir` is 'South'.

The code snippet given is:
```python
curr_lat += t / 111.195
```

This line of code updates the value of `curr_lat` by adding the result of the division of `t` by 111.195 to it.

Given that `t` is an integer and `curr_lat` is initially within the range [-90, 90], after the execution of the code, `curr_lat` will be updated to `curr_lat + t / 111.195`. 

Considering the factor `111.195`, which represents the distance of one degree of latitude in kilometers, the change in `curr_lat` is equivalent to moving `t` kilometers along the latitude.

The new value of `curr_lat` will still be dependent on the original value of `curr_lat` and the integer value of `t`.

Therefore, the output state, considering all the initial conditions and the impact of the code, is:
- `n` is an integer greater than 1 (unchanged).
- `t` is an integer (unchanged).
- `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither (its value might need adjustment based on the new `curr_lat`, but the code does not explicitly update `dir`).
- `curr_lat` is `curr_lat + t / 111.195`, which means its new value depends on the previous value of `curr_lat` and the value of `t`. Given the initial constraints and the update, `curr_lat`'s range and relation to `dir` might change, but without explicit new values for `t` and `curr_lat`, we can only describe its new value as a function of its old value and `t`.

Thus, the output state reflects these changes and unchanged conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither, and `curr_lat` is `curr_lat + t / 111.195`, with its relation to `dir` potentially updated based on the new latitude value, but `dir` itself is not explicitly updated by the code.**
