The function `func` accepts a sequence of 1 to 50 movements, each consisting of a non-negative integer distance between 1 and 10^6 and a direction that is one of "North", "South", "West", "East". However, upon analyzing the code, it appears that the movements in the "West" and "East" directions are ignored, as the code only updates the latitude (`curr_lat`) when the direction is either "North" or "South". 

The function simulates these movements on a latitude scale, where moving "North" increases the latitude and moving "South" decreases it. The function checks if the final latitude is within the range [-90, 90] and also checks for invalid movements at the poles (i.e., trying to move "South" from -90 latitude or "North" from 90 latitude). 

If any of these conditions are met, the function prints "NO" and exits. Otherwise, it checks if the final latitude is equal to 90 and prints "YES" if it is, and "NO" otherwise.

Functionality: ** The function simulates a sequence of 1 to 50 movements with distances between 1 and 10^6 in the "North", "South", "West", or "East" directions, ignoring "West" and "East" movements, and checks if the resulting latitude is equal to 90 after accounting for valid "North" and "South" movements, printing "YES" if the final latitude is 90 and "NO" otherwise, while also handling invalid pole movements and out-of-bounds latitudes by printing "NO" and exiting **
