Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), if `position` is not equal to 0, then `position` is an integer between 1 and 20000 (inclusive) and `valid` is `False`; otherwise, the state of `position` and `valid` remains as defined by the precondition, with `position` being 0.**
