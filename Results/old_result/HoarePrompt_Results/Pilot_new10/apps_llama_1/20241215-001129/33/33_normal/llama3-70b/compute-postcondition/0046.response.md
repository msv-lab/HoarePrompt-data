The code updates the value of `curr_lat` by adding `t / 111.195` to it. The previous value of `curr_lat` was within the range [-90, 90]. The value of `t` is an integer, and `n` is an integer greater than 0, but `n` is not used in this code snippet. The value of `dir` is a string input, but it is also not used in this code snippet.

The new value of `curr_lat` is `curr_lat + t / 111.195`. Since `t` is an integer and `111.195` is a constant, `t / 111.195` is a floating-point number. The range of `curr_lat` after the update depends on the values of `t` and the initial value of `curr_lat`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string input, `curr_lat` is `curr_lat + t / 111.195`**
