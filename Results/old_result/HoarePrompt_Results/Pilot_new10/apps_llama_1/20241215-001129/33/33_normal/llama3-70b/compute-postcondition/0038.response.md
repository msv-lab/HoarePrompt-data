The `exit()` statement terminates the program immediately. The values of `n`, `t`, and `dir` are retained, but the program stops executing. The condition regarding `curr_lat` being within the range [-90, 90] is no longer relevant as the program has terminated. Since the program has printed 'NO' before termination, this output remains. The `exit()` statement does not change the values of `n`, `t`, or `dir`, but it ends the program's execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither, the program has printed 'NO', and the program has terminated with `n`, `t`, and `dir` retaining their respective values.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 1, `t` is an integer, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither, the program has printed 'NO', and the program has terminated**
