The `exit()` function is called, which terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables `n`, `t`, and `dir` do not change, but the program stops executing. The fact that 'NO' has been printed to the console is still true. Since the program has terminated, no further changes can occur to the variables or the state of the program.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is an integer, `dir` is a string, 'NO' has been printed to the console, and the program has terminated.**
