The value of `valid` is set to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `position` is 0, `valid` is `False`, `t` is an integer input by the user, `dir` is 'South', and the current value of `position + t` is greater than 20000.
