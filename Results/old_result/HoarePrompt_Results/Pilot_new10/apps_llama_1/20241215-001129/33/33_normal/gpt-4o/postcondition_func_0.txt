The function processes a series of movements defined by distance and direction, checks the validity of these movements based on given constraints (bounds and direction at boundary positions), and prints "YES" if all movements are valid and end at the starting position; otherwise, it prints "NO", covering all potential cases including invalid inputs and edge scenarios not explicitly handled by the function's logic.
