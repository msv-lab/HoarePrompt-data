The code `position += t` updates the value of `position` by adding `t` to it. The initial value of `position` is 0, so the new value of `position` will be `0 + t`, which simplifies to `t`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is still an integer input by the user, `dir` is still 'South'. 

The value of `valid` depends on the new value of `position`. If `position + t` (which is now `t + t` or `2*t`) is greater than 20000, then `valid` is `False`. Otherwise, the state of `valid` is not specified in the given postconditions.

So, the new state of `position` is `t`, and the state of `valid` is `False` if `t` is greater than 10000, otherwise it is not specified.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `t` is an integer input by the user, `dir` is 'South', `position` is `t`, and if `t` is greater than 10000, then `valid` is `False`.**
