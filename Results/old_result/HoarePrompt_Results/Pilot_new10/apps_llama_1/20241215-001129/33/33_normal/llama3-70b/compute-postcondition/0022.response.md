Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither. The initial value of `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90] because if it was initially less than -90 or greater than 90, the program would have stopped execution and 'NO' would have been printed. If `curr_lat` is -90, then `dir` is 'North' because if `dir` was not 'North', 'NO' would have been printed to the console and the program would have terminated. For the current execution, `curr_lat` equals 90 and the current value of `dir` is not 'South', `dir` is either 'North' or neither.**
