The code `t, dir = input().split()` splits the input string into two parts and assigns them to `t` and `dir`. The previous values of `t` and `dir` are overwritten. 

`t` is assigned the value of the first part of the input string, which is a string. 
`dir` is assigned the value of the second part of the input string, which can be any string.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is a string input, `dir` is a string input, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90].

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than 0, `t` is a string input, `dir` is a string input, `curr_lat` is within the range [-90, 90]**
