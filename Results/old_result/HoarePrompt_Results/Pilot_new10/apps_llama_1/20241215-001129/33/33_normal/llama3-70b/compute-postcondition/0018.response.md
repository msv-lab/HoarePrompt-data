Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement, `dir` is either 'North', 'South', or neither. The program has checked the value of `curr_lat` and since it is within the range [-90, 90], the execution continues. The current value of `curr_lat` is -90 and the current value of `dir` is either 'South' or neither, since it is not 'North'.**
