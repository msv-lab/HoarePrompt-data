The code updates the `curr_lat` variable by adding `t / 111.195` to it. Since `t` is an integer and `111.195` is a constant, `t / 111.195` will result in a floating-point number. The initial value of `curr_lat` is 90, and the value of `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement. 

The value of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50, `t` is still the integer value of the first part of the input movement, and `dir` is still 'North'. Only the value of `curr_lat` is updated.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50, `t` is the integer value of the first part of the input movement, `dir` is 'North', `curr_lat` is 90 + `t` / 111.195**
