The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `trophies`. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'. After executing the function body, the function returns a value based on the following conditions: 
Case_1: The program returns 0; 
Case_2: The program returns `max_length` which is the length of the single sequence of 'G's in the `trophies` string; 
Case_3: The program returns the minimum value between the maximum length of any sequence of 'G's (including those separated by a single character) plus one, and the original number of iterations `n`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and a string `trophies` of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S', and return a value based on the sequence of 'G's in the `trophies` string.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, an integer n and a string trophies of length n consisting of 'G' and 'S', and returns a value based on the sequence of 'G's in the trophies string, either 0, the length of a single sequence of 'G's, or the minimum value between the maximum length of any sequence of 'G's plus one and the original number of iterations n.**
