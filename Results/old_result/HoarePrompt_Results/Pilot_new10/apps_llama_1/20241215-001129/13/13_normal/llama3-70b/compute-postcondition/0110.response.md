To determine the output state after executing the given Python code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the program's state, considering the initial conditions provided.


The code snippet is:
```python
beauty += 1
```
Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive),
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters,
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`,
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`,
- `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`,
- `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character,
- `right` equals `n`,
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and 1,
- `i` is greater than 1 and less than `n - 1`,
- `s[i]` is 'G',
- `s[i + 1]` is 'S',
- `j` is the index of the first 'S' character encountered while iterating from `i - 1` towards the beginning of `s`, or `-1` if no 'S' character is found, however the current value of `s[j]` is 'G',
- `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the first 'S' character encountered while iterating from `i - 1` towards the beginning of `s`,
- `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.


The code increments the `beauty` variable by 1. The `beauty` variable initially counts the 'G' characters from `i` to the first 'S' character encountered while iterating from `i - 1` towards the beginning of `s`. After the increment, `beauty` will be one more than this count.


Since none of the other variables (`n`, `s`, `golden`, `max_beauty`, `curr_beauty`, `left`, `right`, `max_beauty_one_swap`, `i`, `j`) are modified by the given code snippet, their states remain unchanged.


Therefore, considering all information provided and the change caused by the increment of `beauty`, the output state after executing the code is:


Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and 1, `i` is greater than 1 and less than `n - 1`, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is the index of the first 'S' character encountered while iterating from `i - 1` towards the beginning of `s`, or `-1` if no 'S' character is found, however the current value of `s[j]` is 'G', `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the first 'S' character encountered while iterating from `i - 1` towards the beginning of `s` plus 1, and `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.**
