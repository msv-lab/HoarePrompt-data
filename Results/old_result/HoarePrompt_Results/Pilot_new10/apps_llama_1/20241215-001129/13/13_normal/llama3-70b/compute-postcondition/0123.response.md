The code updates the value of `max_beauty_one_swap` to be the maximum of its current value and `beauty`. The value of `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the first 'S' character encountered while iterating from `i + 2` towards the end of `s`, or the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the end of `s` if no 'S' character is found. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), 
`s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, 
`golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, 
`max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, 
`curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, 
`left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, 
`right` equals `n`, 
`max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and `beauty`, 
`i` is greater than 1 and less than `n - 1`, 
`s[i]` is 'G', 
`s[i + 1]` is 'S', 
`j` is `n`, 
and `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the first 'S' character encountered while iterating from `i + 2` towards the end of `s`, or the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the end of `s` if no 'S' character is found.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and `beauty`, `i` is greater than 1 and less than `n - 1`, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is `n`, and `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the first 'S' character encountered while iterating from `i + 2` towards the end of `s`, or the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the end of `s` if no 'S' character is found.**
