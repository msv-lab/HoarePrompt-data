The code provided is a `break` statement, which means it will exit the most internal loop it is currently inside. This does not change any variable values but affects the control flow of the program.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive),
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters,
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`,
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`,
- `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`,
- `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character,
- `right` equals `n`,
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and 1,
- `i` is greater than 1 and less than `n - 1`,
- `s[i]` is 'G',
- `s[i + 1]` is 'S',
- `j` is `i + 4`,
- `n` must be greater than `i + 4`.

After executing the `break` statement, we exit the innermost loop but do not change any variable's value. Thus, the output state remains the same as the initial state, with the understanding that we have broken out of the innermost loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and 1, `i` is greater than 1 and less than `n - 1`, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is `i + 4`, `n` is greater than `i + 4`, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
