To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues as long as `left < right` and `s[left]!= 'G'`. This means the loop will stop when it encounters a 'G' in the string `s` or when `left` is no longer less than `right`.

2. **Variable Updates**: Inside the loop, `left` is incremented by 1 in each iteration until it finds a 'G' or reaches the end of the string (`left >= right`).

3. **Initial and Output State Analysis**:
   - **`n`**: Remains unchanged as it's the length of the string `s`.
   - **`s`**: The string itself doesn't change; it's just being traversed.
   - **`golden`**: Initially, it's a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`. The output states after loop executions don't directly modify `golden` but imply that the loop's progression is influenced by the presence of 'G' in `s`.
   - **`curr_beauty` and `max_beauty`**: Both are initialized to 0 and do not change within the provided loop, suggesting their modification might be part of a larger program not shown here.
   - **`right`**: Remains unchanged as it's the last index plus one of the string `s`.
   - **`left`**: This is the variable that changes with each iteration. It starts at 0 (not explicitly mentioned but implied as it increments until it finds a 'G' or reaches `right`).

Given the information, the loop essentially moves the `left` pointer until it finds the first 'G' in the string `s` or reaches the end of the string. 

The output state after the loop executes is therefore:
- **`n`** remains between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive).
- **`s`** remains a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters.
- **`golden`** remains a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- **`curr_beauty`** and **`max_beauty`** remain 0, as their updates are not shown in the provided loop.
- **`right`** is the last index plus one of `s`.
- **`left`** is either the index of the first 'G' encountered in `s` (if one exists) or equals `right` if no 'G' is found or the loop reaches the end of the string.

Therefore, the output state of the loop is:
Output State: **`n` is between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is 0, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` is the last index plus one of `s`, and `left` equals either the index of the first 'G' in `s` or `right` if no 'G' is found or the end of `s` is reached.**
