The value of `i` is incremented by 1. Initially, `i` was 0, so now `i` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still an integer greater than or equal to 2, `trophies` is still a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is still an empty list, and `start` is still 0. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S', `segments` is an empty list, `i` is 1, `start` is 0**
