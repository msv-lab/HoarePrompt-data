Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `trophies` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'G' and 'S'. If the character at index 0 in `trophies` is 'G', then `i` is the index of the first 'S' in the `trophies` string or `n` if the string consists entirely of 'G's, `start` is 0, and `segments` is a list containing the tuple `(0, i - 1)`. Otherwise, `i` is 1, and the character at index 0 in `trophies` is 'S', `segments` remains an empty list.**
