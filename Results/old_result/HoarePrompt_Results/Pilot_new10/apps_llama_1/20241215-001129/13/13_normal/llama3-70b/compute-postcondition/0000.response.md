The input is a string of length n, where n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), and a list of n characters where each character is either 'G' (representing a golden trophy) or 'S' (representing a silver trophy). The code `n = int(input())` assigns the value of the input integer to the variable `n`. However, the input integer is not explicitly specified, so `n` is assigned the value of an input integer.

The states of the other variables are not affected. The input string and the list of characters are still valid, and their properties are unchanged.

Output State: **The input is a string of length n, where n is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), and a list of n characters where each character is either 'G' (representing a golden trophy) or 'S' (representing a silver trophy), `n` is an input integer**.
