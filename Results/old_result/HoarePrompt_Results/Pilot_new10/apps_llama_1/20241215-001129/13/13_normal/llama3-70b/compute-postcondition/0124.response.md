Postcondition: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, if `s[i]` is 'G' and `s[i + 1]` is 'S', then `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and `beauty`, where `beauty` is the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the first 'S' character encountered while iterating from `i + 2` towards the end of `s`, or the count of 'G' characters from `i` to the end of `s` if no 'S' character is found, otherwise `max_beauty_one_swap` remains unchanged, and `i` is greater than 1 and less than `n - 1`.**
