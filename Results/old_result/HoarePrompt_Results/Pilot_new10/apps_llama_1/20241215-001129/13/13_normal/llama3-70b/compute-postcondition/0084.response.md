To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than `i + 1`.
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters.
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`.
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`.
- `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`.
- `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character.
- `right` equals `n`.
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is `0`.
- `i` is greater than 0.
- `s[i]` is 'G'.
- `s[i + 1]` is 'S'.
- `j` is `i + 3`.
- If `s[j]` is 'G', then `beauty` is increased by 1 from its previous value, otherwise, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i + 2, n):`

At the end of the previous iteration, `j` is `i + 3`. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1, so `j` becomes `i + 4`.

Since `j` is now `i + 4`, and considering the loop condition, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than `i + 4` because `j` ranges from `i + 2` to `n`, and since `j` has moved to `i + 4`, `n` must accommodate this new value of `j`.

The other variables' states do not directly depend on the loop variable `j` but rather on the loop body's operations, which are not provided. However, we can infer that since `s[j]` (where `j` is `i + 3`) being 'G' or not affects the `beauty` calculation, at the next iteration, we're considering `s[j]` where `j` is `i + 4`.

State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive) and greater than `i + 2`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is `0`, `i` is greater than 0, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` is `i + 4`**
