Postcondition: **`n` remains the original value, `s` remains the original string, `golden` remains the list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is 0, `right` remains its original value, `left` is either the index of the first 'G' character in `s` from the left (if such a character exists and is before `right`), or `left` equals `right` (if no 'G' character is found before `right`), and `curr_beauty` is 1 if `left` is less than `right`, otherwise `curr_beauty` remains 0**
