The `break` statement terminates the loop that the program is currently in. Since we are breaking out of the loop, the values of the variables do not change. The Output State remains the same as the Initial State, with the addition that we break out of the most internal loop.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is as previously updated, `i` is greater than 2 and less than `n - 1`, `j` is `i - 3`, if the character at index `j` in string `s` is 'G', then `beauty` is 3, otherwise if we are still in the loop, `beauty` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop.**
