The given code is a `break` statement. This statement will terminate the loop it is currently inside. 

Given the initial state:
- `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive)
- `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters
- `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`
- `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`
- `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`
- `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character
- `right` equals `n`
- `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and 1
- `i` is greater than 1
- `s[i]` is 'G'
- `s[i + 1]` is 'S'
- `j` equals `i - 3`

The `break` statement will exit the loop it is currently inside. The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty` and `curr_beauty`, `curr_beauty` is either 0 or the count of 'G' characters at the end of `s`, `left` is at or past the last 'G' or 'S' character, `right` equals `n`, `max_beauty_one_swap` is the maximum of the previous `max_beauty_one_swap` and 1, `i` is greater than 1, `s[i]` is 'G', `s[i + 1]` is 'S', `j` equals `i - 3`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
