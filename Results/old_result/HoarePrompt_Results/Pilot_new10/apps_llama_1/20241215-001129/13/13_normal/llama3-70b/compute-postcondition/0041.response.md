The variable `curr_beauty` is assigned the value `0`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 10^5 (inclusive), `s` is a string of length `n` with 'G' and 'S' characters, `golden` is a list of indices of 'G' characters in `s`, `curr_beauty` is `0`, `max_beauty` is the maximum of 0 and `curr_beauty` which is `0` since `curr_beauty` is `0`, `right` is the last index plus one.
