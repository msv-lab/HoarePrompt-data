Correctness: **False**.

The given program does not work as expected for all potential cases. For example, if we input `3 4 4`, the program should output `2` because we can distribute the cakes in such a way that each plate has at least 2 pieces of cake (e.g., one plate has 2 pieces of the first cake, one plate has 2 pieces of the second cake, and the last plate has 2 pieces of the first cake and 2 pieces of the second cake is not possible, but 2 plates with 2 pieces of each cake and the last plate with 2 pieces of either cake is possible but this will leave 2 pieces to distribute and the program description allows to have one cake per plate). However, the program outputs `1` because it only checks if it's possible to distribute the cakes so that each plate has at least `x` pieces of cake without considering the optimal way to distribute the cakes.

The problem description asks to maximize the minimum number of pieces on each plate, but the given program does not guarantee to find this maximum value. A correct solution would need to consider all possible ways to distribute the cakes while ensuring that each plate has at least the minimum number of pieces required.

A possible correct solution could involve iterating over all possible values of `x` from the maximum possible down to 1, and checking if it's possible to distribute the cakes so that each plate has at least `x` pieces. The first `x` value for which this is possible would be the maximum possible number of pieces that can be guaranteed on each plate.

Here is a corrected Python program:

```python
def func():
    (n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
    for x in range((a + b) // n, 0, -1):
        if n - (a // x) - (b // x) <= (a % x) + (b % x):
            print(x)
            return

func()
```
This corrected program iterates over all possible values of `x` from the maximum possible down to 1 and checks if it's possible to distribute the cakes so that each plate has at least `x` pieces. The first `x` value for which this is possible is the maximum possible number of pieces that can be guaranteed on each plate.
