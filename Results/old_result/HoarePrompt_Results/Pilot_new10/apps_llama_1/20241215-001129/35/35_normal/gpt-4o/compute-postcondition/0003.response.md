Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of plates, `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. The initial values of `low` is 1, `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`, and `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`. The current value of `mid` is such that it is possible to distribute the cakes with this value, as indicated by the function `can_distribute(mid)` returning True.**
