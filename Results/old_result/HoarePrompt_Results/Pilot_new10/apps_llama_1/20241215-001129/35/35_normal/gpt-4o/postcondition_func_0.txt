The function accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of plates and `a` and `b` are the number of pieces of two cakes, and returns a value one less than the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed into `n` plates, given the original values of `a`, `b`, and `n`, assuming that `n` is between 2 and `a + b` (inclusive) and `a` and `b` are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and the distribution is possible according to the `can_distribute(mid)` function
