You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: It's New Year's Eve soon, so Ivan decided it's high time he started setting the table. Ivan has bought two cakes and cut them into pieces: the first cake has been cut into a pieces, and the second one — into b pieces.

Ivan knows that there will be n people at the celebration (including himself), so Ivan has set n plates for the cakes. Now he is thinking about how to distribute the cakes between the plates. Ivan wants to do it in such a way that all following conditions are met:  Each piece of each cake is put on some plate;  Each plate contains at least one piece of cake;  No plate contains pieces of both cakes. 

To make his guests happy, Ivan wants to distribute the cakes in such a way that the minimum number of pieces on the plate is maximized. Formally, Ivan wants to know the maximum possible number x such that he can distribute the cakes according to the aforementioned conditions, and each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.

Help Ivan to calculate this number x!


-----Input-----

The first line contains three integers n, a and b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100, 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b) — the number of plates, the number of pieces of the first cake, and the number of pieces of the second cake, respectively.


-----Output-----

Print the maximum possible number x such that Ivan can distribute the cake in such a way that each plate will contain at least x pieces of cake.


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2 3

Output
1

Input
4 7 10

Output
3



-----Note-----

In the first example there is only one way to distribute cakes to plates, all of them will have 1 cake on it.

In the second example you can have two plates with 3 and 4 pieces of the first cake and two plates both with 5 pieces of the second cake. Minimal number of pieces is 3.
Program:
```
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, a, b))

def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, min(a, b) + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

def can_distribute(x):
    return a // x + b // x >= n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The problem in the code lies in the implementation of the `can_distribute` function. This function checks if it is possible to distribute the cakes into at least `n` plates such that each plate has at least `x` pieces of cake. However, the current implementation only checks if the total number of plates that can be filled with at least `x` pieces of cake is greater than or equal to `n`, but it does not consider whether the remaining pieces of cake can be distributed to fill the remaining plates.

For example, if `n = 5`, `a = 7`, `b = 4`, and `x = 2`, the function `can_distribute(2)` returns `True` because `a // x + b // x = 7 // 2 + 4 // 2 = 3 + 2 = 5 >= n`. However, this does not take into account the fact that we have 3 plates with 2 pieces of the first cake and 2 plates with 2 pieces of the second cake, leaving 1 piece of the first cake and 0 pieces of the second cake undistributed, which means we cannot actually fill 5 plates with at least 2 pieces of cake each.

This can be fixed by modifying the `can_distribute` function to check whether the remaining pieces of cake after filling the plates with `x` pieces of cake can be distributed to fill the remaining plates. 

Here is a correct version of the `can_distribute` function:
```python
def can_distribute(x):
    plates_with_a = a // x
    plates_with_b = b // x
    remaining_a = a % x
    remaining_b = b % x
    
    if plates_with_a + plates_with_b > n:
        return False
    
    return plates_with_a + plates_with_b + (1 if remaining_a > 0 else 0) + (1 if remaining_b > 0 else 0) >= n
```
This function first calculates the number of plates that can be filled with `x` pieces of the first cake and the second cake, as well as the remaining pieces of each cake. It then checks if the total number of plates that can be filled with `x` pieces of cake plus the number of plates that can be filled with the remaining pieces of cake is greater than or equal to `n`.

However, there might be more straightforward and simpler ways to solve the problem. 

One of the possible correct versions of the program can be:
```python
(n, a, b) = map(int, input().split())

def func_1(n, a, b):
    (low, high) = (1, max(a, b) // n + 1)

    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if can_distribute(mid):
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid
    return low - 1

def can_distribute(x):
    return (a - 1) // x + 1 + (b - 1) // x + 1 >= n

print(func_1(n, a, b))
```

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts integers `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` is the number of plates and `a` and `b` are the number of pieces of two cakes, and returns a value one less than the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed into `n` plates, given the original values of `a`, `b`, and `n`, assuming that `n` is between 2 and `a + b` (inclusive) and `a` and `b` are between 1 and 100 (inclusive), and the distribution is possible according to the `can_distribute(mid)` function 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts a positive integer x, uses global variables a and b representing the number of pieces of the first and second cakes, and n representing the number of plates, and returns True if the total number of plates that can be filled with cake pieces is greater than or equal to the number of plates n, where the total number of plates is calculated as the integer division of a by x plus the integer division of b by x, and False otherwise, assuming 2 <= n <= a + b and x <= min(a, b) 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
