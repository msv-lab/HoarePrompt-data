Postcondition: **`n` is an integer representing the number of plates, `a` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` is an integer representing the number of pieces of the second cake, such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 100 and 2 ≤ n ≤ a + b. If it is possible to distribute the cakes with the current value of `mid` as indicated by `can_distribute(mid)` returning True, then `low` is `mid + 1` and `high` is `min(a, b) + 1`. Otherwise, if it cannot distribute the cakes with `mid` number of pieces, i.e., `(can_distribute(mid))` is False, then `low` is 1 and `high` is `mid`. In both cases, `mid` is `(min(a, b) + 2) // 2`.**
