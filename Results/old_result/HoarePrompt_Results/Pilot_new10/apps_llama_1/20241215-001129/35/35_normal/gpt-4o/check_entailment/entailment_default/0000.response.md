Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to correctly implement the problem description. The `func_1` function uses a binary search approach to find the maximum number of pieces that can be distributed into `n` plates, given the original values of `a`, `b`, and `n`. The `can_distribute` function checks if it's possible to distribute the cakes into `n` plates with at least `x` pieces per plate.

The output hints for both functions agree with the code and provide a clear understanding of what each function does. The `can_distribute` function uses the formula `a // x + b // x >= n` to check if the total number of plates that can be filled with cake pieces is greater than or equal to the number of plates `n`.

The examples provided in the problem description also support the correctness of the code. For instance, in the first example, the code correctly returns `1` as the maximum possible number of pieces per plate, and in the second example, it correctly returns `3`.

The code handles the edge cases correctly, such as when `n` is equal to `a + b`, or when `a` or `b` is equal to `1`. The binary search approach in `func_1` ensures that the maximum possible number of pieces per plate is found efficiently.

Overall, based on the code, output hints, and examples provided, it seems that the program correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases.
