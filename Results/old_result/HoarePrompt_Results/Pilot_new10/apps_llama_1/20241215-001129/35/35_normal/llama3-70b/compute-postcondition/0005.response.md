Postcondition: ***`n` is the number of people at the celebration, `a` is the number of pieces of the first cake, `b` is the number of pieces of the second cake, `x` is the minimum of `n`, `a`, and `b`. If `a` is greater than or equal to `x`, `b` is greater than or equal to `x`, and the sum of the remaining pieces of both cakes (`a - x + b - x`) is greater than or equal to `x`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement with `a` and `b` both being greater than or equal to `x`. Otherwise, the state of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x` remains as defined in the precondition, but without breaking out of the loop or if statement.***
