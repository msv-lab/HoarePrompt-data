Postcondition: ***`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `node` is the previously removed leftmost element of the `queue`, `count` is 2, `graph[node]` has at least one more neighbor. If `in_degree[neighbor]` is 0, then `queue` is not empty and contains the next `neighbor` and also the current `neighbor`, and `in_degree[neighbor]` is `in_degree[neighbor] - 1`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, as there is no else part to handle other cases.***
