You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

def func_1(n, m, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict, deque

    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
    if not has_cycle(graph):
        return 'YES'
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        graph[u].append(v)
    return 'NO'

def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: 0 for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        count += 1
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return count != n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program attempts to solve the problem by first checking if the directed graph contains a cycle. If it does not, the function immediately returns 'YES'. If it does, the program iterates through each edge in the graph, temporarily removing it and checking if the resulting graph contains a cycle. If removing any edge results in an acyclic graph, the program returns 'YES'. If none of the edges can be removed to make the graph acyclic, the program returns 'NO'.

The `has_cycle` function checks for cycles in the graph by using the topological sorting algorithm. It calculates the in-degree of each node and initializes a queue with nodes having an in-degree of 0. It then iterates through the queue, decreasing the in-degree of neighboring nodes and adding them to the queue if their in-degree becomes 0. If all nodes are processed (i.e., the count of processed nodes equals the number of nodes), the graph is acyclic; otherwise, it contains a cycle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

1.  If the graph is already acyclic, the `has_cycle` function will return `False`, and the program will correctly return 'YES'.
2.  If removing any single edge can make the graph acyclic, the program will find this edge and return 'YES'.
3.  If removing any single edge cannot make the graph acyclic, the program will correctly return 'NO'.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code correctly checks for cycles in the graph, iterates through all edges, and returns the correct result based on whether removing any edge can make the graph acyclic.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

def func_1(n, m, edges):

The graph contains at least one cycle.
    for (u, v) in edges:

        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        
        graph[u].append(v)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop step by step.
    #
    #1. **Loop Iteration**: For each edge `(u, v)` in the `edges` list, the loop removes `v` from the list of destination vertices of `u` in the graph, checks if the graph still has a cycle, and then appends `v` back to the list of destination vertices of `u` in the graph.
    #
    #2. **Effect of Iterations**:
    #   - `n` and `m`: These represent the number of vertices and edges, respectively. They do not change within the loop.
    #   - `edges`: This list of edges is iterated over but not modified in terms of its length or content. Each edge is processed once.
    #   - `u` and `v`: These variables take on the values of the source and destination vertices of each edge as the loop iterates over the `edges` list.
    #   - `graph`: The graph structure is temporarily modified (by removing and then adding back an edge) during each iteration, but at the end of each iteration, it returns to its original state (before the loop started) because `v` is appended back to `graph[u]`.
    #   - `has_cycle(graph)`: This function checks if the graph contains a cycle. The loop's behavior depends on this check, but since it's not the focus of determining the output state's variable values, we acknowledge its role in controlling the loop's flow but focus on variable states.
    #
    #3. **After All Iterations**:
    #   - `n` remains an integer representing the number of vertices.
    #   - `m` remains an integer representing the number of edges.
    #   - `edges` remains a list of tuples representing all edges.
    #   - `u` and `v` will hold the values of the source and destination vertices of the last edge processed.
    #   - `graph` returns to its original state after all iterations because each edge removed is added back.
    #
    #Considering the loop's behavior:
    #- If the graph does not contain a cycle after removing any edge, the function returns 'YES' and the loop does not continue.
    #- However, the question asks for the state after all iterations, implying we consider the scenario where the loop completes normally (without returning early) or when the conditions are such that it does not early return.
    #
    #**Output State**: **`n` is an integer representing the number of vertices, `m` is an integer representing the number of edges, `edges` is a list of tuples, `u` is the source vertex of the last edge, `v` is the destination vertex of the last edge, and `graph` is a defaultdict of lists representing the original graph structure with all edges intact, assuming no early return due to the absence of a cycle. If the graph originally contained at least one cycle, this characteristic is maintained unless an early return occurred.**
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns the string 'NO', indicating the presence of a cycle in the graph after all iterations have completed, with `n` being an integer representing the number of vertices, `m` being an integer representing the number of edges, `edges` being a list of tuples representing all edges, `u` being the source vertex of the last edge, `v` being the destination vertex of the last edge, and `graph` being a defaultdict of lists representing the original graph structure with all edges intact.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: graph is a dictionary representing a directed graph where each key is a node (integer), the value for each key is a list of its neighboring nodes (integers), and n is a positive integer representing the number of nodes in the graph such that 1 <= n <= 500.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
