The code removes the leftmost node from the `queue` and assigns it to the variable `node`. The state of the other variables is not affected. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` must have at least one key with a value of 0, `queue` is one node shorter, `count` is 0, `node` is the leftmost node that was in `queue`**
