The value of `in_degree[v]` is increased by 1. The initial state of `in_degree[v]` was the value for at least one key `v` increased by 1, so now `in_degree[v]` is increased by 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph that must have at least one node, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` is a dictionary where each key is a node from 1 to `n` and the value for at least one key `v` is increased by 2, `u` is a node in `graph` that must have at least two neighbors**
