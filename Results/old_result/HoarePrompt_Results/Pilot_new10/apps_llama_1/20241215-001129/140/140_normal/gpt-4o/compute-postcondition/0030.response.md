The code increments the `count` variable by 1. The initial state of `count` is 0, so after the increment operation, `count` becomes 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`graph` is a dictionary representing a directed graph, `n` is a positive integer, `in_degree` must have at least one key with a value of 0, `queue` is one node shorter, `count` is 1, `node` is the leftmost node that was in `queue`**
