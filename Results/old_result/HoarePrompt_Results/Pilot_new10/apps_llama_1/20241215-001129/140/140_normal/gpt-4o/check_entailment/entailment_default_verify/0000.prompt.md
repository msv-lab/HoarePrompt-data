You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a directed graph consisting of n vertices and m edges (each edge is directed, so it can be traversed in only one direction). You are allowed to remove at most one edge from it.

Can you make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge from it? A directed graph is called acyclic iff it doesn't contain any cycle (a non-empty path that starts and ends in the same vertex).


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and m (2 ≤ n ≤ 500, 1 ≤ m ≤ min(n(n - 1), 100000)) — the number of vertices and the number of edges, respectively.

Then m lines follow. Each line contains two integers u and v denoting a directed edge going from vertex u to vertex v (1 ≤ u, v ≤ n, u ≠ v). Each ordered pair (u, v) is listed at most once (there is at most one directed edge from u to v).


-----Output-----

If it is possible to make this graph acyclic by removing at most one edge, print YES. Otherwise, print NO.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 4
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1

Output
YES

Input
5 6
1 2
2 3
3 2
3 1
2 1
4 5

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first example you can remove edge $2 \rightarrow 3$, and the graph becomes acyclic.

In the second example you have to remove at least two edges (for example, $2 \rightarrow 1$ and $2 \rightarrow 3$) in order to make the graph acyclic.
Program:
```
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
data = input().split()
n = int(data[0])
m = int(data[1])
edges = [(int(data[i]), int(data[i + 1])) for i in range(2, len(data), 2)]
result = func_1(n, m, edges)
print(result)

def func_1(n, m, edges):
    from collections import defaultdict, deque

    graph = defaultdict(list)
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].append(v)
    if not has_cycle(graph):
        return 'YES'
    for (u, v) in edges:
        graph[u].remove(v)
        if not has_cycle(graph):
            return 'YES'
        graph[u].append(v)
    return 'NO'

def has_cycle(graph):
    in_degree = {i: 0 for i in range(1, n + 1)}
    for u in graph:
        for v in graph[u]:
            in_degree[v] += 1
    queue = deque([node for node in in_degree if in_degree[node] == 0])
    count = 0
    while queue:
        node = queue.popleft()
        count += 1
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            in_degree[neighbor] -= 1
            if in_degree[neighbor] == 0:
                queue.append(neighbor)
    return count != n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program attempts to solve the problem by first checking if the directed graph contains a cycle. If it does not, the function immediately returns 'YES'. If it does, the program iterates through each edge in the graph, temporarily removing it and checking if the resulting graph contains a cycle. If removing any edge results in an acyclic graph, the program returns 'YES'. If none of the edges can be removed to make the graph acyclic, the program returns 'NO'.

The `has_cycle` function checks for cycles in the graph by using the topological sorting algorithm. It calculates the in-degree of each node and initializes a queue with nodes having an in-degree of 0. It then iterates through the queue, decreasing the in-degree of neighboring nodes and adding them to the queue if their in-degree becomes 0. If all nodes are processed (i.e., the count of processed nodes equals the number of nodes), the graph is acyclic; otherwise, it contains a cycle.

The program correctly handles all possible cases:

1.  If the graph is already acyclic, the `has_cycle` function will return `False`, and the program will correctly return 'YES'.
2.  If removing any single edge can make the graph acyclic, the program will find this edge and return 'YES'.
3.  If removing any single edge cannot make the graph acyclic, the program will correctly return 'NO'.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The code correctly checks for cycles in the graph, iterates through all edges, and returns the correct result based on whether removing any edge can make the graph acyclic.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts parameters `n` (number of vertices), `m` (number of edges), and `edges` (list of directed edges), and returns 'YES' if the graph is cycle-free or if removing any single edge makes it cycle-free; otherwise, it returns 'NO', indicating the presence of a cycle that cannot be removed by deleting a single edge. 

Output hint for function_2: The function accepts a dictionary representing a directed graph and the number of nodes, and returns True if there are nodes in the graph not reachable from nodes with an in-degree of 0, indicating a potential cycle, and False otherwise, suggesting the graph is a Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG). 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
