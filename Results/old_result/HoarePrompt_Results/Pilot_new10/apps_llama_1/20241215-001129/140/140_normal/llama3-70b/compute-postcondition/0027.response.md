The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `node`, `graph`, `visited`, and `rec_stack`. `node` is an integer representing a vertex in the graph, `graph` is a dictionary or list representing the adjacency list of the directed graph, and `visited` and `rec_stack` are lists or dictionaries of boolean values representing whether each vertex has been visited and whether each vertex is in the recursion stack, respectively. 

The function returns a boolean value based on the state of the graph and the parameters. Specifically, the function returns `True` under various conditions related to the presence of cycles in the graph, including when a node has been visited and is in the recursion stack, or when its neighbors have been visited and are in the recursion stack. 

The function also returns `True` when a node has at least two or three neighbors and has been visited and is in the recursion stack. Additionally, the function returns `False` under certain conditions. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `node`, a graph representation `graph`, and boolean lists or dictionaries `visited` and `rec_stack`, and return a boolean value indicating the presence or absence of a cycle in the graph based on the visited and recursion stack status of the node and its neighbors.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters node, graph, visited, and rec_stack, and returns a boolean value indicating the presence of a cycle in the graph.**
