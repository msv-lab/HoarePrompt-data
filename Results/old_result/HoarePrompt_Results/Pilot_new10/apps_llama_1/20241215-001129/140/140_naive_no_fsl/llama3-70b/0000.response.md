Correctness: **False**

The given code checks if a directed graph contains a cycle and prints 'NO' if it does, and 'YES' otherwise. However, the question asks to check if it is possible to make the graph acyclic by removing at most one edge. The given code does not handle this correctly. It only checks if the original graph is acyclic.

For example, consider the case where there are two cycles in the graph, but both cycles share an edge. In this case, removing that shared edge would make the graph acyclic, but the given code would print 'NO' because it doesn't check the possibility of removing an edge.

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

Input:
```
4 4
1 2
2 3
3 4
4 1
```
In this case, the graph has a cycle (1 -> 2 -> 3 -> 4 -> 1), but removing the edge 4 -> 1 makes it acyclic. However, the program will print 'NO' because it doesn't check the possibility of removing an edge to make the graph acyclic. 

To fix this, the program should check for all edges in the graph if removing them makes the graph acyclic, which is not implemented in the given code. 

Here is a simple example of what could be done instead:

```python
def has_cycle(graph, edge_to_remove):
    visited = [False] * len(graph)
    rec_stack = [False] * len(graph)

    def dfs(node):
        visited[node] = True
        rec_stack[node] = True
        for neighbor in graph[node]:
            if (node, neighbor) == edge_to_remove or (neighbor, node) == edge_to_remove:
                continue
            if not visited[neighbor]:
                if dfs(neighbor):
                    return True
            elif rec_stack[neighbor]:
                return True
        rec_stack[node] = False
        return False

    for node in range(len(graph)):
        if not visited[node]:
            if dfs(node):
                return True
    return False

def solve():
    (n, m) = map(int, input().split())
    graph = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    edges = []
    for _ in range(m):
        (u, v) = map(int, input().split())
        u -= 1
        v -= 1
        graph[u].append(v)
        edges.append((u, v))

    for edge in edges:
        if not has_cycle(graph, edge):
            print("YES")
            return
    print("NO")

solve()
```

This code checks for all edges in the graph if removing them makes the graph acyclic, and prints 'YES' if it finds such an edge, and 'NO' otherwise.
