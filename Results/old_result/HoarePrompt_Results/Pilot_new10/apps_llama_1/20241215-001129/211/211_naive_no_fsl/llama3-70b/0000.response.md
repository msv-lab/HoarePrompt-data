Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when there are multiple possible splits of the array. According to the problem description, if there are multiple answers, any of them should be printed. However, the given program does not correctly implement this. 

For example, if the input is:
```
5
1 -2 3 1 -3
```
The program will not print the correct output. The correct output should be:
```
YES
1
1 5
```
But the program will not print this. 

Also, there is an issue in the provided code when printing the segments. It should print two integers `l_i` and `r_i` for each segment, but the code is printing three values `k`, `l`, and `r`. 

Here's the corrected version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = list(map(int, input().split()))
    prefix_sum = [0] * (n + 1)
    for i in range(n):
        prefix_sum[i + 1] = prefix_sum[i] + a[i]
    if prefix_sum[n] == 0:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        segments = []
        start = 0
        for end in range(n):
            if prefix_sum[end + 1]!= 0 and (end == n - 1 or prefix_sum[end + 2]!= 0):
                segments.append((start + 1, end + 1))
                start = end + 1
        print(len(segments))
        for segment in segments:
            print(segment[0], segment[1])

func()
```
