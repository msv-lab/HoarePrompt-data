To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `r` is less than `n + 1`. At the end of the previous iteration, `r` is 1 and `n` must be greater than 1, since `r` has already executed once. So, for the loop to execute again, `r` must be incremented by 1, making it 2, and `n` must be greater than 1 to ensure the loop can execute at least one more time.

State: **`A` has a length of `n` where `n` must be greater than 1, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements up to index `i-1` in `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `prefix_sum` does not contain all zeros, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed. If `prefix_sum` at index `r` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum` at index `n`, then `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 2, and the values 2, 1, 2 have been printed for `k`, `l`, `r` respectively. Otherwise, `k` remains 1, `l` remains 1, `r` is 2.**
