The code creates a new list `prefix_sum` with a length of `n + 1`, where `n` is the input integer. The list `prefix_sum` is initialized with all elements being 0. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **The list `A` has a length of `n`, where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and each element in `A` is an integer such that -10^3 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^3 for 1 ≤ i ≤ `n`, and a new list `a` is created with the same length as the number of input integers and contains the input integers, and `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements being 0.**
