Postcondition: **`A` has a length of `n` where `n` must be greater than 0, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements up to index `i-1` in `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `prefix_sum` does not contain all zeros, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed, `k` is 1, `l` is 1, the current value of `r` is 1, and the value of `prefix_sum` at index `r` is not equal to 0 and not equal to the value of `prefix_sum` at index `n`.**
