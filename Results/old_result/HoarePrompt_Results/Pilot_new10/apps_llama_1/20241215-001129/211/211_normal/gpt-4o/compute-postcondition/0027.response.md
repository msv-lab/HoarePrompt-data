To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive)
- `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3
- `total_sum` equals 0
- `i` is 2
- 'YES' has been printed
- '2' has been printed
- '1' has been printed
- '3' has been printed

The code snippet is:
```python
print(i + 2, n)
```

This code prints the value of `i + 2` and `n`. Given that `i` is 2, `i + 2` will be 4.

The output of the print statement will be the pair `(4, n)`, where `n` is the current value of `n`, an integer between 3 and 100.

Since `n` can be any integer between 3 and 100, and we don't have a specific value for `n`, we cannot determine a specific output value for `n`. However, we can state that the number 4 and the value of `n` have been printed.

The values of `A`, `total_sum`, `i`, and the fact that 'YES', '2', '1', and '3' have been printed are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is: 
- `n` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive)
- `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3
- `total_sum` equals 0
- `i` is 2
- 'YES' has been printed
- '2' has been printed
- '1' has been printed
- '3' has been printed
- The numbers 4 and `n` have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 3 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 2, 'YES' has been printed, '2' has been printed, '1' has been printed, '3' has been printed, and the numbers 4 and `n` have been printed**
