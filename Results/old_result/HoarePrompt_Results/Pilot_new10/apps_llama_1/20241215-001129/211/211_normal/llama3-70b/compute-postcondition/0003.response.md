According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n` and `i`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the list `A` has a length of `n`, and `a` is also created with the same length as the number of input integers, and `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements being 0. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, and `i` is now 0.
State: **`A` has a length of `n` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements being 0, `n` must be greater than 0, `i` is 0**
