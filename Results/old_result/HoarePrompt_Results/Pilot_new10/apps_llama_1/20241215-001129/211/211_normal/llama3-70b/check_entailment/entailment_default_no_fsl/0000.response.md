Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires the program to split the array into several parts such that the sum of elements in each part is not zero, and the parts should be contiguous and non-overlapping. However, the given code does not correctly implement this requirement.

One example where the code fails is when the input is:
```
3
1 -1 1
```
The code will output:
```
YES
1 1 1
2 3
```
However, this is not a correct solution because the sum of the second part (containing only the element -1) is zero, which is not allowed according to the problem description.

Another example where the code fails is when the input is:
```
4
1 2 3 -6
```
The code will not correctly split the array into parts with non-zero sums.

The code has several issues, including:

1. It does not correctly handle the case where the sum of a part is zero.
2. It does not ensure that the parts are contiguous and non-overlapping.
3. It does not correctly output the indices of the parts.

To fix these issues, the code needs to be revised to correctly implement the requirements of the problem description. This may involve using a different approach to split the array into parts, such as using a greedy algorithm or dynamic programming.
