`prefix_sum[i + 1]` is assigned the value `prefix_sum[i] + a[i]`. Given that `i` is 1, `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`, and `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[2]` is assigned the value `prefix_sum[1] + a[1]` which is `a[0] + a[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `A` has a length of `n` where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_sum[0]` is 0, `prefix_sum[1]` is `a[0]`, `prefix_sum[2]` is `a[0] + a[1]`, and the rest of the elements are 0.
