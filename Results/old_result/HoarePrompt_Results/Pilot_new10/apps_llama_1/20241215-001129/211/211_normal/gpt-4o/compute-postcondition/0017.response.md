The code snippet `print('YES')` simply prints the string 'YES' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, or `i`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` must be greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 1, and 'YES' has been printed to the console**
