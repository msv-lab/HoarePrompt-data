The function `func` accepts no parameters and reads input from the console. It first reads an integer `n` representing the length of a list of integers, then reads `n` integers and stores them in a list `a`. The function calculates the prefix sum of the list `a` and stores it in a list `prefix_sum`. 

If the total sum of the list `a` (i.e., `prefix_sum[n]`) is zero, the function prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it prints 'YES' and then prints the indices `k`, `l`, and `r` for each prefix sum that is non-zero and not equal to the total sum, as well as the final indices `k`, `l`, and `n`. 

However, there are potential edge cases and missing logic. For example, the function does not handle cases where the input `n` is not an integer or is outside the range of 1 to 100, or where the integers in the list `a` are not within the range of -10^3 to 10^3. Additionally, the function does not check if the input list `a` has exactly `n` integers.

The functionality of the function is to read a list of integers from the console, calculate the prefix sum, and print 'NO' if the total sum is zero. If the total sum is non-zero, it prints 'YES' and the indices of non-zero prefix sums that are not equal to the total sum, as well as the final indices.

Functionality: ** The function reads a list of integers from the console, calculates the prefix sum, and prints 'NO' if the total sum is zero. If the total sum is non-zero, it prints 'YES' and the indices of non-zero prefix sums that are not equal to the total sum, as well as the final indices, but does not handle invalid inputs and may produce unexpected results for edge cases. **
