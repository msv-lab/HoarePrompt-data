Postcondition: ***`A` has a length of `n` where `n` must be greater than 1, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements up to index `i-1` in `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `prefix_sum` does not contain all zeros, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed. If `prefix_sum` at index `r` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum` at index `n`, then `k` is either 2 or 3, `l` is equal to `r` and `l` and `r` are either 1 or 2. Otherwise, `k` remains 1, `l` remains 1, and `r` is 2.***
