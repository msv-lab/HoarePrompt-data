The provided code snippet simply prints the string '2' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, or `i`. The state of the variables remains unchanged, but the console output now includes '2' in addition to 'YES'.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 1, 'YES' and '2' have been printed to the console**
