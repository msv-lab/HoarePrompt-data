Postcondition: ***`A` has a length of `n` where `n` must be greater than 0, `a` has the same length as the number of input integers, `prefix_sum` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element at index `i` is the sum of all elements up to index `i-1` in `a`, `i` is `n-1`, `prefix_sum` does not contain all zeros, the sum of all elements in `a` is not equal to 0, 'YES' has been printed. If `prefix_sum` at index `r` is not equal to 0 and not equal to `prefix_sum` at index `n`, then `k` is 2, `l` is 1, `r` is 1, and the values 2, 1, 1 have been printed for `k`, `l`, `r` respectively. Otherwise, `k` remains 1, `l` remains 1, `r` remains 1.***
