Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description. The problem description requires that if it is not possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, print single line containing "NO" (without quotes). However, the given program does not handle this case correctly.

In the annotated program, when `total_sum` equals 0, the program checks for a non-zero element in the list `A`. If a non-zero element is found, it prints 'YES' along with specific information. However, if all elements in `A` are 0, the program does not print anything, which is incorrect according to the problem description. It should print "NO" in this case.

To fix this, the program should add an `else` block after the `for` loop to handle the case when all elements in `A` are 0. Here is an example of the corrected code:
```python
if (total_sum!= 0) :
    print('YES')
    print('1')
    print('1', n)
else :
    for i in range(n):
        if A[i]!= 0:
            print('YES')
            print('2')
            print('1', i + 1)
            print(i + 2, n)
            break
    else:
        print('NO')
```
This corrected code will print "NO" when all elements in `A` are 0, which is in accordance with the problem description.
