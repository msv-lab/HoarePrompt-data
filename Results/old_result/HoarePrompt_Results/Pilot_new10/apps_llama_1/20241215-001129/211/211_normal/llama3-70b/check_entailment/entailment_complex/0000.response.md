Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description for several reasons:

1. The program prints the number of subarrays and their indices incorrectly. According to the problem description, the program should print the number of new arrays (`k`) and then print two integers (`l_i` and `r_i`) denoting the subarray `A[l_i... r_i]` of the initial array `A` being the `i`-th new array. However, the program prints `k` and the indices `l` and `r` together in a single line, which does not match the required output format.

2. The program does not handle the case where the total sum of the array is non-zero, but there is no non-zero prefix sum that is not equal to the total sum. In this case, the program should print the entire array as a single subarray, but it does not handle this case correctly.

3. The program does not check if the sum of elements in each subarray is non-zero, which is a requirement of the problem description. It only checks if the prefix sum is non-zero and not equal to the total sum, but it does not verify that the sum of elements in each subarray is non-zero.

4. The program does not print the final indices correctly. According to the problem description, if there are multiple answers, the program can print any of them. However, the program prints the final indices as `k, l, n`, which does not match the required output format.

Here is an example where the program does not follow the problem description:

Input:
```
4
1 2 3 -5
```
Expected output:
```
YES
4
1 1
2 2
3 3
4 4
```
Actual output:
```
YES
1 1 1
2 1 4
```
As you can see, the program does not print the number of subarrays and their indices correctly, and it does not verify that the sum of elements in each subarray is non-zero. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description.
