Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the code checks if the total sum of the array is non-zero. If it is, the code prints 'YES' along with the entire array as a single subarray. However, this approach does not consider the requirement that the sum of elements in each of the new subarrays must be non-zero.

The code attempts to handle the case where all elements are 0 or the sum of the array is 0 by checking for non-zero elements in the array. However, if all elements are 0, the code will not print 'NO' as required by the problem description. Instead, it will not print anything, as the only print statement in the else block is inside the for loop.

Additionally, the code does not correctly handle cases where the array can be split into multiple subarrays, each with a non-zero sum. For example, if the input array is [1, 2, -3, 4, -4, 5], the code will not be able to correctly split the array into subarrays with non-zero sums.

Overall, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and therefore its correctness is **False**.
