According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive). For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 1. The loop can execute again as long as `n` is greater than 1.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive) and `n` must be greater than 1, `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 1**
