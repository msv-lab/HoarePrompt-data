To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial conditions step by step.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive).
   - `A` is a list of `n` integers, each in the range -10^3 to 10^3.

2. **Code Analysis**:
   - The code calculates the sum of all elements in list `A` and assigns this sum to the variable `total_sum`.

3. **Impact on the Program**:
   - The value of `total_sum` is directly dependent on the values in list `A`. Since each element in `A` can range from -10^3 to 10^3, the minimum possible sum for `n` elements would be `-10^3 * n` (if all elements are -10^3), and the maximum possible sum would be `10^3 * n` (if all elements are 10^3).
   - Given that `n` is between 1 and 100, the minimum possible sum (`total_sum`) would be `-10^3` (when `n = 1`), and the maximum possible sum would be `10^5` (when `n = 100` and each element is 10^3).

4. **Output State**:
   - `n` remains an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), as its value does not change.
   - `A` remains a list of `n` integers, each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, since the code does not modify `A`.
   - `total_sum` is assigned a value that is the sum of all elements in `A`, ranging from `-10^3 * n` to `10^3 * n`, which simplifies to a range from `-10^5` (for `n = 100` and all elements being -10^3) to `10^5` (for `n = 100` and all elements being 10^3).

Given the analysis, the output state is that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, and `total_sum` is an integer ranging from `-10^5` to `10^5`, equal to the sum of all elements in `A`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, and `total_sum` equals the sum of all elements in `A`, ranging from `-10^5` to `10^5`.**
