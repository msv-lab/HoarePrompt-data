The `break` statement is used to exit a loop or a switch statement. In this case, since there is no loop or switch statement provided in the given code snippet, we will consider the impact of the `break` statement in a general sense.

The `break` statement will exit the most internal loop or conditional statement it is directly inside. However, since we don't have the surrounding code, we can only state its general effect.

Given the initial state:

- `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive)
- `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3
- `total_sum` equals 0
- `i` is 1
- 'YES', '2', '1', 2, 3, and `n` have been printed to the console

And considering the `break` statement:

- It will break out of the most internal loop or conditional statement it is directly inside.

The values of `n`, `A`, `total_sum`, `i`, and the print statements to the console do not change because of the `break` statement. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 1, 'YES', '2', '1', 2, 3, and `n` have been printed to the console, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `A` is a list of `n` integers each in the range -10^3 to 10^3, `total_sum` equals 0, `i` is 1, 'YES', '2', '1', 2, 3, and `n` have been printed to the console, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
