Correctness: **False**.

The provided Python function does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. The main issue with the function is that it only handles two scenarios: when the total sum of the array is not zero and when the array has a single non-zero element. However, the problem requires splitting the array into multiple subarrays, each with a non-zero sum.

For example, if the input is:

```
4
1 2 1 -4
```

The function will not be able to correctly split the array into multiple subarrays with non-zero sums. The correct output should be:

```
YES
3
1 1
2 2
3 4
```

But the provided function will not produce this output. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and its correctness is **False**. 

To fix this function, it needs to be modified to handle all possible scenarios and correctly split the array into multiple subarrays with non-zero sums. This can be achieved by iterating over the array, calculating the sum of each subarray, and splitting the array whenever a subarray with a non-zero sum is found. 

Here's a possible way to implement this:

```python
def func():
    n = int(input())
    A = list(map(int, input().split()))
    result = []
    temp = []
    temp_sum = 0
    for i, num in enumerate(A):
        temp.append(i + 1)
        temp_sum += num
        if temp_sum!= 0:
            result.append(temp)
            temp = []
            temp_sum = 0
    if temp:
        print('NO')
    else:
        print('YES')
        print(len(result))
        for subarray in result:
            print(subarray[0], subarray[-1])

func()
```
