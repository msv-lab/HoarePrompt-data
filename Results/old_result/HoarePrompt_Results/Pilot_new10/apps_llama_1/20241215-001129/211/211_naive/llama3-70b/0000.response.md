Correctness: **False**.

The issue with the provided program is that it does not correctly handle the output format specified in the problem description. According to the description, if it is possible to split the array A and satisfy all the constraints, the program should first print "YES", followed by the number of new arrays k, and then for each new array, it should print two integers l and r which denote the subarray A[l... r] of the initial array A being the i-th new array.

However, the provided program does not follow this format. Specifically, it prints the number of new arrays k along with the indices l and r, which is not in line with the required output format. Furthermore, the logic used to determine the subarrays also seems incorrect, as it only checks for non-zero prefix sums that are not equal to the total sum of the array, which may not be sufficient to ensure that the sum of elements in each new array is not zero.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
1 2 -3
```
The program will output:
```
YES
1 1 1
2 2 3
```
Which is not the correct output format. The correct output should be:
```
YES
2
1 2
3 3
```
This indicates that the program does not work as expected for this case, making its correctness **False**.
