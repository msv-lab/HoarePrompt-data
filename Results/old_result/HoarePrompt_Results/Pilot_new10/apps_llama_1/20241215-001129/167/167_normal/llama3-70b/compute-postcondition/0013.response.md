`nx` and `ny` are assigned the values of `(v - 1) // y` and `(v - 1) % y` respectively. Given that `px` is `(v - 1) // y` and `py` is `(v - 1) % y`, and `nx` is `(v - 1) // y` and `ny` is `(v - 1) % y`, it implies that `nx` equals `px` and `ny` equals `py`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 10^9, `px` is `(v - 1) // y`, `py` is `(v - 1) % y`, `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `v` is the third element in the list `a`, `nx` is `(v - 1) // y` which equals `px`, `ny` is `(v - 1) % y` which equals `py`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 10^9, `px` is `(v - 1) // y`, `py` is `(v - 1) % y`, `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `v` is the third element in the list `a`, `nx` equals `px` and is `(v - 1) // y`, `ny` equals `py` and is `(v - 1) % y`**
