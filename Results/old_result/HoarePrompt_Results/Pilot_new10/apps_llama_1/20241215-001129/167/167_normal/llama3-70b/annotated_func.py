#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are positive integers such that 1 ≤ x, y ≤ 10^9.
def func_1(x, y):
    px, py = 0, 0
    for v in a:
        nx, ny = (v - 1) // y, (v - 1) % y
        
        if abs(nx - px) + abs(ny - py) != 1:
            return False
        
        px, py = nx, ny
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 10^9, `px` is `(last element in a - 1) // y`, `py` is `(last element in a - 1) % y`, `a` is a list of consecutive elements in a specific pattern based on `x` and `y`, `nx` equals `px`, `ny` equals `py`, or if `a` is empty, `px`, `py`, `nx`, `ny` are 0.
    return True
    #The program returns a boolean value True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integer parameters x and y, but due to the undefined variable 'a', it will throw a NameError, indicating that 'a' is not defined, rather than performing any calculation or returning a boolean value based on x and y.
