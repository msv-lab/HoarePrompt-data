`px` and `py` are assigned the values of `nx` and `ny` respectively. Since `nx` equals `px` and is `(v - 1) // y`, and `ny` equals `py` and is `(v - 1) % y`, the values of `px` and `py` are not changed. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`x` and `y` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `x`, `y` ≤ 10^9, `px` is `(v - 1) // y`, `py` is `(v - 1) % y`, `a` is a list with at least 3 elements, `v` is the third element in the list `a`, `nx` equals `px` and is `(v - 1) // y`, `ny` equals `py` and is `(v - 1) % y`.**
