Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program appears to be a solution to the problem described, and it seems to handle all possible cases correctly. Here's an explanation of why I believe the program is correct:

1. **Handling cases where k > n**: The program correctly returns 'No' when k is greater than n, as it's impossible to find k integers such that the sum of 2 to the power of each number equals n.

2. **Bit manipulation**: The program uses bit manipulation to find the positions of the bits set in the binary representation of n. This is done using a loop that starts from the most significant bit (60) and goes down to the least significant bit (0).

3. **Checking if the number of bits is greater than k**: If the number of bits set in n is greater than k, the program returns 'No', as it's impossible to find k integers that satisfy the condition.

4. **Handling cases where the number of bits is less than k**: If the number of bits set in n is less than k, the program enters a loop that reduces the smallest bit set in n by 1 and adds two new bits with the reduced value. This process continues until the number of bits is equal to k.

5. **Sorting the bits in descending order**: Finally, the program sorts the bits in descending order and returns them as a string.

The program seems to handle all possible cases correctly, including edge cases like k > n, k == n, and k < n. It also correctly handles the case where n is 0.

I couldn't find any case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
