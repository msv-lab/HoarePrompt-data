The code introduces a new variable `i` and assigns it the value 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer equal to the first input integer, `k` is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is an empty list, and `i` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer equal to the first input integer, `k` is a positive integer equal to the second input integer, `n` is greater than or equal to `k`, `a` is an empty list, and `i` is 0**
