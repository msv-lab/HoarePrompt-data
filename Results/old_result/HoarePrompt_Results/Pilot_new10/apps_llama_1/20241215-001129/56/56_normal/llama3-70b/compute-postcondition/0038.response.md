The function `func` accepts no parameters, but it uses two external variables `n` and `k`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer. 

Please provide the output or return value of the function to complete the description of its functionality. 

Once the output or return value is provided, I can complete the description in the required format: Functionality: **functionality**.
