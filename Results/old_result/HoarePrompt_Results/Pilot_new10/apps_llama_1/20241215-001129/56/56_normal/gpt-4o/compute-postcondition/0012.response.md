The code appends the value of `i` to the list `bits`. The value of `i` is 58. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. `n` is still a non-negative integer, `k` is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and `k` is still less than or equal to `n`. 

Since `bits` was not mentioned in the initial state, we can assume it is a new list or its previous value is not relevant. After the execution, `bits` will contain the value 58.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is less than or equal to n, `i` is 58, `bits` is a list containing the value 58**
