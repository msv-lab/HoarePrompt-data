Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is less than or equal to n, `i` is 59. If the 60th bit of `n` is 1, `bits` is [60, 59]. If the 60th bit of `n` is 0, `bits` is [59] if the 59th bit of `n` is 1, otherwise `bits` is [60] if the initial `bits` was [60] or an empty list if the initial `bits` was empty.**
