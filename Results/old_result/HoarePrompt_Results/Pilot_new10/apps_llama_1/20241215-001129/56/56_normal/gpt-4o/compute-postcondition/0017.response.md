Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is less than or equal to n, `bits` is a list containing the indices of all bits in the original value of `n` that are 1, in descending order, `i` is -1, and the number of bits set in `n` (i.e., the length of `bits`) is less than or equal to `k`**
