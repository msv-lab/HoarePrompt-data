The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` through the standard input, attempts to construct a list of `k` integers representing the powers of 2 that sum up to `n`, and prints 'Yes' along with the list in descending order if successful, or 'No' otherwise. If `n` is less than `k`, it prints 'No'. The function assumes `n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer, but does not perform any input validation.
