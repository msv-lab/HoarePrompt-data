Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is increased by 1 from its previous state, `x` is equal to `n.bit_length() - 1`. If `x` is less than or equal to `i`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the state remains unchanged as there is no else part to handle this condition.***
