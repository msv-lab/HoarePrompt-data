The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `k` is a positive integer. The function returns a string that indicates whether a certain condition is met or not. If the condition is not met, the function returns 'No'. If the condition is met, the function returns 'Yes' followed by `k` elements of 'bits' that are sorted in descending order, where 'bits' contains original bits and additional bits set to 'smallest - 1'. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two parameters, a non-negative integer `n` and a positive integer `k`, and return a string indicating whether a certain condition is met, along with additional information if the condition is met.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a non-negative integer `n` and a positive integer `k`, and returns a string indicating whether a certain condition is met, along with additional information if the condition is met, specifically 'Yes' followed by `k` sorted 'bits' if the condition is met, and 'No' otherwise.**
