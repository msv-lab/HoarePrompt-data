Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and k is less than or equal to n, `bits` is an empty list, `i` is 60. The current value of the least significant bit of the 60th bit position of `n` (n >> i & 1) is 1, meaning the 60th bit of `n` is 1**
