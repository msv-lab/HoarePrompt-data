Postcondition: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^5 and 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, and `k` is less than or equal to `n`. The current value of `n` has a binary representation with more than `k` bits set to 1. `bits` is a list containing the indices of all bits in the original value of `n` that are 1, in descending order, and its length is greater than `k`. `i` is -1.**
