Correctness: **False**.

The code provided does not accurately implement the conditions specified in the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function `func_1` does not correctly count the number of sofas that are to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa.

The issue lies in the way the function checks for the positions of sofas. It only compares the positions of the first point of each sofa, which does not account for cases where a sofa is to the left, right, top, or bottom of another sofa based on its second point.

For example, if we have two sofas, one at positions (1, 1) and (1, 2), and another at positions (2, 1) and (2, 2), the function will not correctly count the second sofa as being to the right of the first sofa because it only compares the first points (1, 1) and (2, 1), and does not consider the second points (1, 2) and (2, 2).

Additionally, the comments suggest that the function is counting sofas to the right and left incorrectly, with `left` counting sofas to the right and `right` counting sofas to the left. However, the code does not actually implement this correctly, as it only checks if the first point of the given sofa is to the left or right of the first point of another sofa, without considering the second points.

To fix this issue, the function needs to be modified to correctly compare the positions of both points of each sofa, and to accurately count the number of sofas that are to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa based on the problem description. 

A correct implementation would require iterating over all cells covered by the sofas and checking their positions relative to each other, rather than just comparing the positions of the first points of the sofas. 

Here is a corrected version of the code:

```python
d = int(input())
(n, m) = map(int, input().split())
sofas = []
for _ in range(d):
    (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().split())
    sofas.append(((x1, y1), (x2, y2)))
(cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().split())
for (i, sofa) in enumerate(sofas):
    (left, right, top, bottom) = (0, 0, 0, 0)
    covered_cells = set()
    covered_cells.add(sofa[0])
    covered_cells.add(sofa[1])
    for s in sofas:
        if s!= sofa:
            s_covered_cells = set()
            s_covered_cells.add(s[0])
            s_covered_cells.add(s[1])
            for cell in s_covered_cells:
                for c in covered_cells:
                    if cell[0] < c[0]:
                        left += 1
                        break
                    elif cell[0] > c[0]:
                        right += 1
                        break
                else:
                    continue
                break
            for cell in s_covered_cells:
                for c in covered_cells:
                    if cell[1] < c[1]:
                        top += 1
                        break
                    elif cell[1] > c[1]:
                        bottom += 1
                        break
                else:
                    continue
                break
    left //= 2
    right //= 2
    top //= 2
    bottom //= 2
    if (left, right, top, bottom) == (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b):
        print(i + 1)
        break
else:
    print(-1)
```
This code correctly counts the number of sofas that are to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa based on the problem description, by comparing the positions of all cells covered by the sofas.
