Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least one sofa, `s` is the first sofa in `sofas`, `s` is not equal to `sofa`. If the first element of the first pair in `sofa` is equal to the first element of the first pair in `s` and the second element of the first pair in `sofa` is greater than the second element of the first pair in `s`, then the current values of `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged. If the first element of the first pair in `sofa` is equal to the first element of the first pair in `s` and the second element of the first pair in `sofa` is less than the second element of the first pair in `s`, then `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 1, and `bottom` is 1. Otherwise, `left`, `right`, `top`, and `bottom` remain unchanged, with `left` and `right` being determined by the conditions given in the precondition, and `top` being 0 if the conditions for `left` and `right` are not met, and `bottom` is the previous value of `bottom` plus 1 if the first element of the first pair in `sofa` is equal to the first element of the first pair in `s` and the second element of the first pair in `sofa` is less than the second element of the first pair in `s`.**
