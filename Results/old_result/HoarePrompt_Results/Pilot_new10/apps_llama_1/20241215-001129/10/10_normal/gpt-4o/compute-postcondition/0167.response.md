The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function uses several variables: the number of sofas `d`, the size of the storehouse `n` and `m`, the coordinates of each sofa `x_1`, `y_1`, `x_2`, `y_2`, and the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa `cnt_{l}`, `cnt_{r}`, `cnt_{t}`, `cnt_{b}`. 

However, since the function does not explicitly accept these as parameters, it is assumed that these values are provided through a different means, such as standard input.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to process the input related to the number of sofas, storehouse size, sofa coordinates, and sofa positions relative to Grandpa Maks's sofa.

Functionality: **The function processes input related to the number of sofas, storehouse size, sofa coordinates, and sofa positions relative to Grandpa Maks's sofa, but does not accept these as parameters and does not have a specified return value.**
