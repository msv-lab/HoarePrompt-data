The given code is `d = int(input().strip())`. 

This line of code reads an integer from the input and assigns it to the variable `d`. 

Given the initial state, the first line of the input contains an integer `d` (1 ≤ `d` ≤ 10^5) representing the number of sofas.

So, the variable `d` is assigned the value of the number of sofas.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

The output state is: `d` is the number of sofas, the next lines of the input contain the size of the storehouse, the coordinates of each sofa, and the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa, respectively, are still to be read.

Output State: **`d` is the number of sofas, the input for the size of the storehouse, the coordinates of each sofa, and the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of Grandpa Maks's sofa are pending**
