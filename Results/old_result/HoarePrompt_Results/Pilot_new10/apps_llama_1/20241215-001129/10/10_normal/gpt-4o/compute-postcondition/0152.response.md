To ensure the loop can execute, we must consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop statement is `for i in range(d):`, which means it will iterate `d` times, with `i` taking values from 0 to `d-1`. 

Given that `d` is a non-negative integer, if `d` is 0, the loop will not execute at all because `range(0)` is an empty sequence. For the loop to execute at least once, `d` must be greater than 0.

At the start of the loop, `i` is not defined in the given state, but as the loop begins, `i` will take the value of 0 (since `range(d)` starts from 0). 

The other variables (`n`, `m`, `sofas`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, `bottom_count`, `target_sofa`) do not affect the loop's ability to start executing but are relevant for the loop body's logic.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute must include that `d` is greater than 0, and `i` starts at 0.

State: **`d` is greater than 0, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas to the left of the sofa at index `i`, `right_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas to the right of the sofa at index `i`, `top_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas below the sofa at index `i`, `bottom_count` is a list of length `d` where each value at index `i` represents the number of sofas above the sofa at index `i`, `target_sofa` is -1, `i` is 0**
