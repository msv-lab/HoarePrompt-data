Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way it calculates the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. 

The function `func_1` only checks if the x or y coordinates of the first point of the sofa and the first point of another sofa are equal, which does not satisfy the condition of being to the left, right, top, or bottom of each other as described in the problem.

For example, in the input:
```
2
3 2
3 1 3 2
1 2 2 2
1 0 0 1
```
The function `func_1` will only count the number of sofas that share the same x or y coordinate with the first point of the sofa, which is not equivalent to the problem description.

Moreover, the counters `left` and `right` in the function `func_1` seem to be swapped, as `left` counts sofas to the right and `right` counts sofas to the left. This discrepancy will lead to incorrect results.

Additionally, the function `func_1` only checks the first point of each sofa, which is not sufficient. It should check all points of each sofa to correctly determine the relative positions.

The correct implementation should check all points of each sofa and count the number of sofas that satisfy the conditions of being to the left, right, top, or bottom of each other, as described in the problem. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and the Correctness is **False**.
