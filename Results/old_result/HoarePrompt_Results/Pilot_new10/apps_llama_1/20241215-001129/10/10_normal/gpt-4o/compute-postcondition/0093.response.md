According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d` and the loop counter `j`. If `j` is less than `d`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is at least 2, `j` is 1. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be increased by 1, so `j` is 2. Also, for the loop to execute again, `d` must be at least 3, because `j` is now 2 and it must be less than `d` to execute the loop body again.

State: **`d` is at least 3, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 2, `x1_j = sofas[2][0]`, `y1_j = sofas[2][1]`, `x2_j = sofas[2][2]`, `y2_j = sofas[2][3]`**
