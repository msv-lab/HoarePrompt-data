To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute, let's analyze the given loop statement: `for j in range(d):`. This loop will execute as long as `d` is greater than 0, because the range function in Python generates a sequence of numbers starting from 0 up to but not including the value specified in the range function. 

Given the initial state: 
- `d` is a positive integer,
- `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse,
- `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse,
- `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates,
- `cnt_l` is an input integer,
- `cnt_r` is an input integer,
- `cnt_t` is an input integer,
- `cnt_b` is an input integer,
- `left_count` is a list containing `d` zeros,
- `right_count` is a list containing `d` zeros,
- `top_count` is a list containing `d` zeros,
- `bottom_count` is a list containing `d` zeros,
- `i` is 0,
- `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the first sofa in `sofas`.

The loop variable `j` is introduced in the for loop statement, which will start from 0 and go up to `d-1`. Since `d` is already stated to be a positive integer, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once.

For the loop to execute, we do not need to adjust `n`, `m`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, `i`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` as their values do not affect the loop's execution. However, `sofas` must contain at least one sofa (which is guaranteed since `d` is positive and `sofas` contains `d` tuples), and the lists `left_count`, `right_count`, `top_count`, `bottom_count` must have at least one element each (which is also guaranteed since they contain `d` zeros).

State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `left_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `right_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `top_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `bottom_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the first sofa in `sofas`, `j` is 0**
