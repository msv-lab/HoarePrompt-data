The given Python code updates the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` based on the elements of `sofas[j]`. 

`x1_j` is assigned the value of the first element of `sofas[j]`, 
`y1_j` is assigned the value of the second element of `sofas[j]`, 
`x2_j` is assigned the value of the third element of `sofas[j]`, 
`y2_j` is assigned the value of the fourth element of `sofas[j]`.

Other variables are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`d` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, 
`j` is 2, 
`n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, 
`m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, 
`sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates, 
`cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, 
`x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`, 
`y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`, 
`x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`, 
`y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`, 
`x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`, 
`y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`, 
`x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`, 
`y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`.
