The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code in the current iteration of the loop and moves on to the next iteration. 

The values of the variables do not change but we move on to the next iteration of the most internal loop. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`d` is a positive integer, 
`n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, 
`m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, 
`sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, 
`cnt_l` is an input integer, 
`cnt_r` is an input integer, 
`cnt_t` is an input integer, 
`cnt_b` is an input integer, 
`i` and `j` are integers where `j` is incremented by 1, 
`x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the first sofa in `sofas`, 
`x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the `j-th` sofa in `sofas` where `j` is incremented by 1, 
if `x1` is less than `x1_j` and `x2` is less than `x1_j`, then `right_count` is a list containing `d` values where the value at index `j` (after increment) is 1 and the rest are zeros, 
otherwise `right_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, 
`left_count` is a list containing `d` values where the value at index `j` (after increment) is 1 and the rest are zeros if `x1` is greater than `x2_j` and `x2` is greater than `x2_j`, 
otherwise `left_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, 
if `y1` is greater than `y2_j` and `y2` is greater than `y2_j`, then `top_count` is a list containing `d` values where the value at index `j` (after increment) is 1 and the rest are zeros, 
otherwise `top_count` and `bottom_count` remain as lists containing `d` zeros, 
`bottom_count` is a list containing `d` values where the value at index `j` (after increment) is 1 and the rest are zeros if `y1` is less than `y1_j` and `y2` is less than `y1_j`, 
otherwise `bottom_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, and we move on to the next iteration of the most internal loop.
