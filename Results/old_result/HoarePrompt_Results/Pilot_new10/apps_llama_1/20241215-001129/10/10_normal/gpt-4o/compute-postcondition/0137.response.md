To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop condition, which is `j` ranging from 0 to `d-1`. Given that at the end of the previous iteration, `j` is 1, for the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since `d` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, and `j` is currently 1, for the loop to continue, `j` should be less than `d`. Therefore, after incrementing `j` by 1, `j` becomes 2. 

All other variables (`n`, `m`, `sofas`, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j`) do not directly depend on the loop variable `j` for their values to change in a way that affects the loop's continuation. However, since `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are defined based on `sofas[j]`, their values will change as `j` increments because they are derived from the `j-th` element of `sofas`.

Since `d` is greater than 1 and `j` needs to be less than `d` for the loop to continue, and given that `j` is currently 1, after incrementing, `j` will be 2. The list `sofas` must contain at least `d+2` tuples, so when `j` is 2, `sofas` still has enough elements for `sofas[j]` to be valid.

State: **`d` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `j` is 2, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`, `y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`, `x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`, `y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`, `x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`.**
