To calculate the output state, we must analyze the provided code and the initial state. 

The initial state specifies that `d` is at least 2, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 1, `left_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa, `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the left of each sofa, `top_count` and `bottom_count` are lists containing at least `d+1` values, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the second sofa in `sofas`, i.e., `x1_j = sofas[1][0]`, `y1_j = sofas[1][1]`, `x2_j = sofas[1][2]`, `y2_j = sofas[1][3]`.

The code provided is `right_count[i] += 1`. However, we need to note that `i` is not defined in the given initial state, but based on the context, it seems `i` should be `j` since `j` is defined as 1. Assuming `i` is actually `j` (which is 1), the code increments the value of `right_count` at index `j` (which is the second element in `right_count` since indexing starts at 0) by 1.

Given this correction and understanding, the output state would be:

- `d` is at least 2
- `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse
- `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse
- `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates
- `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers
- `j` is 1
- `left_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa
- `right_count` is a list where the second element (`right_count[1]`) has been incremented by 1, thus `right_count[1] = right_count[1] + 1`
- `top_count` and `bottom_count` are lists containing at least `d+1` values
- `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the second sofa in `sofas`

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `j` is 1, `left_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values, `right_count` is a list where the second element is `right_count[1] + 1`, `top_count` and `bottom_count` are lists containing at least `d+1` values, `x1_j = sofas[1][0]`, `y1_j = sofas[1][1]`, `x2_j = sofas[1][2]`, `y2_j = sofas[1][3]`.**
