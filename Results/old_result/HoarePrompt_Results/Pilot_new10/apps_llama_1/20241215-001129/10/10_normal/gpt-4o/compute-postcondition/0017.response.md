To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state. 

The initial state includes:
- `d` is a non-negative integer.
- `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse.
- `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse.
- `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates.
- `cnt_l` is an input integer.
- `cnt_r` is an input integer.
- `cnt_t` is an input integer.
- `cnt_b` is an input integer.
- `left_count` is a list containing `d` zeros.
- `right_count` is a list containing `d` zeros.
- `top_count` is a list containing `d` zeros.

The code snippet is:
```python
bottom_count = [0] * d
```

This code creates a new list called `bottom_count` and initializes it with `d` zeros. 

The impact of this code on the program is the creation of a new list `bottom_count` with `d` elements, all of which are zeros. The previous values of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `d` is a non-negative integer.
- `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse.
- `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse.
- `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates.
- `cnt_l` is an input integer.
- `cnt_r` is an input integer.
- `cnt_t` is an input integer.
- `cnt_b` is an input integer.
- `left_count` is a list containing `d` zeros.
- `right_count` is a list containing `d` zeros.
- `top_count` is a list containing `d` zeros.
- `bottom_count` is a list containing `d` zeros.

Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `left_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `right_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `top_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `bottom_count` is a list containing `d` zeros**
