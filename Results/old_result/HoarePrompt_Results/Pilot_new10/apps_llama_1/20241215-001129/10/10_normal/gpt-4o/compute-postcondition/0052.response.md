The code `x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j = sofas[j]` updates the values of `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` to be the coordinates of the `(j+1)-th` sofa in the `sofas` list. 

Since `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates and `j` is an integer, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, and `y2_j` are now set to the `(j+1)-th` sofa coordinates in `sofas`.

The states of other variables remain unchanged. 

The precondition that `d` is a positive integer greater than the current `j`, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `i` and `j` are integers, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the first sofa in `sofas`, and the conditional check for `i` and `j` are still valid.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than the current `j`, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `i` and `j` are integers where `j` is incremented by 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the first sofa in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the `(j+1)-th` sofa in `sofas`, and if `i` is equal to `j`, we move to the next iteration of the most internal loop, otherwise the program continues with the current state**.
