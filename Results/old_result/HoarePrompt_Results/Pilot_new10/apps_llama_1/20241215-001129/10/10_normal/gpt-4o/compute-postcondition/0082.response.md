The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there's no loop shown in the provided snippet, the impact of `continue` cannot be directly assessed. However, based on the given initial state and the nature of the `continue` statement, we can infer its general effect.

Given that `continue` does not modify variables or terminate the program, and assuming it is part of a loop (not shown in the snippet), the variables' states remain unchanged. The loop will simply move on to the next iteration, skipping any code that follows the `continue` statement within the loop.

Output State: **`d` is at least 2, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+1` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the second sofa in `sofas`, `j` is 1, `left_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa, `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+1` values representing the number of sofas to the left of each sofa, `top_count` and `bottom_count` are lists containing at least `d+1` values, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
