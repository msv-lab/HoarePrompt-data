The code `continue` skips the rest of the current iteration and moves to the next iteration of the loop. Since `j` is incremented by 1, the next iteration will use the updated value of `j`. 

The values of the variables do not change but we move to the next iteration of the most internal loop. 

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer greater than the current `j`, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `i` and `j` are integers where `j` is incremented by 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the first sofa in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the `(j+1)-th` sofa in `sofas` and we move to the next iteration of the most internal loop.**
