To calculate the result, we need to understand the impact of the code on the program. The given code snippet is:

```python
x1, y1, x2, y2 = sofas[i]
```

This line of code unpacks the tuple at index `i` of the `sofas` list into four variables: `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`.

Given the initial state:
- `d` is a positive integer
- `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse
- `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse
- `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates
- `cnt_l` is an input integer
- `cnt_r` is an input integer
- `cnt_t` is an input integer
- `cnt_b` is an input integer
- `left_count` is a list containing `d` zeros
- `right_count` is a list containing `d` zeros
- `top_count` is a list containing `d` zeros
- `bottom_count` is a list containing `d` zeros
- `i` is 0

The values of `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are determined by the tuple at index `i` (which is 0) in the `sofas` list. Therefore, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2` are assigned the values of the first sofa's coordinates.

Output State: **`d` is a positive integer, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `left_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `right_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `top_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `bottom_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `i` is 0, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the first sofa in `sofas`**
