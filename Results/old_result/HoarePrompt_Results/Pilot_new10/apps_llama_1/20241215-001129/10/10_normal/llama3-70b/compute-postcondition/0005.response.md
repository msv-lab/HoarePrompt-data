Postcondition: ***`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least one sofa, `s` is the first sofa in `sofas`, `s` is not equal to `sofa`. If the first element of the first pair in `sofa` is less than the first element of the first pair in `s` and the second element of the first pair in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first pair in `s`, then `left` is 1, `right` is 0, `top` is 0, `bottom` is 0. Otherwise, `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` remain 0.***
