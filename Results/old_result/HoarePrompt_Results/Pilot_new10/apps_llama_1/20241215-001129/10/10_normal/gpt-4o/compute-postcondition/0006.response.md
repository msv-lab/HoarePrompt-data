According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `d`. If `d` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `d` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `d` must be greater than 1 because the loop counter is decreased by 1 at the end of each iteration (as it is a range-based loop).

State: **`d` is greater than 1, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing one tuple of sofa coordinates `[(x1, y1, x2, y2)]`, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers**
