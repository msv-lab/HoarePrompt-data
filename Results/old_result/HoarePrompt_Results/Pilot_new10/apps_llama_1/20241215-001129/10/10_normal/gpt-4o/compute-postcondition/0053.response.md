The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a positive integer greater than the current `j`, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `i` and `j` are integers where `j` is incremented by 1, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are the coordinates of the first sofa in `sofas`, `x1_j`, `y1_j`, `x2_j`, `y2_j` are the coordinates of the `(j+1)-th` sofa in `sofas`, `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, and if `i` is equal to `j`, we move to the next iteration of the most internal loop, otherwise the program continues with the current state.
