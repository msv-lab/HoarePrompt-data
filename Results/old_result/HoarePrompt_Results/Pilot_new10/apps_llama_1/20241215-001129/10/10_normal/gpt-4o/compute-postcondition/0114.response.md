The value of `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `d` is a non-negative integer, `j` is 0, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing at least `d+2` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l`, `cnt_r`, `cnt_t`, `cnt_b` are input integers, `left_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas to the left of each sofa, `right_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas to the right of each sofa where `right_count[i]` is incremented by 1, `top_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas below each sofa, `bottom_count` is a list containing at least `d+2` values representing the number of sofas above each sofa, `x1` equals the first element of `sofas[i]`, `y1` equals the second element of `sofas[i]`, `x2` equals the third element of `sofas[i]`, `y2` equals the fourth element of `sofas[i]`, `x1_j` equals the first element of `sofas[j]`, `y1_j` equals the second element of `sofas[j]`, `x2_j` equals the third element of `sofas[j]`, `y2_j` equals the fourth element of `sofas[j]`. The current value of `x1` is less than the current value of `x1_j` and the current value of `x2` is less than the current value of `x1_j`.
