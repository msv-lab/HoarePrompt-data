The code takes an input and splits it into four integers, which are then assigned to the variables `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, and `y2`. The input is expected to contain four space-separated integers.

The states of `d`, `n`, `m`, and `sofas` are not affected by this code. The value of `d` is still greater than 0, `n` is still the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is still the number of columns of the storehouse, and `sofas` is still an empty list.

Output State: **`d` is greater than 0, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, the coordinates of each sofa are pending but the relative positions are now partly defined by `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` which are input integers, `sofas` is an empty list, `x1`, `y1`, `x2`, `y2` are input integers**
