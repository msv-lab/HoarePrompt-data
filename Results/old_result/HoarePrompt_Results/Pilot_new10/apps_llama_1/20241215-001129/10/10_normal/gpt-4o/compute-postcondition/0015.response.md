The given code creates a new list `right_count` containing `d` zeros. This operation does not affect the values of the existing variables. Therefore, all variables maintain their previous values, and a new variable `right_count` is added to the state.

Output State: **`d` is a non-negative integer, `n` is the number of rows of the storehouse, `m` is the number of columns of the storehouse, `sofas` is a list containing `d` tuples of sofa coordinates, `cnt_l` is an input integer, `cnt_r` is an input integer, `cnt_t` is an input integer, `cnt_b` is an input integer, `left_count` is a list containing `d` zeros, `right_count` is a list containing `d` zeros**
