Postcondition: **`sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists that must have at least one sofa, `s` is the first sofa in `sofas`, `s` is not equal to `sofa`. The first element of the first pair in `sofa` is greater than the first element of the first pair in `s` and the second element of the first pair in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first pair in `s`. `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` are integers where initially they were 0, and the current values of `left`, `right`, `top`, `bottom` depend on the conditions given in the precondition, but the condition that sets `left` to 1 and `right`, `top`, `bottom` to 0 is not met because the condition for that was the opposite of the condition in the if statement.**
