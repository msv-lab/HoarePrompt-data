The value of `right` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `right` is unknown, so the output state is: `sofa` is a list of four integers, `sofas` is a list of lists with at least two sofas, `s` is the second sofa in `sofas`. If the first element of the first tuple in `sofa` is less than the first element of the first tuple in `s` and the second element of the first tuple in `sofa` is equal to the second element of the first tuple in `s`, then `left` is increased by 1, and `right` is increased by 1.
