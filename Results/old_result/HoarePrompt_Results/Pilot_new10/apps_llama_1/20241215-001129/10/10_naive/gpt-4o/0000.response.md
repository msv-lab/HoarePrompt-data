Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa. 

The current implementation only checks if the x-coordinates of the current sofa are less than the x-coordinates of the other sofa for the "left" condition, which is incorrect. It should also consider the cases where the current sofa's x-coordinates are equal to the other sofa's x-coordinates and the current sofa's y-coordinates are less than the other sofa's y-coordinates. 

A similar issue exists for the "right", "top", and "bottom" conditions.

For example, consider the input:

```
2
3 2
3 1 3 2
1 2 2 2
1 0 0 1
```

The program will incorrectly calculate the number of sofas to the left and right of the first sofa. 

To fix this, the program should be modified to correctly calculate the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of each sofa, considering all possible cases. 

Here is an example of how the corrected code could look like:

```python
def func():
    d = int(input().strip())
    (n, m) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    sofas = []
    for _ in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = map(int, input().strip().split())
        sofas.append((x1, y1, x2, y2))
    (cnt_l, cnt_r, cnt_t, cnt_b) = map(int, input().strip().split())
    left_count = [0] * d
    right_count = [0] * d
    top_count = [0] * d
    bottom_count = [0] * d
    for i in range(d):
        (x1, y1, x2, y2) = sofas[i]
        x = min(x1, x2)
        y = min(y1, y2)
        for j in range(d):
            if i == j:
                continue
            (x1_j, y1_j, x2_j, y2_j) = sofas[j]
            x_j = min(x1_j, x2_j)
            y_j = min(y1_j, y2_j)
            if x < x_j:
                right_count[i] += 1
            elif x > x_j:
                left_count[i] += 1
            if y < y_j:
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            elif y > y_j:
                top_count[i] += 1
            # Check for same x and different y
            if x == x_j and y < y_j:
                right_count[i] += 1
            elif x == x_j and y > y_j:
                left_count[i] += 1
            # Check for same y and different x
            if y == y_j and x < x_j:
                bottom_count[i] += 1
            elif y == y_j and x > x_j:
                top_count[i] += 1
    target_sofa = -1
    for i in range(d):
        if left_count[i] == cnt_l and right_count[i] == cnt_r and (top_count[i] == cnt_t) and (bottom_count[i] == cnt_b):
            target_sofa = i + 1
            break
    print(target_sofa)
```
This corrected code should now work correctly for all cases.
