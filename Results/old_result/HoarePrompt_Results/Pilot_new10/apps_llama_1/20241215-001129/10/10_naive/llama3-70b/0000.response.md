Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly calculate the number of sofas to the left, right, top, and bottom of a given sofa. 

In the provided `func_1` function, the program only checks if the first point of the sofa is in the same column or row as the first point of another sofa, and if it is to the left, right, top, or bottom of that sofa. This is not sufficient to correctly determine the positions of the sofas relative to each other.

For example, consider the case where the storehouse has two sofas, one at positions (1, 1) and (1, 2), and another at positions (2, 1) and (2, 2). According to the problem description, the first sofa is to the left of the second sofa because point (1, 1) is to the left of point (2, 1). However, the provided `func_1` function would not correctly count the second sofa as being to the right of the first sofa because it only checks the first point of each sofa.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to check all points of each sofa and compare them with all points of the other sofas. 

Here's a simple example to show how the provided code can be incorrect:

Input:
```
2
3 3
1 1 1 2
2 2 2 3
1 0 0 1
```

Expected output:
```
1
```

Actual output might not be the expected output because the provided code does not correctly calculate the positions of the sofas relative to each other.

Therefore, the provided program does not correctly solve the given problem for all possible inputs, and its correctness is **False**.
