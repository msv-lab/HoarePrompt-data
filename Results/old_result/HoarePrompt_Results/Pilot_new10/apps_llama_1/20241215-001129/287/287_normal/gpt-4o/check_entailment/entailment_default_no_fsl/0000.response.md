Correctness: **False**

The given code does not accurately solve the problem as described. It appears to count the number of factors of the input number `n`, not the number of different weights of its splits. 

To solve the problem as described, we need to generate all possible splits of `n` and count the number of elements that are equal to the first element in each split. This code does not do that. 

For example, for the input 7, the code will output the total number of factors of 7 (which is 2: 1 and 7), but the correct output is 4, because there are 4 possible weights of splits of 7: Weight 1: [7], Weight 2: [3, 3, 1], Weight 3: [2, 2, 2, 1], Weight 7: [1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1, 1]. 

Therefore, the code does not work correctly for every potential case.
