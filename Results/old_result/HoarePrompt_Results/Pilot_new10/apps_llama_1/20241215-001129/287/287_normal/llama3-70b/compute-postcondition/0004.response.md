The code increments the value of `res` by 2. The initial value of `res` is 0, so the new value of `res` will be 0 + 2 = 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still an input integer that must be at least 1, `i` is still 1, and `n` is still a multiple of `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `res` is 2, `i` is 1, and `n` is a multiple of `i`.**
