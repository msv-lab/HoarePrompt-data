To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the condition of the `while` loop: `i * i <= num`. 

For the loop to execute again, the condition `i * i <= num` must still be true after the previous iteration. 

Given that `i` is 3 at the end of the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `3 * 3 <= num` is still true for the next iteration, but since `i` will increase in the loop body (not shown), we actually need to consider the next value of `i`, which is 4, to make sure the loop can execute again. Thus, we need `4 * 4 <= num` to be true for the loop to execute one more time.

Given `num` is at least 9, for the loop to execute again with `i` increasing to 4, `num` needs to be adjusted so that it is at least 16 (because `4 * 4 = 16`), to ensure that the loop condition `i * i <= num` holds true for `i = 4`.

The states of `count` depend on whether `i` is a factor of `num`, but this does not affect the loop condition directly. Thus, the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time pertain to ensuring that `i * i <= num` is true for the next iteration of `i`.

State: **`num` must be at least 16, `i` is 3, if `i` is a factor of `num`, then `count` is 2, if `i` is not a factor of `num`, then `count` is 4**
