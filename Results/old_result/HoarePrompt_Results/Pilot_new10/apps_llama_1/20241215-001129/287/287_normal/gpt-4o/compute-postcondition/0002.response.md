According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition `i * i <= num`. For the loop to execute at least one time, this condition must be true. Given that `i` is 1, `i * i` equals 1. Since `num` is a positive integer, the condition `1 <= num` is already met, ensuring that `i * i <= num` is also true for the first iteration because 1 (which is `i * i`) is less than or equal to any positive integer `num`. 

Therefore, no adjustments to the state are necessary for the loop to execute one more time because the condition is already satisfied with the given initial values of `i` and the range of `num`.

State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= num <= 10^9, `count` is 0, `i` is 1**
