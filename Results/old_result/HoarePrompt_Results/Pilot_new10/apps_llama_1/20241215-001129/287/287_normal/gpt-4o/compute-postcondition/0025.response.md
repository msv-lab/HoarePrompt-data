The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer parameter `num` and returns the total number of factors of `num`. 

To calculate the total number of factors, it iterates through all integers from 1 to the square root of `num`, checking for divisibility. If `num` is divisible by an integer `i`, it increments the count of factors. Additionally, if `i` is not equal to `num // i` (i.e., `i` is not the square root of `num`), it increments the count again to account for the corresponding factor `num // i`. This approach ensures that all factors are counted, including both the square root (if `num` is a perfect square) and any other pairs of factors.

Looking at the code line by line, it appears to accurately implement the described functionality without any obvious missing logic or edge cases that are not handled. The function should work correctly for all positive integers `num` within the specified range (1 <= num <= 10^9), including perfect squares and numbers with an odd or even number of factors.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `num` and returns the total number of factors of `num` by iterating through integers up to its square root, counting both each factor and its corresponding pair (if different), thus covering all cases including perfect squares and numbers with an odd or even number of factors. **
