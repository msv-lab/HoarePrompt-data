Given the initial state, `n` is an integer that is at least 10, `i` is 3, and `res` depends on the value of `n`. Since `n` is at least 10, it cannot be 9. Therefore, `res` can either be 2 if `n` is divisible by 3, or -1 if `n` is not divisible by 3.

The code `res += 2` increments the value of `res` by 2.

- If `n` is divisible by 3, then `res` was 2, and after the increment, `res` becomes 4.
- If `n` is not divisible by 3, then `res` was -1, and after the increment, `res` becomes 1.

The value of `i` remains unchanged as 3.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer that is at least 10, `i` is 3, and `res` is either 4 if `n` is divisible by 3, or 1 if `n` is not divisible by 3.
Output State: **`n` is an integer that is at least 10, `i` is 3, and `res` is either 4 if `n` is divisible by 3, or 1 if `n` is not divisible by 3**
