Postcondition: ***`num` is at least 9, `i` is 2. If `i` is not a factor of `num`, then `count` is 4. Since there is no else part, no additional conditions are applied when `i` is a factor of `num`, so in such cases, the values of `num`, `i`, and `count` remain as they were before the if statement, meaning `count` remains 3 if `i` is a factor of `num`.***
