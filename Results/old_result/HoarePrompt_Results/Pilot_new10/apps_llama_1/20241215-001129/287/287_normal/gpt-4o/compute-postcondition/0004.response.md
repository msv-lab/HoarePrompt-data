The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so the new value of `count` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `count` is 1, `i` is 1, and the current value of `num` is divisible by `i`, meaning `num` is a multiple of 1.
Output State: **`num` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `num` <= 10^9, `count` is 1, `i` is 1**
