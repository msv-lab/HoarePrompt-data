According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 2. The loop will execute again if `i` (which is now 2) is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. This means `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 (since 2 squared is 4) for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is an integer that is at least 4, `i` is 2, `res` is 0**
