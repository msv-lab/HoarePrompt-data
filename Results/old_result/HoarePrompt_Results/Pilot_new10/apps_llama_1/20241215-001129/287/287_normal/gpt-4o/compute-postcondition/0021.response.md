The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `i` is 3, so the new value of `i` is 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. However, since `i` has changed, we need to re-evaluate the condition for `count`. 
If `num` is divisible by the new value of `i` (i.e., 4), then `count` is 4. If `num` is not divisible by the new value of `i`, then `count` is 6. 
Also, `num` is at least 16.

Output State: **`num` is at least 16, `i` is 4. If `num` is divisible by 4, then `count` is 4. If `num` is not divisible by 4, then `count` is 6.**
