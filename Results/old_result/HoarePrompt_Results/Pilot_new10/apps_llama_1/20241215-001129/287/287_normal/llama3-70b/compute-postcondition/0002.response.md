According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over a range from 1 to the square root of `n` (inclusive). For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1, because the square root of a non-positive number would not produce a valid range for the loop. Additionally, `i` is introduced in the loop and takes the value of the current iteration, starting from 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer that must be at least 1, `res` is 0, `i` is 1**
