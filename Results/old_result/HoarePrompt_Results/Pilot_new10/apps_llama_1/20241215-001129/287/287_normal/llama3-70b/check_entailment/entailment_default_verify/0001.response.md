The original assessment claimed that the given program does not correctly calculate the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`. However, based on the output hints provided, it seems that the program is actually calculating the total number of divisors of `n`.

Upon re-examining the problem description, we can see that the number of different weights of splits of `n` is indeed related to the number of divisors of `n`. For each divisor `i` of `n`, we can construct a split of `n` with weight `i` (e.g., `[i, i,..., i, x]` where `x` is the remaining sum). Conversely, for each split of `n` with weight `i`, `i` must be a divisor of `n`.

Therefore, the number of different weights of splits of `n` is equal to the number of divisors of `n`. The provided code correctly calculates this count, taking into account the case where `n` is a perfect square.

The original assessment was incorrect because it did not recognize the relationship between the number of different weights of splits and the number of divisors.

Final: **True**
