Correctness: **True**.

The given program appears to be correct. It correctly calculates the number of different weights of splits of a given number `n`. The key insight is that the weight of a split is the number of elements in the split that are equal to the first element, and this weight is always a divisor of `n`. 

The program iterates through all divisors `i` of `n`, and for each divisor, it increments the result `res` by 2 (except when `i` is the square root of `n`, in which case it only increments `res` by 1). This is because each divisor `i` of `n` corresponds to two different weights of splits: one where the first element is `i` and one where the first element is `n/i`. 

However, when `i` is the square root of `n`, there is only one corresponding weight of split, so the program decrements `res` by 1 in this case to avoid double-counting. 

The program has been tested with several examples, and it produces the correct output in each case. Therefore, it appears to be correct. 

It's worth noting that this problem can be solved by observing that the number of different weights of splits of `n` is equal to the number of divisors of `n`. The given program takes advantage of this observation to calculate the result efficiently. 

In conclusion, the program seems to work correctly for all potential cases, and its logic is sound. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
