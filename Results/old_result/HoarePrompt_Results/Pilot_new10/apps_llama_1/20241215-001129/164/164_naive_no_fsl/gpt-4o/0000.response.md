Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the grasshopper can reach the target insect. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the target insect is reachable by jumping from the grasshopper's position to the target insect's position in steps of `k`, but it does not consider the case where the grasshopper can jump to a position that is not in the direct path from the grasshopper's position to the target insect's position.

A counterexample to the program is the input:

```
8 3
G...#...T
```

In this case, the program will output 'NO' because it cannot reach the target insect by jumping in steps of 3 from the grasshopper's position. However, the correct output should be 'YES' because the grasshopper can jump to the position 3 steps to the right, then jump to the position 3 steps to the right again, and finally jump to the target insect's position.

To correctly solve this problem, a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm should be used to explore all possible positions that the grasshopper can reach by jumping in steps of `k`.

Here's a correct implementation in Python:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    queue = deque([G_pos])
    visited = {G_pos}
    
    while queue:
        pos = queue.popleft()
        if pos == T_pos:
            print('YES')
            return
        for new_pos in [pos - k, pos + k]:
            if 0 <= new_pos < n and new_pos not in visited and line[new_pos]!= '#':
                queue.append(new_pos)
                visited.add(new_pos)
    print('NO')

func()
```

This implementation uses a BFS algorithm to explore all possible positions that the grasshopper can reach by jumping in steps of `k`, and it correctly determines whether the target insect is reachable.
