The code sets the value of `reachable` to `True`. The previous values of `n`, `k`, `line`, `G_pos`, and `T_pos` are not affected by this assignment. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'T` otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T` if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T`, or the original index of 'G` otherwise, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, and `reachable` is `True**.
