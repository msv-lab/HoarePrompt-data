The value of `t` is updated to be equal to `i`, which is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. The character at index `i` of string `s` is 'T' and `i` is 0, so the character at index 0 of string `s` is 'T'. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' appears exactly once and 'T' appears exactly once at index 0, the current value of `g` is -1, `t` is 0, `i` is 0**
