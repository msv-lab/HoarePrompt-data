## Step 1: Identify the input variables
The input variables are n and k, where n is the number of cells in the line and k is the length of one grasshopper's jump. Additionally, there is a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T'.


## Step 2: Determine the relationship between the input variables
The relationship between n and k is that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1. The string of length n provides information about the state of each cell in the line.


## Step 3: Extract the precondition
The precondition is a description of the values of the program's input variables and the relationship between these variables. In this case, the precondition includes the constraints on the values of n and k, and the format of the string.


The final answer is: 
Precondition: **n is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), k is an integer between 1 and n-1 (inclusive), and the input string is of length n and consists of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once.**
