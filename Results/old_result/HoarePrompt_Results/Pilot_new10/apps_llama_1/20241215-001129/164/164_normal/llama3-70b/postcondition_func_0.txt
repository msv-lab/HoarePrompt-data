The function reads two lines of input, the first line containing two positive integers `n` and `k`, and the second line a string of length `n` with specific characters, and it prints 'YES' if the absolute difference between the indices of 'G' and 'T' is a multiple of `k` and the substring of `s` from `g` to `t` (or `t` to `g`), stepping by `k`, contains no '#' characters; otherwise, it prints 'NO', assuming the input is well-formed and 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string.
