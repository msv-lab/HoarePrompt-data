The function `func` accepts parameters through standard input: two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is the length of the input string and `k` is the step size, and a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once. The function then determines if there is a path from the position of 'G' to the position of 'T' in the string with a step size of `k` without encountering '#'. 

If 'G' is to the right of 'T' in the string, the function swaps their positions. It then checks each position from the position of 'G' to the position of 'T' with a step size of `k`. If it encounters a '#', it stops checking and prints 'NO'. If it successfully checks all positions without encountering a '#', it prints 'YES'. 

The function does not handle cases where the input string does not contain exactly one 'G' and one 'T', or where the length of the string is not equal to `n`, or where `k` is not an integer between 1 and `n-1`. 

The function does not return any value; it prints either 'YES' or 'NO' to the output.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` and a string of length `n` with specific character constraints through standard input, and prints 'YES' if there is a path from 'G' to 'T' with a step size of `k` without encountering '#', and 'NO' otherwise, assuming 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string and `k` is a valid step size. **
