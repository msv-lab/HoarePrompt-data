The code `T_pos = line.index('T')` assigns the index of 'T' in `line` to `T_pos`. Since 'T' appears exactly once in `line`, this index is well-defined and unique. 

The previous values of the variables are: 
- `n` is an input integer
- `k` is an input integer
- `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once
- `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`

After the code is executed, the new variable `T_pos` is introduced, which is the index of 'T' in `line`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the index of 'G' in `line`, `T_pos` is the index of 'T' in `line`**
