Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `g` is the index of 'G' in `s`, `t` is the index of 'T' in `s`, and both `g` and `t` are not equal to -1. If the absolute difference between `t` and `g` is a multiple of `k` and the substring of `s` from `g` to `t` (or `t` to `g`), stepping by `k`, contains no '#' characters, then 'YES' has been printed. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed.**
