Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the way the program checks for the path from 'G' to 'T'. 

In the problem description, it is stated that the grasshopper can jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current cell, to the left or to the right. However, the program only checks for the path from 'G' to 'T' by jumping to the right. 

When the program swaps the positions of 'G' and 'T' if the original index of 'G' is greater than the original index of 'T', it ensures that 'G' is always to the left of 'T'. Then, it checks for the path from 'G' to 'T' by jumping to the right with a step size of k. 

However, this approach is incorrect because it does not consider the case where the grasshopper needs to jump to the left to reach 'T'. 

For example, consider the input:
```
6 2
T....G
```
In this case, the program will swap the positions of 'G' and 'T' and then check for the path from 'T' to 'G' by jumping to the right. However, the grasshopper needs to jump to the left to reach 'T', which the program does not consider. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and its correctness is **False**. 

To fix this issue, the program needs to be modified to consider both left and right jumps. 

Here is a modified version of the program:
```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    visited = set()
    queue = [(G_pos, 0)]

    while queue:
        pos, step = queue.pop(0)
        if pos == T_pos:
            print('YES')
            return
        if pos in visited:
            continue
        visited.add(pos)

        for new_pos in [pos + k, pos - k]:
            if 0 <= new_pos < n and line[new_pos]!= '#':
                queue.append((new_pos, step + 1))

    print('NO')
```
This modified program uses a breadth-first search (BFS) approach to check for the path from 'G' to 'T' by considering both left and right jumps. It uses a queue to keep track of the positions to visit and a set to keep track of the visited positions. If it finds a path from 'G' to 'T', it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
