Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T' or the original index of 'T` otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'G' otherwise, `G_pos` must be less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is `False`, and `pos` is `G_pos`. If the character at the current position `pos` in `line` is '#', the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues execution.***
