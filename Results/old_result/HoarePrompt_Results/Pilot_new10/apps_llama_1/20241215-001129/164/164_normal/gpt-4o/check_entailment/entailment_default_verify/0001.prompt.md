You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: On the way to Rio de Janeiro Ostap kills time playing with a grasshopper he took with him in a special box. Ostap builds a line of length n such that some cells of this line are empty and some contain obstacles. Then, he places his grasshopper to one of the empty cells and a small insect in another empty cell. The grasshopper wants to eat the insect.

Ostap knows that grasshopper is able to jump to any empty cell that is exactly k cells away from the current (to the left or to the right). Note that it doesn't matter whether intermediate cells are empty or not as the grasshopper makes a jump over them. For example, if k = 1 the grasshopper can jump to a neighboring cell only, and if k = 2 the grasshopper can jump over a single cell.

Your goal is to determine whether there is a sequence of jumps such that grasshopper will get from his initial position to the cell with an insect.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains two integers n and k (2 ≤ n ≤ 100, 1 ≤ k ≤ n - 1) — the number of cells in the line and the length of one grasshopper's jump.

The second line contains a string of length n consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G' and 'T'. Character '.' means that the corresponding cell is empty, character '#' means that the corresponding cell contains an obstacle and grasshopper can't jump there. Character 'G' means that the grasshopper starts at this position and, finally, 'T' means that the target insect is located at this cell. It's guaranteed that characters 'G' and 'T' appear in this line exactly once.


-----Output-----

If there exists a sequence of jumps (each jump of length k), such that the grasshopper can get from his initial position to the cell with the insect, print "YES" (without quotes) in the only line of the input. Otherwise, print "NO" (without quotes).


-----Examples-----
Input
5 2
#G#T#

Output
YES

Input
6 1
T....G

Output
YES

Input
7 3
T..#..G

Output
NO

Input
6 2
..GT..

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample, the grasshopper can make one jump to the right in order to get from cell 2 to cell 4.

In the second sample, the grasshopper is only able to jump to neighboring cells but the way to the insect is free — he can get there by jumping left 5 times.

In the third sample, the grasshopper can't make a single jump.

In the fourth sample, the grasshopper can only jump to the cells with odd indices, thus he won't be able to reach the insect.
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    if G_pos > T_pos:
        (G_pos, T_pos) = (T_pos, G_pos)
    reachable = False
    for pos in range(G_pos, T_pos + 1, k):
        if line[pos] == '#':
            break
        if pos == T_pos:
            reachable = True
            break
    if reachable:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly implement the logic to determine whether the grasshopper can reach the target insect. The issue lies in the fact that the program only checks if the target insect is reachable by jumping from the grasshopper's position to the target insect's position in steps of `k`, but it does not consider the case where the grasshopper can jump to a position that is not in the direct path from the grasshopper's position to the target insect's position.

A counterexample to the program is the input:

```
8 3
G...#...T
```

In this case, the program will output 'NO' because it cannot reach the target insect by jumping in steps of 3 from the grasshopper's position. However, the correct output should be 'YES' because the grasshopper can jump to the position 3 steps to the right, then jump to the position 3 steps to the right again, and finally jump to the target insect's position.

To correctly solve this problem, a breadth-first search (BFS) algorithm should be used to explore all possible positions that the grasshopper can reach by jumping in steps of `k`.

Here's a correct implementation in Python:

```python
from collections import deque

def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    line = input()
    G_pos = line.index('G')
    T_pos = line.index('T')
    queue = deque([G_pos])
    visited = {G_pos}
    
    while queue:
        pos = queue.popleft()
        if pos == T_pos:
            print('YES')
            return
        for new_pos in [pos - k, pos + k]:
            if 0 <= new_pos < n and new_pos not in visited and line[new_pos]!= '#':
                queue.append(new_pos)
                visited.add(new_pos)
    print('NO')

func()
```

This implementation uses a BFS algorithm to explore all possible positions that the grasshopper can reach by jumping in steps of `k`, and it correctly determines whether the target insect is reachable.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` and a string of length `n` with specific character constraints through standard input, and prints 'YES' if there is a path from 'G' to 'T' with a step size of `k` without encountering '#', and 'NO' otherwise, assuming 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string and `k` is a valid step size. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
