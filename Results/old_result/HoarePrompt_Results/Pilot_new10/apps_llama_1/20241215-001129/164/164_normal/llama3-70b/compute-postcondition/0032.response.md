The function func accepts two inputs: two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, and `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, and a string `s` of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once. It attempts to find the indices `g` and `t` of 'G' and 'T' in the string `s`. 

If 'G' or 'T' is not found in `s`, it prints 'NO'. Otherwise, it checks if the absolute difference between the indices `t` and `g` is a multiple of `k` and if the substring of `s` from `g` to `t` (or `t` to `g`), stepping by `k`, contains no '#' characters. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. 

The function does not handle cases where the input is not in the correct format or where 'G' or 'T' appears more than once. It also does not handle cases where `n` or `k` is outside the specified range. The function assumes that the input is well-formed.

Functionality: ** The function reads two lines of input, the first line containing two positive integers `n` and `k`, and the second line a string of length `n` with specific characters, and it prints 'YES' if the absolute difference between the indices of 'G' and 'T' is a multiple of `k` and the substring of `s` from `g` to `t` (or `t` to `g`), stepping by `k`, contains no '#' characters; otherwise, it prints 'NO', assuming the input is well-formed and 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string. **
