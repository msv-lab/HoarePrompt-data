The code assigns the values of `n` and `k` from the input. The input consists of two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, and `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`. 

`n` is assigned the value of the first integer from the input and `k` is assigned the value of the second integer from the input.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, and the second line of the input is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, the second line of the input is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once.**
