The function accepts two integers `n` and `k` and a string of length `n` with specific character constraints through standard input, and prints 'YES' if there is a path from 'G' to 'T' with a step size of `k` without encountering '#', and 'NO' otherwise, assuming 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once in the string and `k` is a valid step size.
