Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once. If the original index of 'G' was greater than the original index of 'T', then `G_pos` is updated to the original index of 'T' and `T_pos` is updated to the original index of 'G`. Otherwise, `G_pos` and `T_pos` remain the original indices of 'G' and 'T' respectively.**
