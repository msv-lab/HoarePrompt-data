Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'T` otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T` if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'G` otherwise, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`. If `pos` equals `T_pos`, then `reachable` is `True`, `pos` is equal to `T_pos`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `pos` is not equal to `T_pos`, the program state remains unchanged, unless the character at the current position `pos` in `line` is '#', in which case the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
