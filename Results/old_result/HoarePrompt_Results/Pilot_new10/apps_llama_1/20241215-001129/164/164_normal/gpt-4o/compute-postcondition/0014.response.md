The `break` statement does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement that we were directly inside. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'T` otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T` if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'G` otherwise, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is `True`, and `pos` is equal to `T_pos`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer greater than 0, `line` is the input string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `G_pos` is the original index of 'G' if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'T` otherwise, `T_pos` is the original index of 'T` if the original index of 'G' is less than or equal to the original index of 'T` or the original index of 'G` otherwise, `G_pos` is less than or equal to `T_pos`, `reachable` is `True`, `pos` is equal to `T_pos`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
