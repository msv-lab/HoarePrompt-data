Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description. 

The issue lies in the line `if (abs(t - g) % k == 0 and all(s[(g + i * k) % n]!= '#' for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1))) :`. 

This line checks if the absolute difference between the positions of the grasshopper and the target insect is a multiple of the jump length `k`, and if all the cells that the grasshopper would jump over (including the target insect's cell) are not obstacles. 

However, this line does not correctly handle the case where the grasshopper needs to jump in the opposite direction of the target insect. The line `(g + i * k) % n` should be replaced with `(g + i * k) if (t > g) else (g - i * k)` to correctly calculate the position of each cell the grasshopper would jump over.

Additionally, the use of the modulo operator `%` in `(g + i * k) % n` assumes that the jump wraps around the line, which is not specified in the problem description. 

To fix this issue, the program should be modified to check both directions of jumps separately, without using the modulo operator, and to correctly handle the case where the grasshopper needs to jump in the opposite direction of the target insect.

Here's an example of how the corrected code could look:
```python
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    g, t = -1, -1
    for i in range(n):
        if s[i] == 'G':
            g = i
        elif s[i] == 'T':
            t = i

    if (g == -1 or t == -1) :
        print('NO')
    else :
        if abs(t - g) % k == 0:
            if t > g:
                jump_positions = [g + i * k for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)]
            else:
                jump_positions = [g - i * k for i in range(abs(t - g) // k + 1)]
            if all(0 <= pos < n and s[pos]!= '#' for pos in jump_positions):
                print('YES')
            else:
                print('NO')
        else:
            print('NO')
```
