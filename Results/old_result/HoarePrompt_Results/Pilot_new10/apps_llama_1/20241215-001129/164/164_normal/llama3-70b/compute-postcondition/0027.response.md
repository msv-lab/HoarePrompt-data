Postcondition: **`n` is a positive integer from 2 to 100, `k` is a positive integer from 1 to `n-1`, `s` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters '.', '#', 'G', and 'T', where 'G' and 'T' appear exactly once, `g` is the index of 'G' in `s`, `t` is the index of 'T' in `s`, and both `g` and `t` are not equal to -1, indicating that 'G' and 'T' are present in the string `s`. either `abs(t - g)` is not a multiple of `k` or there exists at least one index `i` in the range from 0 to `abs(t - g) // k` (inclusive) such that `s[(g + i * k) % n]` is '#'**
