You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if max_color_count <= k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program seems to be correct for all potential cases as described in the problem. It maps the input into a dictionary, where keys are the colors of the balloons and values are the number of balloons of each color. It then checks if the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to the number of friends (k). 

The logic behind this approach is that if the maximum count of any color is greater than the number of friends, then at least one friend will have to receive more than one balloon of the same color, which violates the condition. 

On the other hand, if the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to the number of friends, then it is possible to distribute the balloons such that no friend receives more than one balloon of the same color. This is because we can give all the balloons of one color to one friend, and then give the balloons of the next color to another friend, and so on.

For example, if we have 4 balloons of 2 different colors (e.g., "aabb") and 2 friends, the program will correctly output "YES". If we have 6 balloons of 2 different colors (e.g., "aacaab") and 3 friends, the program will correctly output "NO".

This solution works because it considers the worst-case scenario (i.e., the color with the most balloons), and checks if that scenario is still within the limits of the number of friends we have. If it is, then all other scenarios will also be within the limits. 

I couldn't think of any case where this program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of balloons, k is a positive integer representing the number of friends, and s is a string of length n containing only lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet, where each letter represents the color of a balloon.
def func():
    n, k = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `c` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, otherwise `c` is undefined, and `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and the value associated with each key is the frequency of that character in `s`.
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if (max_color_count <= k) :
        print('YES')
    else :
        print('NO')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `c` is the last character in `s` if `s` is not empty, otherwise `c` is undefined, `color_count` is a dictionary where each key is a unique character from `s` and the value associated with each key is the frequency of that character in `s`, and `max_color_count` is the maximum value in `color_count.values()`. If `max_color_count` is less than or equal to `k`, 'YES' has been printed to the output. Otherwise, 'NO' has been printed to the console.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
