Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 1 character, `c` is the first character in the string `s`. If `c` is already a key in `color_count`, then `color_count` is a dictionary where `c` is a key with a value that is at least 2. Otherwise, `color_count` is a dictionary with `c` as a key and 1 as its value.**
