Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `s` is an input string that must have at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character in the string `s`. If `c` was already a key in `color_count`, then `color_count` is a dictionary where `c` is a key with a value that is at least 2 and `color_count[c]` is incremented by 1 from its initial value if the initial value is at least 2, or `color_count[c]` is set to 2 if the initial value is less than 2. If `c` was not already a key in `color_count`, then `color_count` is a dictionary where `c` is a key with a value of 1.***
