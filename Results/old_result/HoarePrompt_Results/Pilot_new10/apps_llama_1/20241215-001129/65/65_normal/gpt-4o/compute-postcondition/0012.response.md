Postcondition: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 100, `s` is a string of length `n` with at least 1 character, `color` is the second character in the string `s`, and `color_count` is a dictionary where the count of the first character has been incremented or added, and if `color` is already in `color_count`, then the count of `color` has also been incremented or added, otherwise `color_count[color]` is 1**
