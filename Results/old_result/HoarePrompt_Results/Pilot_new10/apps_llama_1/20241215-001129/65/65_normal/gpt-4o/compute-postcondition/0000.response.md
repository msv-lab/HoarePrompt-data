The values of `n` and `k` are updated based on the input. The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of substrings separated by spaces, and `map(int,...)` converts these substrings to integers. 

The previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the new values. The string `s` is not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= k <= 100, and are assigned values from the input, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase letters of the Latin alphabet, where the length of `s` should be `n`**
