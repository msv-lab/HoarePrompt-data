You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: One day Kefa found n baloons. For convenience, we denote color of i-th baloon as s_{i} — lowercase letter of the Latin alphabet. Also Kefa has k friends. Friend will be upset, If he get two baloons of the same color. Kefa want to give out all baloons to his friends. Help Kefa to find out, can he give out all his baloons, such that no one of his friens will be upset — print «YES», if he can, and «NO», otherwise. Note, that Kefa's friend will not upset, if he doesn't get baloons at all.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 100) — the number of baloons and friends.

Next line contains string s — colors of baloons.


-----Output-----

Answer to the task — «YES» or «NO» in a single line.

You can choose the case (lower or upper) for each letter arbitrary.


-----Examples-----
Input
4 2
aabb

Output
YES

Input
6 3
aacaab

Output
NO



-----Note-----

In the first sample Kefa can give 1-st and 3-rd baloon to the first friend, and 2-nd and 4-th to the second.

In the second sample Kefa needs to give to all his friends baloons of color a, but one baloon will stay, thats why answer is «NO».
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, k) = map(int, input().split())
    s = input()
    color_count = {}
    for c in s:
        if c in color_count:
            color_count[c] += 1
        else:
            color_count[c] = 1
    max_color_count = max(color_count.values())
    if max_color_count <= k:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly in all cases. The issue with the program is that it checks if the maximum count of any color is less than or equal to the number of friends, which is not sufficient to determine if all balloons can be distributed.

For example, if there are 3 friends and 4 balloons with colors 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', the program will print 'NO' because the maximum count of any color is 1, which is less than 3, but the total number of balloons is 4, which is more than 3. However, it is still possible to distribute the balloons to the 3 friends, with each friend getting one or more balloons of different colors.

Another example is if there are 3 friends and 4 balloons with colors 'a', 'a', 'b', 'b', the program will print 'YES' because the maximum count of any color is 2, which is less than 3. However, it is not possible to distribute the balloons to the 3 friends, with no friend getting two balloons of the same color.

A correct solution would be to check if the total number of balloons can be distributed to the friends such that no friend gets two balloons of the same color. This can be done by counting the number of colors and checking if it is less than or equal to the number of friends. If the number of colors is less than or equal to the number of friends, then the balloons can be distributed. If the number of colors is more than the number of friends, then it is not possible to distribute the balloons.

Here is an incorrect case: 

Input:
5 3
abcde

Output:
NO 

However the correct output should be YES, since we can distribute the 5 balloons to 3 friends with the first friend having 'a', 'b' the second friend having 'c', 'd' and the third having 'e'. The original program fails this case. 

Note that we can distribute the balloons if for each color the count of the color is less than or equal to the number of friends, but this condition is not sufficient for the balloons to be distributed among the friends.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts the number of balloons `n`, the number of friends `k`, and a string `s` representing balloon colors, and prints 'YES' if the maximum frequency of any color is less than or equal to `k`, or 'NO' otherwise, without input validation or error handling. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
