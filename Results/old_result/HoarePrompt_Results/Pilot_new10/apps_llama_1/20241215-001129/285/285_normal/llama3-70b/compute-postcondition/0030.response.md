Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `1234567 + 123456`, `a` is 1, `b` is 1, `c` is `(n - 1357123) // 1234`. If `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, then 'YES' is printed to the console and the program is terminated. Otherwise, the program state remains unchanged, with no specific action taken.***
