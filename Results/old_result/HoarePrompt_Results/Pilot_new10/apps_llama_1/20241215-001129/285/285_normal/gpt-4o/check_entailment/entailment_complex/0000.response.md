Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description. It checks every possible combination of houses, cars, and computers that can sum up to the initial game-coin score `n`. The use of nested loops allows the function to explore all possible combinations of `a`, `b`, and `c` that satisfy the equation `a * house_cost + b * car_cost + c * computer_cost = n`.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. The program iterates over all possible values of `a` (number of houses) from `0` to `n // house_cost`. This ensures that all possible combinations of houses are considered.
2. For each value of `a`, the program calculates the remaining game-coin score after buying `a` houses (`remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost`).
3. The program then iterates over all possible values of `b` (number of cars) from `0` to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost`. This ensures that all possible combinations of cars are considered given the remaining game-coin score after buying houses.
4. For each value of `b`, the program calculates the remaining game-coin score after buying `a` houses and `b` cars (`remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost`).
5. The program checks if the remaining game-coin score after buying houses and cars is a multiple of the cost of a computer (`remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0`). If it is, the program returns `'YES'`, indicating that a valid combination of houses, cars, and computers has been found.
6. If no valid combination is found after exploring all possible values of `a` and `b`, the program returns `'NO'`, indicating that it is not possible to represent `n` as a linear combination of the given costs with non-negative integer coefficients.

The program's logic is sound, and it covers all possible cases where `n` can or cannot be represented as a linear combination of the given costs with non-negative integer coefficients. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
