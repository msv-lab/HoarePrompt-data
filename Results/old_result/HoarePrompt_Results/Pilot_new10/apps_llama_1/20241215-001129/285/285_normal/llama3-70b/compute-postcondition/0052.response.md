The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately, so no further code is executed. The values of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as well as the conditions `n - 2 * 1234567 >= 0` and `(n - 2 * 1234567) // 123456 + 1 >= 3`. The message 'YES' has already been printed to the console. Since the program terminates, no new variables are introduced, and no existing variables are modified.

Output State: **`n` is the original input integer, `a` is 2, `b` is 2, `n - 2 * 1234567 >= 0`, `(n - 2 * 1234567) // 123456 + 1 >= 3`, `c` is `(n - 2 * 1234567 - 2 * 123456) // 1234`, 'YES' has been printed to the console, and the program has terminated**
