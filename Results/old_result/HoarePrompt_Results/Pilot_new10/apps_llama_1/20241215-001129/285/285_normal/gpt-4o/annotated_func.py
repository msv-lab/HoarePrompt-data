#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer greater than or equal to 1, representing the initial game-coin score, such that there are non-negative integers a, b, and c satisfying the equation a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234 = n.
def func_1(n):
    house_cost = 1234567
    car_cost = 123456
    computer_cost = 1234
    for a in range(n // house_cost + 1):
        remaining_after_houses = n - a * house_cost
        
        for b in range(remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1):
            remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
            if remaining_after_cars % computer_cost == 0:
                return 'YES'
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, and either a valid combination of `a`, `b`, and `c` exists such that `a * house_cost + b * car_cost + c * computer_cost = n` (in which case the function returns `'YES'`), or no such combination exists (in which case the function does not return `'YES'`).
    return 'NO'
    #The program returns 'NO'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and attempts to find a combination of houses, cars, and computers that sums up to `n` using their respective costs. It returns `'YES'` if such a combination exists and `'NO'` otherwise, covering all possible cases where `n` can or cannot be represented as a linear combination of the given costs with non-negative integer coefficients.
