To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `house_cost` is `1234567`.
- `car_cost` is `123456`.
- `computer_cost` is `1234`.
- `a` is 0.
- `b` is 1.
- `remaining_after_houses` is at least 0.
- `remaining_after_cars` equals `remaining_after_houses` and is at least 0.
- `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` is not equal to 0.

The code provided is:
```python
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - b * car_cost
```
Given that `b` is 1 and `car_cost` is `123456`, the equation simplifies to:
```python
remaining_after_cars = remaining_after_houses - 123456
```
This means `remaining_after_cars` is updated to be the value of `remaining_after_houses` minus `123456`.

The conditions that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `a` is 0, and `b` is 1 do not change. The value of `remaining_after_houses` is also not changed by this operation; it remains at least 0.

However, the new value of `remaining_after_cars` is now `remaining_after_houses - 123456`. Since `remaining_after_houses` is at least 0, `remaining_after_cars` could potentially be negative depending on the exact value of `remaining_after_houses`. The condition that `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` is not equal to 0 may still hold, but it depends on the new value of `remaining_after_cars`.

The output state, considering the updates, is:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1.
- `house_cost` is `1234567`.
- `car_cost` is `123456`.
- `computer_cost` is `1234`.
- `a` is 0.
- `b` is 1.
- `remaining_after_houses` is at least 0.
- `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - 123456`.
- The condition that `remaining_after_cars` modulo `computer_cost` is not equal to 0 may or may not hold after the update, depending on the exact value of `remaining_after_houses`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `a` is 0, `b` is 1, `remaining_after_houses` is at least 0, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - 123456`.**
