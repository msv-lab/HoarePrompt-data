The given code simply prints 'YES' and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `c` remain the same. The expression `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` still equals `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is 0, `b` is 0, `c` is `n // 1234`, and `a * 1234567 + b * 123456 + c * 1234` equals `n`, and 'YES' has been printed**
