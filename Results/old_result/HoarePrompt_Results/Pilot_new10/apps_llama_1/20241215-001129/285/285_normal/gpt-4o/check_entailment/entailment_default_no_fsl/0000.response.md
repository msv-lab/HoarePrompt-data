Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks all possible combinations of houses, cars, and computers that can sum up to the given initial game-coin score `n`. 

Here's why I think the code is correct:

1. **Iterating over all possible house purchases**: The code starts by iterating over all possible house purchases using a loop that ranges from 0 to `n // house_cost + 1`. This ensures that all possible numbers of houses that can be bought are considered.

2. **Iterating over all possible car purchases given the remaining coins**: After purchasing a certain number of houses, the code calculates the remaining coins and then iterates over all possible car purchases using a loop that ranges from 0 to `remaining_after_houses // car_cost + 1`. This ensures that all possible numbers of cars that can be bought are considered given the remaining coins.

3. **Checking if the remaining coins can be used to buy computers**: Finally, after purchasing houses and cars, the code checks if the remaining coins can be used to buy computers by checking if `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`. If it is, the code returns `'YES'`, indicating that a combination of houses, cars, and computers can sum up to `n`.

4. **Examples and edge cases**: I have checked the code against the provided examples, and it produces the correct output for both examples. Additionally, I have considered edge cases where `n` is less than the cost of a house, a car, or a computer, and the code correctly handles these cases.

Therefore, I believe that the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and should produce the correct output for all possible inputs.
