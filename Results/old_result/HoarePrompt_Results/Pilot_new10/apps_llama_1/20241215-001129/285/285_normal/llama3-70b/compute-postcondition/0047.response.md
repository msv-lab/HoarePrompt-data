The `exit()` function terminates the program immediately. The values of the variables do not change, but the program stops executing. 

Output State: **`n` is the original input integer, `a` is 2, `b` is 1, `n - 2 * 1234567 >= 0`, `(n - 2 * 1234567) // 123456 + 1 >= 2`, `c` is `(n - 2 * 1234567 - 123456) // 1234`, 'YES' has been printed, and the program has been terminated**
