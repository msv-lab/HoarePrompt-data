Postcondition: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `house_cost` is `1234567`, `car_cost` is `123456`, `computer_cost` is `1234`, `a` is 0, `b` is 2, `remaining_after_houses` is at least `2 * car_cost`, `remaining_after_cars` is `remaining_after_houses - 2 * car_cost`. If `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`, the program returns the string 'YES'. Otherwise, no value is returned.**
