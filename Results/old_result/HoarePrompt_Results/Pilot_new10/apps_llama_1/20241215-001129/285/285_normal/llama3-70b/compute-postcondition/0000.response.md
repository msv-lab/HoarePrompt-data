The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^9. However, this information becomes irrelevant after executing the given code because `n` is reassigned a new value based on the user's input.

The code `n = int(input())` takes an input from the user, converts it to an integer using `int()`, and assigns this integer value to `n`. This means the original range or value of `n` (1 <= n <= 10^9) is overwritten by the new integer input by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer**
