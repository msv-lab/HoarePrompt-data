Correctness: **True**

The given program is correct and accurately determines whether Kolya's initial game-coin score can be spent buying houses, cars, and computers. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization and Input**: The program starts by reading Kolya's initial game-coin score `n` from the input.

2. **Function `func_1`**: This function attempts to find a combination of houses, cars, and computers that sums up to `n`. The function iterates through all possible numbers of houses (`a`) that can be bought with `n` coins, calculates the remaining coins after buying houses, and then iterates through all possible numbers of cars (`b`) that can be bought with the remaining coins. 

3. **Checking Combinations**: If the remaining coins after buying houses and cars can be exactly spent on computers (i.e., `remaining_after_cars` is divisible by `computer_cost`), it means a valid combination is found, and the function returns 'YES'.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function also handles edge cases where `n` is less than the cost of any item. In such cases, it simply returns 'NO' after the loops finish without finding a valid combination.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result of `func_1`, which is either 'YES' or 'NO', depending on whether a valid combination is found or not.

The program's approach ensures that it checks all possible combinations of buying houses, cars, and computers, thus accurately determining whether Kolya's initial game-coin score can be spent buying these items. 

Since all potential cases are handled, and the program's logic aligns with the problem description, the program is correct.
