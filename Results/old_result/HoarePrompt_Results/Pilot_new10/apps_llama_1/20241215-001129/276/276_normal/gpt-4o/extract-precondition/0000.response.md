The given function definition is incomplete as it only takes one string `s` as an argument, whereas the problem description requires comparing two numbers written in golden system notation. A more suitable function definition would be:

```python
def func_1(s1, s2):
```

Precondition: **s1 and s2 are non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000.**
