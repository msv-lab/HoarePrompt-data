`s1` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `s2` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `q` is `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))`, `n` is either `len(s1)` or `len(s2)` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2. 

The value of `value` becomes `value + q ** (n - i - 1)`, where `q` is `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))` and `n` is either `len(s1)` or `len(s2)`. Since `i` is 2, `n - i - 1` is `n - 3`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

`value` is increased by `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2)) ** (n - 3)`, where `n` is either `len(s1)` or `len(s2)`.

Output State: **`s1` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `s2` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `q` is `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))`, `n` is either `len(s1)` or `len(s2)` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `value` is increased by `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2)) ** (n - 3)`**
