The original assessment states that the provided Python program accurately implements the golden system notation comparison as described in the problem statement. Upon reviewing the code and the problem description, it appears that the program correctly calculates the decimal values of the two input numbers and compares them.

The output hints confirm that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal value of a given golden system number, which is the sum of weighted '1's, where each '1' is weighted by the golden ratio raised to the power of its position from the end of the string.

The problem description requires the comparison of two numbers written in golden system notation. The program correctly implements this comparison using the calculated decimal values of the two input numbers.

The original assessment thoroughly breaks down the program's correctness, covering input handling, decimal value calculation, and comparison. The provided examples in the problem statement also demonstrate the correctness of the program for different inputs.

Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program correctly implements the required functionality.

Final: **True**
