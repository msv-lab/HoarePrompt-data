Postcondition: **`s1` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `s2` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `q` is equal to `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))`, `n` is greater than 0 and is either `len(s1)` or `len(s2)`, `i` is 0, if `s[i]` equals '1', then `value` is `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))`, otherwise `value` remains 0**
