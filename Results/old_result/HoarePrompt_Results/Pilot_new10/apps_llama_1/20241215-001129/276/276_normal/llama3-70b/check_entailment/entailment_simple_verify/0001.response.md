The original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**. The annotated version of the code also confirms this assessment.

The program correctly calculates the decimal equivalents of the two input numbers in the golden system notation and then compares them to determine which number has a larger decimal value.

The function `func_1(s)` correctly calculates the decimal equivalent of a number in the golden system notation by multiplying each digit by the corresponding power of `q` and summing these values.

The program then compares the decimal equivalents of the two numbers using simple conditional statements and prints the correct comparison result (`>`, `<`, or `=`) based on the comparison.

The annotated version of the code also confirms that the program correctly handles the input strings and calculates the decimal values as expected.

One potential issue could be the precision of the floating-point calculations, but since the input lengths are limited to 100000, the calculations should be accurate enough to determine the correct comparison result.

Therefore, based on the problem description, the original code, and the annotated version, the program correctly implements the functionality to compare two numbers in the golden system notation.

Final: **True**
