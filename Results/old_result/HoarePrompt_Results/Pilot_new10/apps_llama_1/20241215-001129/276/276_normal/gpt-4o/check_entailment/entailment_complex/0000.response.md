Correctness: **True**

The program is correct and follows the problem description. Here's why:

1. The problem requires comparing two numbers in the "golden system" notation, which are non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters. The program accepts two such strings as input, `s1` and `s2`, and calculates their decimal values using the function `func_1`.

2. The function `func_1` calculates the decimal value of a given string `s` in the golden system notation. It uses the golden ratio `q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2` and calculates the sum of weighted '1's in the string, where each '1' is weighted by `q` raised to the power of its position from the end of the string.

3. The program then compares the decimal values of `s1` and `s2` and prints '>' if `s1` is larger, '<' if `s1` is smaller, and '=' if they are equal. This is in accordance with the problem description.

4. The program handles all potential cases, including strings of different lengths and strings with leading zeros. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the decimal value of each string, regardless of its length or the distribution of '1's and '0's.

5. The annotations in the code provide additional information about the state of the program before and after the function call, and the overall behavior of the function. These annotations are consistent with the problem description and the code.

In conclusion, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and correctly compares two numbers in the golden system notation. It handles all potential cases and provides the correct output for every possible input. Therefore, the program is correct.
