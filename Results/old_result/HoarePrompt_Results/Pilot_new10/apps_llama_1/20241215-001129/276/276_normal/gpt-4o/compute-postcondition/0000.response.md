The code calculates the value of `q` using the formula `(5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2`, which is a mathematical constant representing the golden ratio. 

The value of `q` is approximately 1.618033988749895, but more precisely, it is equal to `(5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2`. 

The states of the other variables, `s1` and `s2`, are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000, `q` is equal to `(5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2`.

Output State: **`s1` and `s2` are non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000, `q` is equal to `(5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2`**
