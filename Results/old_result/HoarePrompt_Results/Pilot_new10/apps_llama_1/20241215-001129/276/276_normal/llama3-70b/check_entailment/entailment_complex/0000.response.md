Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the problem description. Here's why:

1.  The problem asks for a comparison of two numbers in the "golden system" notation. The program reads two lines of input, each representing a number in this notation.
2.  It defines a function `func_1` to convert these numbers from the golden system to decimal. This function calculates the decimal value using the formula provided in the problem description, where `q = (math.sqrt(5) + 1) / 2` and the decimal value is `âˆ‘a_i * q^(n-i)`.
3.  The program calculates the decimal values of both input numbers using `func_1` and then compares these values to determine which number is larger.
4.  The comparison is done correctly according to the problem description: if the first number is larger, it prints '>'; if the second number is larger, it prints '<'; and if the numbers are equal, it prints '='.

The program handles the cases mentioned in the problem description and the examples provided correctly. It also handles the calculation of the decimal values for the golden system numbers as per the given formula.

One thing to note is that the problem description does not specify what to do if the input strings contain characters other than '0' and '1', or if they are empty. However, based on the examples and the overall problem statement, it is reasonable to assume that the input will always be non-empty strings consisting only of '0' and '1' characters, each with a length not exceeding 100000.

In the provided code, if the input string contains characters other than '0' and '1', the `int(c)` conversion in the line `decimal += int(c) * q ** i` will raise a `ValueError`. While this behavior is not explicitly specified in the problem description, it can be considered a reasonable way to handle such invalid inputs. 

However, it does not enforce the length constraint of 100000 characters, but since the problem statement guarantees that the input length will not exceed 100000, the program will still produce the correct results for the given constraints. 

Therefore, the program accurately implements the requirements specified in the problem description, and it will produce the correct results for all valid inputs.
