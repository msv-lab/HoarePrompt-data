Based on the provided code and output hints, I believe the original assessment is accurate.

The code correctly implements the golden system notation and compares the decimal values of two input numbers. The `func_1` function accurately calculates the decimal value of a number written in the golden system notation by iterating over each digit in the string and adding the corresponding power of `q` to the total value for each '1'.

The output hints confirm that the `func_1` function works as expected, returning the sum of weighted '1's in the input string, where each '1' is weighted by the golden ratio raised to the power of its position from the end of the string.

The code handles the comparison of the two input numbers correctly, printing '>' if the first number is larger, '<' if it is smaller, and '=' if they are equal.

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct.

Final: **True**
