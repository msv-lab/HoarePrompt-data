According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` is increased by 1, so `i` is 2 and for the loop to execute again `n` must be greater than 2.
State: **`s1` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `s2` is a non-empty string consisting of '0' and '1' characters with a length not exceeding 100000, `q` is `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))`, `n` is either `len(s1)` or `len(s2)` and is greater than 2, `i` is 2**
