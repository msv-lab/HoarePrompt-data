Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the golden system notation comparison as described in the problem description. Here's a breakdown of why it's correct:

1. The program calculates the decimal value of each input number using the formula provided in the problem description: `decimal = sum(a_i * q^(n-i))`, where `q` is the golden ratio `(sqrt(5) + 1) / 2`, `a_i` is the `i-th` digit of the number, and `n` is the length of the number.

2. The `func_1` function takes a string `s` as input and returns the decimal value of the number represented by `s` in the golden system notation. This is done by iterating over the characters in the reversed string, multiplying each character by the corresponding power of `q`, and adding the results to the `decimal` variable.

3. The program compares the decimal values of the two input numbers using the `if-elif-else` statement and prints the correct comparison result (`>`, `<`, or `=`).

The program correctly handles the problem description's requirements, including:

* The input strings are non-empty and consist only of '0' and '1' characters, each with a length not exceeding 100000.
* The program calculates the decimal value of each input number using the correct formula.
* The program compares the decimal values of the two input numbers and prints the correct comparison result.

Overall, the program implements the correct logic to compare two numbers in the golden system notation, as described in the problem description, and therefore is correct.
