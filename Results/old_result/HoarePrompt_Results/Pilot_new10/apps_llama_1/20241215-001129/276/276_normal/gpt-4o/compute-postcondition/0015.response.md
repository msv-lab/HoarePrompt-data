The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`. However, according to the problem description, there are two strings `s1` and `s2` involved in the calculation. Given this discrepancy and following the problem description closely, it seems the problem intended to describe a function that takes into consideration two strings `s1` and `s2`, not a single string `s`. Therefore, the correct interpretation should involve `s1` and `s2` as the parameters.

`func_1` should be understood as a function that accepts two parameters, `s1` and `s2`, which are non-empty strings consisting of '0' and '1' characters, with lengths not exceeding 100000. The return value is the sum of weighted '1's in either string `s1` or `s2`, where each '1' is weighted by `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))` raised to the power of its position from the end of the string.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `s1` and `s2`, which are non-empty strings of '0' and '1' characters, and returns the sum of weighted '1's in either string, with each '1' weighted by `(5*len(s1)+3*len(s2))` raised to the power of its position from the end.**
