Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the decimal value of the numbers represented in the golden system notation and compares them correctly.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of why the program meets the problem description:

1. The program reads two strings `s1` and `s2` from the input, which represent the numbers in the golden system notation.
2. The `func_1` function calculates the decimal value of a given string `s` in the golden system notation. It does this by iterating over each character `s[i]` in the string, and if the character is '1', it adds the corresponding power of `q` to the `value`. The power of `q` is calculated as `n - i - 1`, where `n` is the length of the string and `i` is the current index. This is consistent with the problem description, which states that the decimal value of the expression `a_0a_1...a_{n}` equals to $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.
3. The program calculates the decimal values of `s1` and `s2` using the `func_1` function and stores them in `value1` and `value2`, respectively.
4. The program compares `value1` and `value2` and prints the correct comparison result ('>', '<', or '=') based on their values.

The program correctly handles all cases, including:

* Numbers with different lengths
* Numbers with leading zeros
* Numbers with trailing zeros
* Numbers with no zeros or no ones

The program's calculation of the decimal value is also correct, as it uses the formula provided in the problem description. The use of `q = (5 ** 0.5 + 1) / 2` is also correct, as this is the value of `q` mentioned in the problem description.

Overall, the program accurately implements the golden system notation and correctly compares the decimal values of the input numbers, making it consistent with the problem description.
