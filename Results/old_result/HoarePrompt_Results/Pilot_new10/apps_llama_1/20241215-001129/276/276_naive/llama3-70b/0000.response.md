Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the comparison of two numbers written in the golden system notation. It first calculates the decimal value of each number using the formula provided in the problem description, and then compares these decimal values to determine which number is larger.

The function `func_1` calculates the decimal value of a given number in the golden system notation. It uses the formula `q^i` where `q` is the golden ratio and `i` is the position of the digit in the number (starting from 0 for the rightmost digit). The function correctly sums up the contributions of each digit to the decimal value.

The main part of the program reads two numbers from the input, calculates their decimal values using `func_1`, and then compares these decimal values to print the correct comparison result.

The program correctly handles all potential cases, including numbers of different lengths and numbers with different digit values. It does not have any missing logic or edge cases that it does not handle.

The example inputs provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program, and it produces the expected output for each example.

Overall, the program is correct and should produce the expected output for all possible inputs.
