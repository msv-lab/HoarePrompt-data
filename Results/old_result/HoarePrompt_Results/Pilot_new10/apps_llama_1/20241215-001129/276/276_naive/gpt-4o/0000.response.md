Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately compares two numbers written in the golden system notation and prints whether the first number is larger, smaller, or equal to the second number.

Here's an explanation of why the code is correct:

1. The `func_1` function calculates the decimal value of a number written in the golden system notation. It does this by iterating over each digit in the string, and for each '1', it adds the corresponding power of `q` to the total value.

2. The powers of `q` are calculated as `q ** (n - i - 1)`, where `n` is the length of the string and `i` is the current index. This corresponds to the formula provided in the problem description: $\sum_{i = 0}^{n} a_{i} \cdot q^{n - i}$.

3. The program then compares the decimal values of the two input numbers and prints the correct output based on the comparison.

After reviewing the code, I was unable to find any potential cases where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The program correctly handles the conversion from the golden system to decimal and makes the correct comparisons between the two input numbers. 

Therefore, the code appears to be correct for all possible inputs.
