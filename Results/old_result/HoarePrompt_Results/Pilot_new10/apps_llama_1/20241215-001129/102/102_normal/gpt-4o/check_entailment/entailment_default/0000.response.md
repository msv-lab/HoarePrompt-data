Correctness: **True**

The provided code appears to correctly solve the problem as described. It takes the amount of money Vasya has (n), the cost of a bottle of Ber-Cola (a), and the cost of a Bars bar (b) as input. It then attempts to find integer values x and y such that n = a*x + b*y. If such a combination exists, it prints "YES" along with the values of x and y; otherwise, it prints "NO".

The code uses a simple iterative approach to check all possible combinations of x and y. The loop iterates over all possible values of x (from 0 to n//a), and for each x, it checks if (n - x*a) is divisible by b. If it is, then y = (n - x*a) // b is an integer, and the equation n = a*x + b*y is satisfied.

The code handles all positive integers n, a, and b as specified in the problem description. The specified upper limit of 10,000,000 for n, a, and b is not explicitly enforced in the code, but it is not necessary to do so, as the code's behavior is well-defined for all positive integers.

The provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the code. For instance, the first example with n = 7, a = 2, and b = 3 correctly outputs "YES" with x = 2 and y = 1, as 2*2 + 1*3 = 7.

The output hints agree with the code's behavior, and no cases were found where the code does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is considered correct.
