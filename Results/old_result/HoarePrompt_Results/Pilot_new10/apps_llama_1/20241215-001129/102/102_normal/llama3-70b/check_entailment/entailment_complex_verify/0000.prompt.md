You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has n burles. One bottle of Ber-Cola costs a burles and one Bars bar costs b burles. He can buy any non-negative integer number of bottles of Ber-Cola and any non-negative integer number of Bars bars.

Find out if it's possible to buy some amount of bottles of Ber-Cola and Bars bars and spend exactly n burles.

In other words, you should find two non-negative integers x and y such that Vasya can buy x bottles of Ber-Cola and y Bars bars and x·a + y·b = n or tell that it's impossible.


-----Input-----

First line contains single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000 000) — amount of money, that Vasya has.

Second line contains single integer a (1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola.

Third line contains single integer b (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000) — cost of one Bars bar.


-----Output-----

If Vasya can't buy Bars and Ber-Cola in such a way to spend exactly n burles print «NO» (without quotes).

Otherwise in first line print «YES» (without quotes). In second line print two non-negative integers x and y — number of bottles of Ber-Cola and number of Bars bars Vasya should buy in order to spend exactly n burles, i.e. x·a + y·b = n. If there are multiple answers print any of them.

Any of numbers x and y can be equal 0.

-----Note-----

In first example Vasya can buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and one Bars bar. He will spend exactly 2·2 + 1·3 = 7 burles.

In second example Vasya can spend exactly n burles multiple ways:   buy two bottles of Ber-Cola and five Bars bars;  buy four bottles of Ber-Cola and don't buy Bars bars;  don't buy Ber-Cola and buy 10 Bars bars. 

In third example it's impossible to but Ber-Cola and Bars bars in order to spend exactly n burles.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        y = (n - x * a) // b
        if x * a + y * b == n:
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
    print('NO')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The given program is correct because it iterates over all possible combinations of buying x bottles of Ber-Cola and calculates the corresponding number of Bars bars (y) that can be bought with the remaining money. If it finds a combination where the total cost equals n, it prints "YES" and the corresponding values of x and y. If no such combination is found after checking all possibilities, it prints "NO".

The program uses the fact that x cannot be greater than n // a, because buying more than n // a bottles of Ber-Cola would cost more than n. It also uses the fact that y must be an integer, which is why it uses the floor division operator (//) to calculate y.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including the cases where x or y is 0, and where n is not divisible by either a or b. It also correctly handles cases where there are multiple possible combinations of x and y that add up to n.

I couldn't find any example where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no explicit arguments, but it uses values obtained from standard input, where n (1 ≤ n ≤ 10 000 000) is the amount of money, a (1 ≤ a ≤ 10 000 000) is the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and b (1 ≤ b ≤ 10 000 000) is the cost of one Bars bar.
def func():
    n = int(input())
    a = int(input())
    b = int(input())
    for x in range(n // a + 1):
        y = (n - x * a) // b
        
        if x * a + y * b == n:
            print('YES')
            print(x, y)
            exit()
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer. If a combination of `x` and `y` is found such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, then `x` and `y` are the values that satisfy this equation, 'YES' has been printed along with the values of `x` and `y`, and the program has terminated. Otherwise, `x` is `n // a`, and `y` is `(n - (n // a) * a) // b`, indicating that no solution was found.
    print('NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads the amount of money `n`, the cost of one Ber-Cola bottle `a`, and the cost of one Bars bar `b` from standard input, and attempts to find a combination of Ber-Cola bottles (`x`) and Bars bars (`y`) such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`. If such a combination exists, it prints 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y`. If no combination is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to spend exactly `n` amount of money on the given items.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
