To calculate the output state, we consider the given initial state and the provided Python code snippet. 

The initial state is: 
- `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000,000
- `a` is a non-zero integer
- `b` is an integer
- `x` is 0

The code snippet is:
```python
y = (n - x * a) // b
```

Given that `x` is 0, the expression `x * a` equals 0, regardless of the value of `a`. Therefore, the expression simplifies to:
```python
y = (n - 0) // b
y = n // b
```

This means `y` is assigned the integer part of the division of `n` by `b`. The value of `y` depends on the values of `n` and `b`.

The states of `n`, `a`, `b`, and `x` are not changed by this operation. Only `y` is introduced or updated.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 0, `y` is the integer part of `n` divided by `b`.**
