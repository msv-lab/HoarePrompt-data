The function `func` accepts no explicit parameters but uses values obtained from standard input, including `n`, `a`, and `b`, where `n` represents the amount of money, `a` represents the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola, and `b` represents the cost of one Bars bar. All these values are integers within the range of 1 to 10,000,000. 

To determine the return value, we need the specific conditions or calculations based on `n`, `a`, and `b`. However, since the output conditions are not provided, we can generalize the functionality based on the input parameters. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept the amount of money `n`, the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola `a`, and the cost of one Bars bar `b` from standard input, and it returns a value based on these inputs, which could involve calculations related to purchasing decisions or affordability assessments.

Functionality: **The function accepts the amount of money `n`, the cost of one bottle of Ber-Cola `a`, and the cost of one Bars bar `b` from standard input and returns a value based on these inputs.**
