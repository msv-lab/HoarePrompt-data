The given Python code snippet only contains a print statement, which does not modify any variables. Therefore, the states of all variables remain unchanged. The code simply prints 'YES' to the console.


Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is 2, `y` is `(n - 2 * a) // b`, and 'YES' has been printed**
