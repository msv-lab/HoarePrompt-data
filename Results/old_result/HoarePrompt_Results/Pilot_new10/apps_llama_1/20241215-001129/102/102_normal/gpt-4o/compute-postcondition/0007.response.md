The code prints the values of `x` and `y`. The value of `x` is 0 and the value of `y` is `n // b`. Since `n` is a multiple of `b`, `y` is an integer. 'YES' has been printed before this step.

The states of the variables `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` do not change, and 'YES' has been printed. The value of `x` remains 0, the value of `y` remains `n // b`, and the relationship between `n` and `b` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer and a multiple of `b`, `a` is a positive input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000, `b` is an input integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000, `x` is 0, `y` is `n // b`, and 'YES' and the values 0 and `n // b` have been printed**
