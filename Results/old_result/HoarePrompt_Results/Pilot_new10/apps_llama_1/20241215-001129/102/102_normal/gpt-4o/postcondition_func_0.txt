The function reads three integers n, a, and b from the input, attempts to find integer values x and y such that n = a*x + b*y, and prints "YES" along with the values of x and y if such a combination exists; otherwise, it prints "NO". The function handles all positive integers n, a, and b but may behave unexpectedly with zero or negative inputs and does not enforce the specified upper limit of 10,000,000 for n, a, and b. After executing, the function returns None.
