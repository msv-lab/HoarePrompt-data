The provided Python code snippet simply prints 'NO', indicating that no combination of `x` and `y` was found such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`. 

The values of `n`, `a`, `b`, `x`, and `y` are not changed by the code. The states of these variables remain the same as in the initial state.

Since 'NO' has been printed, it means that the program did not terminate after finding a combination of `x` and `y` that satisfies the equation.

Given that no solution was found, `x` is still `n // a`, and `y` is `(n - (n // a) * a) // b`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10,000,000, `a` is a non-zero integer, `b` is an integer, `x` is `n // a`, `y` is `(n - (n // a) * a) // b`, and 'NO' has been printed.**
