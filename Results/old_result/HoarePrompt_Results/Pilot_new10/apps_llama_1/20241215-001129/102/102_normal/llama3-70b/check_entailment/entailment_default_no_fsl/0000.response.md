Correctness: **True**

The provided code appears to be correct and handles every potential case as described in the problem description. It iterates through all possible combinations of buying Ber-Cola bottles (`x`) and Bars bars (`y`) such that the total cost does not exceed `n`. For each combination, it checks if the total cost equals `n`. If such a combination is found, it immediately prints 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y` and exits the program. If no such combination is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO'.

The code covers all possible scenarios, including buying zero bottles of Ber-Cola or zero Bars bars. It also correctly handles cases where `n` is exactly divisible by `a` or `b`, as well as cases where it is not. 

The examples provided in the problem description, such as buying 2 bottles of Ber-Cola and 1 Bars bar to spend exactly 7 burles, are all correctly handled by the program. Additionally, the program correctly handles cases where it is impossible to spend exactly `n` burles, such as in the example where `n` is 15, `a` is 4, and `b` is 8.

The output hints also agree with the code's functionality, indicating that the program is working as expected. Since no case has been found where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is **True**.
