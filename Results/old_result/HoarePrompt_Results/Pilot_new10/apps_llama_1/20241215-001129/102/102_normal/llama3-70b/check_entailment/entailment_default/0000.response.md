Correctness: **True**

The code provided seems to be correct. It reads the amount of money `n`, the cost of one Ber-Cola bottle `a`, and the cost of one Bars bar `b` from standard input, and attempts to find a combination of Ber-Cola bottles (`x`) and Bars bars (`y`) such that `x * a + y * b` equals `n`. If such a combination exists, it prints 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y`. If no combination is found after checking all possibilities, it prints 'NO', indicating that it's not possible to spend exactly `n` amount of money on the given items.

The loop in the function iterates over all possible values of `x` from 0 to `n // a`, and for each `x`, it calculates the corresponding `y` as `(n - x * a) // b`. If `x * a + y * b` equals `n`, it means that the current combination of `x` and `y` satisfies the condition, and the function prints 'YES' along with the values of `x` and `y` and exits.

The code handles all possible cases, including the cases where `x` or `y` is 0. It also correctly handles cases where `n` is not exactly divisible by `a` or `b`, as well as cases where `a` or `b` is greater than `n`.

The provided examples also support the correctness of the code. For example, when `n = 7`, `a = 2`, and `b = 3`, the code correctly outputs `YES` with `x = 2` and `y = 1`, because `2 * 2 + 1 * 3 = 7`. Similarly, when `n = 100`, `a = 25`, and `b = 10`, the code correctly outputs `YES` with `x = 0` and `y = 10`, because `0 * 25 + 10 * 10 = 100`. And when `n = 15`, `a = 4`, and `b = 8`, the code correctly outputs `NO`, because there is no combination of `x` and `y` that satisfies the condition.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and works as expected for all possible cases.
