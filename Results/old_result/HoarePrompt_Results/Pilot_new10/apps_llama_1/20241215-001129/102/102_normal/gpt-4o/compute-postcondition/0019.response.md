The code snippet prints the values of `x` and `y`. The values of `x` and `y` are `2` and `(n - 2 * a) // b` respectively. 'YES' has been printed before this. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer at least `2 * a`, `a` is a positive integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000, `b` is an integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000, `x` is 2, `y` is `(n - 2 * a) // b`, 'YES' has been printed, and the values `2` and `(n - 2 * a) // b` have been printed.

Output State: **`n` is an integer at least `2 * a`, `a` is a positive integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000, `b` is an integer in the range 1 to 10,000,000, `x` is 2, `y` is `(n - 2 * a) // b`, 'YES' has been printed, and the values `2` and `(n - 2 * a) // b` have been printed**
