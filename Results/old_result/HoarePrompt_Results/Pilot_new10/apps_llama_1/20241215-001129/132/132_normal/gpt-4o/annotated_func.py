#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no explicit input parameters, but it is expected to read from an input file where the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers separated by spaces x_1, x_2,..., x_n (0 <= x_i <= 1000), and the third line contains n integers separated by spaces y_1, y_2,..., y_n (0 <= y_i <= 1000).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_x = sum(x)
    total_y = sum(y)
    if (total_y > total_x) :
        print('No')
    else :
        print('Yes')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of integers read from the input, `total_x` is the sum of the integers in `x`, `total_y` is the sum of the integers in `y`. If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, 'No' has been printed to the output. Otherwise, 'Yes' has been printed to the output.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a structured input file containing an integer n followed by two lines of n integers each, calculates the sum of the integers in each line, and prints 'Yes' if the sum of the second line is less than or equal to the sum of the first line; otherwise, it prints 'No', without handling any potential input errors or edge cases.
