Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code checks if the sum of the integers in the second line (total_y) is less than or equal to the sum of the integers in the first line (total_x). This is correct because the problem states that the jury members can either take one stone for themselves or move one stone from one pile to another. This means that the total number of stones cannot increase, only decrease or stay the same. Therefore, if the sum of the integers in the second line is greater than the sum of the integers in the first line, it is impossible for the jury members to have made that change, and the code correctly prints 'No'. 

In all other cases, where the sum of the integers in the second line is less than or equal to the sum of the integers in the first line, it is possible for the jury members to have made that change by either taking stones or moving them between piles, and the code correctly prints 'Yes'.

The provided examples also support this conclusion. For instance, in the first example, the total number of stones in the first line is 15 and in the second line is 15, so it is possible for the jury members to have made that change, and the code correctly prints 'Yes'. In the second example, the total number of stones in the first line is 5 and in the second line is 3, so it is possible for the jury members to have made that change by taking stones, and the code correctly prints 'Yes'. In the third example, the total number of stones in the first line is 14 and in the second line is 17, so it is impossible for the jury members to have made that change, and the code correctly prints 'No'. 

Therefore, the code is correct and works as expected for every potential case.
