The function reads a structured input file containing an integer n followed by two lines of n integers each, calculates the sum of the integers in each line, and prints 'Yes' if the sum of the second line is less than or equal to the sum of the first line; otherwise, it prints 'No', without handling any potential input errors or edge cases.
