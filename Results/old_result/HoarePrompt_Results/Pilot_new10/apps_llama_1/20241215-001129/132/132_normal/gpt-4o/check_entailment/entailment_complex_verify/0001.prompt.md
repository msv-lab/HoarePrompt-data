You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is a beautiful garden of stones in Innopolis.

Its most beautiful place is the $n$ piles with stones numbered from $1$ to $n$.

EJOI participants have visited this place twice. 

When they first visited it, the number of stones in piles was $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, correspondingly. One of the participants wrote down this sequence in a notebook. 

They visited it again the following day, and the number of stones in piles was equal to $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$. One of the participants also wrote it down in a notebook.

It is well known that every member of the EJOI jury during the night either sits in the room $108$ or comes to the place with stones. Each jury member who comes there either takes one stone for himself or moves one stone from one pile to another. We can assume that there is an unlimited number of jury members. No one except the jury goes to the place with stones at night.

Participants want to know whether their notes can be correct or they are sure to have made a mistake.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input file contains a single integer $n$, the number of piles with stones in the garden ($1 \leq n \leq 50$).

The second line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $x_1, x_2, \ldots, x_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the first time ($0 \leq x_i \leq 1000$).

The third line contains $n$ integers separated by spaces $y_1, y_2, \ldots, y_n$, the number of stones in piles recorded in the notebook when the participants came to the place with stones for the second time ($0 \leq y_i \leq 1000$).


-----Output-----

If the records can be consistent output "Yes", otherwise output "No" (quotes for clarity).


-----Examples-----
Input
5
1 2 3 4 5
2 1 4 3 5

Output
Yes

Input
5
1 1 1 1 1
1 0 1 0 1

Output
Yes

Input
3
2 3 9
1 7 9

Output
No



-----Note-----

In the first example, the following could have happened during the night: one of the jury members moved one stone from the second pile to the first pile, and the other jury member moved one stone from the fourth pile to the third pile.

In the second example, the jury took stones from the second and fourth piles.

It can be proved that it is impossible for the jury members to move and took stones to convert the first array into the second array.
Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_x = sum(x)
    total_y = sum(y)
    if total_y > total_x:
        print('No')
    else:
        print('Yes')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program works correctly because it accurately checks whether the total number of stones in the first and second observations can reconcile with the possible actions of the jury members. The key insight here is that the total number of stones can only decrease or remain the same, as jury members can either take stones or move them between piles. 

The program first calculates the total number of stones in each observation (`total_x` and `total_y`). If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, it means that the number of stones in the second observation is more than the number of stones in the first observation, which is impossible because jury members can only take stones or move them between piles, not add new stones. 

In all other cases, where `total_y` is less than or equal to `total_x`, it is possible for the jury members to transform the first array into the second array by either taking stones from some piles or moving stones between piles, which is why the program prints "Yes" in these cases. 

The provided examples in the problem description demonstrate the correctness of the program's logic. For instance, in the first example, one stone is moved from the second pile to the first pile, and another stone is moved from the fourth pile to the third pile, resulting in the second observation, which is correctly identified as possible by the program. Similarly, in the second example, stones are taken from the second and fourth piles, which is also correctly identified as possible by the program. 

Given the logic and the examples provided, the program appears to correctly implement the problem's requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, without being able to find a counterexample where the program does not work as expected, the correctness of the program is deemed to be True.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: The function takes no explicit input parameters, but it is expected to read from an input file where the first line contains a single integer n (1 <= n <= 50), the second line contains n integers separated by spaces x_1, x_2,..., x_n (0 <= x_i <= 1000), and the third line contains n integers separated by spaces y_1, y_2,..., y_n (0 <= y_i <= 1000).
def func():
    n = int(input())
    x = list(map(int, input().split()))
    y = list(map(int, input().split()))
    total_x = sum(x)
    total_y = sum(y)
    if (total_y > total_x) :
        print('No')
    else :
        print('Yes')
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers, `y` is a list of integers read from the input, `total_x` is the sum of the integers in `x`, `total_y` is the sum of the integers in `y`. If `total_y` is greater than `total_x`, 'No' has been printed to the output. Otherwise, 'Yes' has been printed to the output.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function reads a structured input file containing an integer n followed by two lines of n integers each, calculates the sum of the integers in each line, and prints 'Yes' if the sum of the second line is less than or equal to the sum of the first line; otherwise, it prints 'No', without handling any potential input errors or edge cases.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
