The code snippet `x = list(map(int, input().split()))` is used to read a line of input, split it into separate integers, and store them in a list called `x`.

Since the initial state specifies that there are `n` integers `x_1, x_2,..., x_n` that have not been read yet, the `input().split()` function will read these `n` integers.

The `map(int,...)` function will convert each of these integers from strings to integers.

The `list(...)` function will store these integers in a list called `x`.

Therefore, the list `x` will contain the `n` integers `x_1, x_2,..., x_n` that were read from the input.

The state of `n` is still an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), and the state of `y_1, y_2,..., y_n` is still that they have not been read yet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 50 (inclusive), `x` is a list of `n` integers `x_1, x_2,..., x_n` that were read from the input, and there are `n` integers `y_1, y_2,..., y_n` that have not been read yet.**
