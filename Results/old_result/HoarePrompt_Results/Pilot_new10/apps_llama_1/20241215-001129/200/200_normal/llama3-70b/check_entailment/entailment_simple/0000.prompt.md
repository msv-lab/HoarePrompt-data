You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: The Fair Nut likes kvass very much. On his birthday parents presented him $n$ kegs of kvass. There are $v_i$ liters of kvass in the $i$-th keg. Each keg has a lever. You can pour your glass by exactly $1$ liter pulling this lever. The Fair Nut likes this drink very much, so he wants to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass. But he wants to do it, so kvass level in the least keg is as much as possible.

Help him find out how much kvass can be in the least keg or define it's not possible to pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two integers $n$ and $s$ ($1 \le n \le 10^3$, $1 \le s \le 10^{12}$) — the number of kegs and glass volume.

The second line contains $n$ integers $v_1, v_2, \ldots, v_n$ ($1 \le v_i \le 10^9$) — the volume of $i$-th keg.


-----Output-----

If the Fair Nut cannot pour his glass by $s$ liters of kvass, print $-1$. Otherwise, print a single integer — how much kvass in the least keg can be.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3
4 3 5

Output
3

Input
3 4
5 3 4

Output
2

Input
3 7
1 2 3

Output
-1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the answer is $3$, the Fair Nut can take $1$ liter from the first keg and $2$ liters from the third keg. There are $3$ liters of kvass in each keg.

In the second example, the answer is $2$, the Fair Nut can take $3$ liters from the first keg and $1$ liter from the second keg.

In the third example, the Fair Nut can't pour his cup by $7$ liters, so the answer is $-1$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer, s is a positive integer, and there is a list of n integers v where each v_i is a positive integer and 1 <= n <= 10^3, 1 <= s <= 10^12, and 1 <= v_i <= 10^9.
def func():
    n, s = map(int, input().split())
    v = list(map(int, input().split()))
    v.sort()
    low, high = 0, min(v)
    while low < high:
        mid = (low + high + 1) // 2
        
        total = sum(min(mid, x) for x in v)
        
        if total < s:
            low = mid
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `low` and `high` have converged such that `low` is the minimum value where the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is greater than or equal to `s`, or the closest value to this condition without exceeding `s` if such an exact value does not exist, with `low` being equal to or one more than `high` at termination.
    if (sum(min(low, x) for x in v) != s) :
        print(-1)
    else :
        print(low)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n` is unchanged, `s` is unchanged, `v` is unchanged, `low` and `high` have converged such that `low` is the minimum value where the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is greater than or equal to `s`, or the closest value to this condition without exceeding `s` if such an exact value does not exist, with `low` being equal to or one more than `high` at termination. If the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is equal to `s`, then `low` has been returned and printed at the output. Otherwise, -1 has been printed because the sum of the minimum between `low` and each element in `v` is not equal to `s`.

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
