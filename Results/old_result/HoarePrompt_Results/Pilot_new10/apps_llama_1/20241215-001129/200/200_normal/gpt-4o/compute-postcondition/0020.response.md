The `continue` statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there are no changes made to the variables and `continue` does not affect variable values, it simply moves to the next iteration if we are in a loop.

Given that `n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 1, and considering the effect of `continue`, the execution simply moves to the next iteration without changing any variable values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 1, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 1, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
