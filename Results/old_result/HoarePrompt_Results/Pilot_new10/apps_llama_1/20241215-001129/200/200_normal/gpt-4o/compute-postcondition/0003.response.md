The code calculates the sum of all elements in the `volumes` list and assigns it to the variable `total_volume`. 

The value of `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in the `volumes` list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers such that 1 <= v_i <= 10^9 for each i, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, and `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`.**
