The function accepts parameters n and s, and a list v_i, calculates the total volume of all kegs, and if the total volume is less than s, prints -1; otherwise, it calculates the minimum keg volume that can be used to fill n kegs with a total volume of at least s, considering the case where there is remaining kvass after filling all kegs, and prints this minimum keg volume.
