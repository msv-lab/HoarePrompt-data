The code provided is a single statement, `break`. This statement will terminate the loop that it is currently inside. 

The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 0, `remaining_kvass` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer greater than 0, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is 0, `remaining_kvass` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop.**
