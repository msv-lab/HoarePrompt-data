Postcondition: **`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` is equal to the sum of all elements in `volumes`, `total_volume` is greater than or equal to the original value of `s`, `min_keg_volume` is equal to `volumes[0]`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, the current value of `remaining_kvass` is between 0 and the original value of `s` (inclusive), depending on how much kvass was distributed, and the current value of `remaining_kvass` is greater than 0**
