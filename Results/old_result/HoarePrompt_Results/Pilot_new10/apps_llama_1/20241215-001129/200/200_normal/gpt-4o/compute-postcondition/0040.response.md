The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `s` which are input from the user, and a list of `n` non-negative integers `v_i` also input from the user. 

Inside the function, it calculates the total volume of all kegs which is the sum of all elements in `v_i`. If the total volume is less than `s`, it prints -1. 

If the total volume is greater than or equal to `s`, it sorts the volumes in ascending order, and then calculates the remaining kvass `remaining_kvass` after filling the smallest keg. 

Then, it iterates through each keg from smallest to largest, filling each keg with the minimum of the difference between the current keg and the smallest keg, and the remaining kvass. 

After filling all kegs, if there is still remaining kvass, it reduces the minimum keg volume by the integer division of the remaining kvass plus `n-1` by `n`. 

Finally, it prints the minimum keg volume.

The functionality of the function is to calculate the minimum keg volume that can be used to fill `n` kegs with a total volume of at least `s`, or print -1 if it's impossible.

Functionality: ** The function accepts parameters n and s, and a list v_i, calculates the total volume of all kegs, and if the total volume is less than s, prints -1; otherwise, it calculates the minimum keg volume that can be used to fill n kegs with a total volume of at least s, considering the case where there is remaining kvass after filling all kegs, and prints this minimum keg volume. **
