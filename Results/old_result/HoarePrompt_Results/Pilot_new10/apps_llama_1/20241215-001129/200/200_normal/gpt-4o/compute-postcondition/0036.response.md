Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `s` is an input integer, `v_i` is a list of n non-negative integers, `volumes` is a sorted list of input integers in ascending order, `total_volume` equals the sum of all elements in `volumes` and is greater than or equal to `s`, `min_keg_volume` equals `volumes[0]` if `remaining_kvass` is 0, otherwise `min_keg_volume` equals `volumes[0] - (remaining_kvass + n - 1) // n`, `i` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0, and `remaining_kvass` is between 0 and the original value of `s` (inclusive).***
