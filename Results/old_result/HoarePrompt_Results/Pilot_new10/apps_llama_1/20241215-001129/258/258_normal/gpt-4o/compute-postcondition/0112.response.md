To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state:

Initial State:
- `meats` is a list of tuples
- `K` is a positive integer
- `T` is a non-negative real number
- `N` is at least 3
- `i` is 1
- `j` is 3
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`
- `d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`
- `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`
- `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`
- `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`
- `d2` is `((x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2)) / 4`
- If `d * d2` is less than or equal to `d2`, the program ends the current iteration, otherwise, it continues to the next iteration of the loop

Given Code:
```python
mx = cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2
```

This code introduces a new variable `mx` and calculates its value based on `cx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `d`. 

Let's break it down:
- `d2 * d - d * d` simplifies to `d2 * d - d^2`
- `math.sqrt(d2 * d - d^2)` calculates the square root of the difference between the product of `d2` and `d` and the square of `d`
- This result is then multiplied by `dy` and divided by `d2`
- Finally, `cx` is added to this result to get `mx`

Thus, the output state includes all the initial state variables and the new variable `mx`. The values of `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, and `d2` remain unchanged as they are not reassigned in the given code snippet. However, the condition regarding the program ending the current iteration or continuing based on `d * d2` and `d2` is not directly affected by the calculation of `mx` but is part of the context in which `mx` is calculated.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) * (x1 - x2) + (y1 - y2) * (y1 - y2)) / 4`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and if `d * d2` is less than or equal to `d2`, the program ends the current iteration, otherwise, it continues to the next iteration of the loop**
