To calculate the output state, we first need to understand the initial state and how the given code snippet affects it.

Given the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples.
- `K` is a positive integer.
- `T` is a non-negative real number.
- `N` is at least 4.
- `i` is 1.
- `j` is 4.
- The values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `mx` depend on the value of `d`, which is `T / meats[1][2] - T / meats[4][2]`.

The code given is:
```python
cx = (x1 + x2) / 2
```

This line of code updates the value of `cx` based on the values of `x1` and `x2`. 

To determine the new value of `cx`, we must consider the two cases for `d`:

1. If `d < 0`, then `x1` is `meats[4][0]`, `y1` is `meats[4][1]`, `c1` is `meats[4][2]`, `x2` is `meats[1][0]`, `y2` is `meats[1][1]`, `c2` is `meats[1][2]`. 
   - In this case, `cx = (meats[4][0] + meats[1][0]) / 2`.

2. If `d >= 0`, then `x1` remains `meats[1][0]`, `y1` remains `meats[1][1]`, `c1` remains `meats[1][2]`, `x2` remains `meats[4][0]`, `y2` remains `meats[4][1]`, `c2` remains `meats[4][2]`.
   - In this case, `cx = (meats[1][0] + meats[4][0]) / 2`.

Notably, both cases result in the same expression for `cx` because the order of addition does not change the result. Therefore, regardless of the value of `d`, `cx` is updated to `(meats[1][0] + meats[4][0]) / 2`.

Other variables such as `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `j`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `mx` retain their values as defined in the initial state, with the understanding that their specific values might depend on the conditions related to `d`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `cx` is `(meats[1][0] + meats[4][0]) / 2`, and the values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, and `mx` depend on the conditions related to `d` as initially stated.**
