The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. Since there's no loop provided in the code snippet, we'll assume it's part of a larger loop structure. However, given the provided initial state and the `continue` statement alone, no variables are directly modified by this statement. It affects the flow of the program by skipping to the next iteration of the loop, but without the loop structure or additional code, we cannot determine what changes occur due to this skip.

Given the initial state:
- `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat,
- `K` is a positive integer,
- `T` is a non-negative real number,
- `N` is greater than 3,
- The conditional assignment of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` based on the comparison `c1 * T < c2 * T`,
- `i` is 0,
- `j` is 3,
- `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T`

And considering the `continue` statement does not directly modify any variables but rather controls the flow, the output state remains the same as the initial state because no direct modifications are made to any variables by the `continue` statement itself.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are defined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T`, and we move to the next iteration of the loop.**
