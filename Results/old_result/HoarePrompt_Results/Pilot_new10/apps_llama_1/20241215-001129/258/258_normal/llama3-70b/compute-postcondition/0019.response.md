To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the variables.

The given code snippet is: `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])`

From the initial state, we know:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th elements of the previous `times` for all iterations
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`

The code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the K-1th element of `times`. 

Given that `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`, without knowing the specifics of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact values in `times`. However, we can say that `ans` will be updated to the minimum of its current value and the value at index `K-1` in `times`.

The values of `x`, `y`, and `K` are not changed by this operation. 

The output state, considering the update of `ans` and the unchanged values of `x`, `y`, `K`, and the definition of `times`, is:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the K-1th element of `times`
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`

Since `ans` is updated based on `times[K - 1]`, and without knowing the exact values in `times`, we can say `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum value and the value at `times[K - 1]`.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`**
