The code `times.sort()` sorts the list `times` in ascending order. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, `ans` is the minimum value between its previous minimum (if defined) and its previous `times[K - 1]`.**
