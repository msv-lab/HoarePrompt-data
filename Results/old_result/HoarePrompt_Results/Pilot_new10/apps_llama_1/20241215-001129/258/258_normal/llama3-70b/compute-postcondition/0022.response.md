The given code snippet is `times.sort()`. This line of code sorts the `times` list in ascending order. 

The initial state is: `x` is -999, `y` is -999, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]` where `times` is now the result of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`.

After executing the code, the `times` list is sorted in ascending order. The values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `ans`, and `N` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -999, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`**
