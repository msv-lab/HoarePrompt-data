To determine the output state, we first need to understand the impact of the given code on the program, considering the initial state provided.


Given the initial state:
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -999
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`


The code snippet provided is:
```python
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```
This means the value of `times` will be reassigned based on the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`.


Since `x` is -998 and `y` is -999, we substitute these values into the function call:
```python
times = func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)
```


Given that the original state of `times` was the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`, this new assignment changes the value of `times` to the result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`.


The values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `ans`, and `N` are not directly affected by this operation, as the code only reassigns the value of `times`.


Therefore, the output state, considering all provided information and the update to `times`, is:


Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, and `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`**
