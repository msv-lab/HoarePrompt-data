Postcondition: **`meats` is potentially modified, `K` retains its initial value, `T` retains its initial value, `N` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the 5th element of `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the 3rd element of `meats`, otherwise `x1`, `y1`, `c1` remain the values of the 3rd element of `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` remain the values of the 5th element of `meats`, `d` may be recalculated, `cy` may be recalculated, `dx` may be recalculated, `dy` may be recalculated, `d2` may be recalculated, `mx` may be recalculated, `my` may be recalculated, `count` may change**
