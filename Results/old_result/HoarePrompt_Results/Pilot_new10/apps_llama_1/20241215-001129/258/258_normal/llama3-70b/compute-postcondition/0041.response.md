To calculate the output state, let's consider the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -998
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`
- `ans` is the minimum value between its previous minimum (if defined) and its previous `times[K - 1]`

The code to execute is:
```python
ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```

This line of code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `times[K - 1]`.

Since `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, without knowing the exact implementation of `func_2`, we can't determine the exact values in `times`. However, we know `times` is sorted.

Given that `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times[K - 1]` refers to an element in the sorted `times` list. The exact value of `times[K - 1]` depends on the sorting of `times` and the value of `K`.

The initial value of `ans` is the minimum between its previous minimum (if defined) and its previous `times[K - 1]`. After the code execution, `ans` will be updated to the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.

Thus, the output state considering the update of `ans` and without any change in other variables is:
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -998
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`
- `ans` is the minimum value between its previous minimum (if defined) and `times[K - 1]`, now updated to be at least as small as `times[K - 1]`.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.**
