The value of `x` is updated to `int(data[index])`. The previous value of `x` was `int(data[index-3])`, but this change does not affect the other variables. The state of `N`, `K`, `meats`, `data`, `index`, `y`, and `c` remains the same.

Output State: **`N` is at least 3, `K` remains as `int(data[1])`, `meats` is updated to include another tuple based on the next elements in `data`, `data` remains the same, `index` is incremented to at least 15, `x` is `int(data[index])`, `y` is `int(data[index-2])`, and `c` is `int(data[index-1])`**
