The code `my = cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2` updates the value of `my`. The previous values of the variables are used to calculate the new value of `my`. 

Given that `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, and `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, we can substitute these expressions into the equation for `my`.

The value of `my` becomes `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, which is `((y1 + y2) / 2) - ((x1 - x2) / 2) * math.sqrt(((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)) * ((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)) - ((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)) * ((c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2))) / (((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2))`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: 
`meats` is potentially modified, 
`K` and `T` retain their initial values, 
`N` is greater than 2, 
`i` is 2, 
`j` is 3, 
`x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the old values of the 4th element of `meats`, 
`x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the old values of the 3rd element of `meats`, 
`d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, 
`cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, 
`dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, 
`dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, 
`d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, 
`mx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2 + (y1 - y2) / 2 * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, 
`my` is `(y1 + y2) / 2 - (x1 - x2) / 2 * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, 
`count` holds a value based on the previous iteration of the loop or remains unchanged, 
`cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, 
and if the product of `d` and `d2` is greater than `d2`, we move on to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise the execution ends without further modifications.
