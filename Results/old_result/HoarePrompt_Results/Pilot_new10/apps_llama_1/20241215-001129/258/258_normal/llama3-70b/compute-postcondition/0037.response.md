To calculate the output state, let's break down the initial state and the given code.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -999
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N` (note that `N` is not defined in the initial state, so we'll keep this condition as is)
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`

The code snippet is:
```
ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```
This line of code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `times[K - 1]`.

Given the initial state, `ans` initially is the minimum of its previous value (which is not explicitly defined, so we consider it as is) and `times[K - 1]`. The code then updates `ans` to this minimum value, effectively not changing the definition of `ans` from the initial state but updating its value based on the comparison.

The output state is therefore:
- `x` remains -998
- `y` remains -999
- `K` remains an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `times` remains the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its initial value and `times[K - 1]`, but since its initial definition was already the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `ans` is still the minimum of its "previous" value (now considered as the value before this update, which was already the minimum) and `times[K - 1]`. Essentially, `ans` remains the minimum value it could be based on `times[K - 1]` and any previous value it might have had.

Therefore, the specific update to `ans` is that it now holds the value of the minimum between its previous minimum value (if any was explicitly given before this statement) and `times[K - 1]`, but since we're not provided with an explicit initial value for `ans` before this comparison, we acknowledge that `ans` now or continues to hold the minimum value it can be, based on `times[K - 1]`.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -999, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -999, -998, -999)`, `ans` is the minimum value between its previous minimum (if defined) and `times[K - 1]`.**
