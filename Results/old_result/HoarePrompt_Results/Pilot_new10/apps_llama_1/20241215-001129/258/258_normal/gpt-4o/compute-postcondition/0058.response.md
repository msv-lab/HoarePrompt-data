The provided Python code calculates the average of `y1` and `y2` and assigns it to the variable `cy`. 

Given the initial conditions: 
- `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat
- `K` is a positive integer
- `T` is a non-negative real number
- `N` is greater than 3
- `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are defined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`
- `i` is 0
- `j` is 3
- `d` is `d` divided by `c1 * c2`
- `(c1 - c2) * T` is not less than 0
- `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`

The code `cy = (y1 + y2) / 2` introduces a new variable `cy` which is the average of `y1` and `y2`. 

Since none of the other variables are modified by the code, their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are defined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `d` divided by `c1 * c2`, `(c1 - c2) * T` is not less than 0, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, and `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`**
