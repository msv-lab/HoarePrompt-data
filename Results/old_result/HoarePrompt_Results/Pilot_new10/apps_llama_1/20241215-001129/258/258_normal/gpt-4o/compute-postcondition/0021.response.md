The code `meats.append((x, y, c))` adds a tuple containing the values of `x`, `y`, and `c` to the `meats` list. 

Since `x` is `int(data[index])`, `y` is `int(data[index + 1])`, and `c` is `int(data[index + 2])`, the tuple `(x, y, c)` is equivalent to `(int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2]))`.

Given the initial state, `N` is at least 3, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is updated, `data` remains the same, `index` is at least 15, `x` is `int(data[index])`, `y` is `int(data[index + 1])`, and `c` is `int(data[index + 2])`.

After executing the code, `meats` will include the additional tuple `(x, y, c)`, which is `(int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2]))`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is at least 3, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` includes the tuple `(int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2]))` in addition to its previous values, `data` remains the same, `index` is at least 15, `x` is `int(data[index])`, `y` is `int(data[index + 1])`, and `c` is `int(data[index + 2])`.**
