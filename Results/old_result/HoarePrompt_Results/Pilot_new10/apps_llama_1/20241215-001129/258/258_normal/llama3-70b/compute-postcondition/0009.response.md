To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

`ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])`

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -999
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the K-1th element of the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`

The code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `times[K - 1]`.

Since the exact output of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `ans` and `times`. However, we can express the update in terms of the given information.

- `x` remains -1000.
- `y` remains -999.
- `K` remains an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`.
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its original value (the K-1th element of `times`) and the K-1th element of `times`. Essentially, `ans` is set to the K-1th element of `times` because it is already defined as such, but now it's explicitly the minimum of itself and itself, which doesn't change its value based on the given definition.
- `times` remains the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`.

Given the nature of the update, `ans` will be the K-1th element of the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`, which is its initial definition. Thus, the update doesn't change `ans` from its initial state based on the information provided, but for clarity and adherence to instructions:

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the K-1th element of `times`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`**
