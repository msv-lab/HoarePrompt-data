Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

One potential issue is that the code does not handle the case when the minimum number of pieces to be eaten, K, is equal to the total number of pieces, N. In this case, the binary search performed in `func_2` should start with a lower bound of 0, but the code initializes `low` to 0 and `high` to a very large number. This could lead to an incorrect result if all pieces are ready at the same time.

Another issue is that `func_1` does not check for the case when the distance between two pieces of meat is 0. In this case, the calculation of `d` would result in a division by zero.

Moreover, the annotations suggest that `func_1` modifies the input list `meats` by swapping elements based on their hardness relative to time. However, this modification is not necessary and can lead to incorrect results if the function is called multiple times with the same input.

Additionally, the problem description states that the coordinates of the pieces of meat are real numbers, but the code reads them as integers. This could lead to incorrect results if the coordinates are not integers.

Finally, the problem description does not specify what to do in case of a tie, i.e., when two or more heat sources result in the same minimum time. The code does not handle this case explicitly, which could lead to incorrect results.

Overall, while the code is close to a correct implementation, it does not handle all edge cases and potential issues, and therefore its correctness cannot be guaranteed.
