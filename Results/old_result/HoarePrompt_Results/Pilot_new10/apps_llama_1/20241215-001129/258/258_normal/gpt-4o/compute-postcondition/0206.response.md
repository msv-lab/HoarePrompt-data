Postcondition: **`meats` is potentially modified, `K` retains its initial value, `T` retains its initial value, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, `cx` is `(meats[3] + meats[5]) / 2`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the 5th or 3rd element of `meats` based on the comparison, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the 3rd or 5th element of `meats` based on the comparison, `d` is `(c1 * T - c2 * T) / (c1 * c2)`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2)^2 + ((y1 - y2) / 2)^2`, `mx` is `cx + dy * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, `my` is `cy - dx * math.sqrt(d2 * d - d * d) / d2`, and if `count` is greater than or equal to `K`, the program returns True; otherwise, no action is taken.**
