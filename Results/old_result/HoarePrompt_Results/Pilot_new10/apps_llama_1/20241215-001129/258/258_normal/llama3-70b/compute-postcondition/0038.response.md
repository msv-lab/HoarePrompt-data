According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -999. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1, so `y` is -998, but since the loop is executed again `y` is actually increased from -999 to -998 for the last iteration, now `y` should be increased to -998 + 1 = -997 for the next iteration. `x` is not related to the loop condition. `K` is not related to the loop condition. `times` and `ans` are not related to the loop condition.
State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -997, -998, -997)`, `ans` is the minimum value between its previous minimum (if defined) and `times[K - 1]`**
