To determine the output state, we need to analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: 
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -998
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`
- `ans` is the K-1th element of the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`

The code is:
```
ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```

This line of code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of `times[K - 1]`.

Given that `ans` is initially the K-1th element of the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)` and `times` is also the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, `ans` is essentially an element of `times`. When `K` equals 1, `ans` is compared with the first element of `times` (since indexing starts at 0). For any `K`, `ans` will be updated to be the smaller value between its current value and the K-1th element of `times`.

However, without the exact definition of `func_2` and the value of `N`, we cannot determine the exact values of `times` and `ans`. But we can infer that:

- `x` remains -1000
- `y` remains -998
- `K` remains the same integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `times` remains the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`
- `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its initial value (the K-1th element of `times`) and the K-1th element of `times`

Thus, `ans` is essentially the minimum of two elements from the sorted list `times`, which implies it will be either the same as before or a smaller value, depending on the value of `times[K - 1]`.

The output state, therefore, updates the value of `ans` but keeps all other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -998, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -998, -1000, -998)`, `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th element of `times` and the K-1th element of `times`.**
