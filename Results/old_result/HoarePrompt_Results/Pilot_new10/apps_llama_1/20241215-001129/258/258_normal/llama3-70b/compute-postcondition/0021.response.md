To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state provides the following information:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -999
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`

The code snippet is:
```python
times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
```
Given that `x` is -999 and `y` is -999, we substitute these values into the function call:
```python
times = func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)
```
The function `func_2` is called with all arguments being -999. The initial state also mentions that `times` was initially the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`, but this information is overridden by the new assignment.

Since the specific implementation of `func_2` is not provided, we cannot determine the exact output of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`. However, we can conclude that the value of `times` will be the result of this function call.

The states of `x`, `y`, `K`, `ans`, and `N` are not directly affected by this assignment, as it only reassigns the value of `times`.

Therefore, the output state, considering the information provided and the changes made by the code, is:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -999
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, but since `times` has been updated, this relationship now refers to the new `times` value
- `times` is the result of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -999, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]` where `times` is now the result of `func_2(-999, -999, -999, -999)`**
