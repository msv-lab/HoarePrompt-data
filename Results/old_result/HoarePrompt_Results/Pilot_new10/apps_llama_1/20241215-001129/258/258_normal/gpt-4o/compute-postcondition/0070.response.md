According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `N`. If `i` is less than `N`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `N` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be increased by 1, so `i` is 1, and for the loop to execute again, `N` must be greater than 1.
State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1**
