According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `y`. If `y` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `y` is -1000. For the loop to execute again, `y` must be increased by 1. 
State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -999, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -1000, -999, -1000)`**
