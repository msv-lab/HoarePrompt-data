The code appends a tuple containing the values of `x`, `y`, and `c` to the `meats` list. The previous values of the variables are: `N` is `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is an empty list `[]`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, `index` is 2, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `y` is `int(data[3])`, and `c` is `int(data[4])`.

After executing the code, the `meats` list is updated to contain a tuple `(x, y, c)` which is equal to `(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is `int(data[0])` and must be greater than 0, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is `[(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))]`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, `index` is 2, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `y` is `int(data[3])`, and `c` is `int(data[4])`.**
