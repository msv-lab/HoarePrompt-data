To summarize the functionality of the given function `func_1`, let's analyze it step by step.

1. **Parameters Acceptance**: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters:
   - `meats`: A list of tuples, where each tuple contains three integers representing the coordinates (`x`, `y`) and hardness (`c`) of a piece of meat.
   - `K`: A positive integer representing the minimum number of pieces of meat to be ready.
   - `T`: A non-negative real number representing the time within which the pieces of meat should be ready.

2. **Return Value**: The function returns a boolean value indicating whether a certain condition related to the meat pieces has been met.

3. **Functionality Summary**:
   - The function iterates through each pair of meat pieces in the list `meats`. For each pair, it checks if the product of the hardness of the first piece and time `T` is less than the product of the hardness of the second piece and time `T`. If so, it swaps the two pieces.
   - It then calculates a mid-point (`mx`, `my`) between the two pieces and a distance `d2` between them. If `d2` multiplied by `d` (difference in hardness scaled by time) is greater than `d` squared, it skips to the next pair.
   - Otherwise, it calculates another point (`mx`, `my`) based on the previous calculations and counts the number of pieces of meat that are within the distance `T` from this point, considering their hardness.
   - If at any point the count of pieces of meat that meet the condition is greater than or equal to `K`, the function returns `True`, indicating the condition has been met.
   - If the function iterates through all pairs of meat pieces without finding a condition that meets the requirement, it returns `False`.

4. **Edge Cases and Missing Logic**:
   - The function does not handle the case where `meats` is an empty list. In such a case, `N` would be 0, and the loops would not execute, leading to an immediate return of `False` without any calculations. This might be considered an edge case.
   - The function modifies the original list `meats` by swapping elements based on their hardness and time. This could be considered a side effect, and the impact of this modification on the subsequent calculations should be understood.
   - The function does not explicitly handle the case where `K` is 0 or negative, although the specification describes `K` as a positive integer. In the current implementation, if `K` is 0, the function would likely return `True` immediately because any number of pieces would be greater than or equal to 0.
   - The mathematical calculations and the condition for counting pieces of meat rely on the formula `c * math.sqrt((mx - x)^2 + (my - y)^2) <= T`. This formula calculates the time it would take for each piece of meat to reach a certain point, considering its hardness. The condition is met if this time is less than or equal to `T`.

Given the analysis above, the functionality of `func_1` can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of meat pieces with their coordinates and hardness, a minimum number of pieces to be ready, and a time within which the pieces should be ready. It calculates and checks conditions based on the meat pieces' hardness and distance to certain calculated points, returning True if the condition where the count of pieces meeting a specific distance and time criteria is greater than or equal to the minimum required is met, and False otherwise. The function modifies the input list by swapping elements based on their hardness relative to time, does not handle edge cases like an empty input list explicitly, and implicitly assumes positive K and non-negative T for its logic to apply as described. **
