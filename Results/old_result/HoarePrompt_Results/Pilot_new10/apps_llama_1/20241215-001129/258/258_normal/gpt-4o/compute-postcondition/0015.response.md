The code `meats.append((x, y, c))` appends a new tuple to the `meats` list. The tuple contains the values of `x`, `y`, and `c`, which are `int(data[index])`, `int(data[index + 1])`, and `int(data[index + 2])` respectively.

Given the initial state:
- `N` is greater than 1
- `K` is `int(data[1])`
- `meats` is `[(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4]))]`
- `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces
- `index` is at least 9
- `x` is `int(data[index])`
- `y` is `int(data[index + 1])`
- `c` is `int(data[index + 2])`

The new value of `meats` will be `[(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4])), (int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2]))]`.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is greater than 1, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is `[(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4])), (int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2]))]`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, `index` is at least 9, `x` is `int(data[index])`, `y` is `int(data[index + 1])`, and `c` is `int(data[index + 2])`.

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is `[(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4])), (int(data[index]), int(data[index + 1]), int(data[index + 2]))]`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, `index` is at least 9, `x` is `int(data[index])`, `y` is `int(data[index + 1])`, and `c` is `int(data[index + 2])**
