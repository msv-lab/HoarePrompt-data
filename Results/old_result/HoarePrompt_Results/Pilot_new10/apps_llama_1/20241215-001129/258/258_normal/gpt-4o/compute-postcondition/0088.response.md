The `continue` statement skips the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. In this case, since there are no loops provided in the given code snippet, the effect of `continue` is essentially a no-operation as it cannot skip any iterations without a surrounding loop.

Therefore, considering the initial state and the given code, the values of all variables remain unchanged because `continue` does not modify any variables or conditions when used outside of a loop. The initial conditions provided still hold true.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are values from the second tuple in `meats`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are values from the third tuple in `meats`, `d` is `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)` and `d` is greater than or equal to 0, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)`, and the product of `d` and `d2` is greater than `d2`**
