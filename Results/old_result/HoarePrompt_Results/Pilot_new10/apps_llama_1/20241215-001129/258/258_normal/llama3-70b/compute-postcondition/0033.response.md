To determine the impact of the code on the program, we first need to understand what the code does. The line `ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])` updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum between its current value and the value of `times[K - 1]`.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th elements of all `times` calculated for each `y` in the range
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`

The code affects the variable `ans`. The new value of `ans` will be the minimum between its current value (which is the minimum of the K-1th elements of all `times` calculated for each `y` in the range) and the K-1th element of `times`.

Since `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`, without knowing the specifics of `func_2`, we cannot determine the exact values in `times`. However, we know `ans` is updated to be the minimum of its current value and a specific element from `times`, which means `ans` will either remain the same (if its current value is less than or equal to `times[K - 1]`) or decrease (if `times[K - 1]` is less than the current value of `ans`).

Therefore, the output state is:
- `x` is -998
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -1000, -998, -1000)`**
