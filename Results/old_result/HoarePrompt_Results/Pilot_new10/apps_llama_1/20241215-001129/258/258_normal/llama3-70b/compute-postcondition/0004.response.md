The code snippet provided is `times.sort()`. This line of code sorts the elements of the `times` list in ascending order.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -1000
- `y` is -1000
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is positive infinity
- `times` is equal to `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`

The sorting operation only affects the `times` variable. Since `times` is a result of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`, after sorting, `times` will be a sorted list of values returned by `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`.

Other variables (`x`, `y`, `K`, `ans`, and `N`) remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the `times.sort()` operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
**`x` is -1000, `y` is -1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is positive infinity, and `times` is a sorted list equal to the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -1000, -1000, -1000)`.**
