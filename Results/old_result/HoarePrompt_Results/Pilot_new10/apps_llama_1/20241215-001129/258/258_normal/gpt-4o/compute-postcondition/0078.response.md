Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` must be at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 2. The current values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are determined by the condition that if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the third tuple in `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the second tuple in `meats`, otherwise `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the second tuple in `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the third tuple in `meats`. `d` is `(c1 - c2) * T`, and the current value of `d` is less than 0.**
