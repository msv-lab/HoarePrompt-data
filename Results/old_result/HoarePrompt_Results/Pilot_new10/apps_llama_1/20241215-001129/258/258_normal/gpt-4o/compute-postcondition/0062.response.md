The provided code snippet is `continue`. This statement is used to skip the rest of the code inside a loop for the current iteration only. 

Since `continue` does not change the values of any variables but only controls the flow of the program, the values of all variables remain the same as in the initial state. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are defined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `d` divided by `c1 * c2`, `(c1 - c2) * T` is not less than 0, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are defined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `d` divided by `c1 * c2`, `(c1 - c2) * T` is not less than 0, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, and `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2)`, and we continue to the next iteration of the loop.**
