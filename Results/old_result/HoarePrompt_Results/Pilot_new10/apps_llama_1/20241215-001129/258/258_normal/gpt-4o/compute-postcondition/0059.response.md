The code `dx = (x1 - x2) / 2` assigns the value `(x1 - x2) / 2` to the variable `dx`. The values of `meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `i`, `j`, `d`, `cx`, and `cy` are not affected by this code. 

The variable `cx` is still `(x1 + x2) / 2` and `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`. The condition `c1 * T < c2 * T` still applies to `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2`. Also, `(c1 - c2) * T` is not less than 0. The value of `d` is still `d` divided by `c1 * c2`.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are defined based on the condition `c1 * T < c2 * T`, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `d` is `d` divided by `c1 * c2`, `(c1 - c2) * T` is not less than 0, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, and `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`**
