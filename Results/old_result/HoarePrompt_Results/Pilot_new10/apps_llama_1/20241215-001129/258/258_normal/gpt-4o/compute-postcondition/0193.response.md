Postcondition: ***`meats` is potentially modified, `K` retains its initial value, `T` retains its initial value, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5, if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the 5th element of `meats`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the 3rd element of `meats`. Otherwise, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` remain the values of the 3rd element of `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` remain the values of the 5th element of `meats`, and `d` is `c1 * T - c2 * T`. If `d` is less than 0, we move to the next iteration of the loop.***
