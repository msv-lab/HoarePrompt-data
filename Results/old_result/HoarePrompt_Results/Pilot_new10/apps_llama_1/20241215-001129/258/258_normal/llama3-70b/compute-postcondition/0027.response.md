To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

Given the initial state:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -998
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous value and the `(K-1)`th smallest element in the sorted `times`
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`

The code to execute is:
```python
ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
```

This line of code updates the value of `ans` to be the minimum of its current value and the value of the `(K-1)`th element in the `times` list.

Since the specific values of `N` and the result of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)` are not provided, we cannot calculate the exact value of `times` or `ans`. However, we can express the outcome in terms of the given variables and functions.

The value of `ans` after execution will be the minimum of its previous value and the `(K-1)`th smallest element in `times`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `K` are not changed by this operation. The `times` variable's value is also not changed by this operation, as it is only read from, not written to.

Therefore, the output state, considering the information provided and the nature of the code executed, is:
- `x` is -999
- `y` is -998
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`
- `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum value and the `(K-1)`th smallest element in the sorted `times`
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`

Output State: **`x` is -999, `y` is -998, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of its previous minimum value and `times[K-1]`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-999, -998, -999, -998)`**
