According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `x`. If `x` is less than 1000, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is -1000. For the loop to execute again, `x` must be increased by 1. 
State: **`x` is -999, `y` is 1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the minimum of the K-1th elements of `times` for all iterations, and `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, 1000, -1000, 1000)`**
