The function `func_3` accepts input from the user, where the first two integers represent the number of pieces of meat `N` and the number of pieces to be eaten `K`, respectively, followed by `3N` integers representing the x and y coordinates and hardness of each piece of meat. 

However, the code does not check if `K` exceeds `N` or if the input values are within the given constraints. 

It then calls a function `func_2` with these parameters and prints the result with six decimal places.

The code does not handle potential edge cases such as non-integer inputs, negative integers, or cases where `N` or `K` is not a positive integer.

The functionality of the function is to read input from the user, parse it into `N`, `K`, and a list of meat pieces, call `func_2` with these parameters, and print the result.

Functionality: ** The function reads input from the user, parses it into the number of pieces of meat `N`, the number of pieces to be eaten `K`, and a list of meat pieces, calls `func_2` with these parameters, and prints the result with six decimal places, without validating if `K` exceeds `N` or if the input values are within the given constraints **
