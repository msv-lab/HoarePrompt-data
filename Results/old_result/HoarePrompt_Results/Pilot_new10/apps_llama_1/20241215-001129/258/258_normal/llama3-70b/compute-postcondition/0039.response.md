The code provided is `times = func_2(x, y, x, y)`. We are given the initial state where `x` is -998, `y` is -998, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, -997, -998, -997)`, and `ans` is the minimum value between its previous minimum (if defined) and `times[K - 1]`. 

When we execute the given code, the value of `times` will be updated to the result of `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, where `x` is -998 and `y` is -998. 

Therefore, the `times` will be the result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`. 

The states of the other variables `x`, `y`, `K`, `N`, and `ans` are not affected by this code execution.

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is -998, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the result of `func_2(-998, -998, -998, -998)`, `ans` is the minimum value between its previous minimum (if defined) and its previous `times[K - 1]`.**
