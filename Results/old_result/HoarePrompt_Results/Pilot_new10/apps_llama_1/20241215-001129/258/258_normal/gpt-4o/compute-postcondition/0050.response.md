The given Python code snippet is:
```
x2, y2, c2 = meats[j]
```
Given that `j` is 3, this line of code assigns the values of `meats[3]` to `x2`, `y2`, and `c2`. 

Since `x1`, `y1`, `c1` were initially equal to `x2`, `y2`, `c2` which are the values of `meats[0]`, after executing this line of code, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` will be equal to the values of `meats[3]`. 

Now, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are not necessarily equal to `x2`, `y2`, `c2` because `x2`, `y2`, `c2` have been updated to `meats[3]`.

The states of the other variables (`meats`, `K`, `T`, `N`, `i`, `cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`) are not affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples with at least 1 piece of meat, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is greater than 3, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` equal the values of `meats[0]`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` equal the values of `meats[3]`, and other variables (`cx`, `cy`, `dx`, `dy`, `d2`, `mx`, `my`) remain as initially defined based on `meats[3]`.**
