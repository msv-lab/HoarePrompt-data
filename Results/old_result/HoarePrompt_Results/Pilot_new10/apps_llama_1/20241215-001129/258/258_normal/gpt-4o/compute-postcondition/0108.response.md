The code calculates the value of `dy` as the difference between `y1` and `y2` divided by 2. The previous values of the variables are not changed, except for the new variable `dy` that is added to the state.

Output State: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is at least 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are based on the comparison of `c1 * T` and `c2 * T`, `d` is `T / c2 - T / c1`, `cx` is `(x1 + x2) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, and `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`**
