#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integer coordinates of a piece of meat, and X and Y are real numbers representing the coordinates of the heat source.
def func_1(x, y, X, Y):
    return math.sqrt((X - x) ** 2 + (Y - y) ** 2)
    #The program returns a real number representing the Euclidean distance between the integer coordinates of the piece of meat and the real number coordinates of the heat source.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function calculates and returns the Euclidean distance between two points, one defined by integer coordinates and the other by real number coordinates, using the Euclidean distance formula, for all valid numeric inputs.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are lists of integers representing the x and y coordinates of the pieces of meat, X and Y are real numbers representing the x and y coordinates of the heat source, and meats is a list of tuples where each tuple contains the x and y coordinates and the hardness of a piece of meat.
def func_2(x, y, X, Y):
    return [(c * func_1(x, y, X, Y)) for x, y, c in meats]
    #The program returns a list of values, where each value is the product of the hardness of a piece of meat and the result of func_1 for that piece of meat's coordinates relative to the heat source's coordinates.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts lists of x and y coordinates and the coordinates of a heat source, calculates the product of the hardness of each piece of meat and its relative position to the heat source as determined by another function `func_1`, and returns these products as a list, but its exact behavior depends on the definition of `func_1` and the external list `meats`.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that -1000 <= x, y <= 1000, and K is an integer such that 1 <= K <= N, where N is the total number of pieces of meat and is given elsewhere in the program.
def func_3():
    ans = float('inf')
    for x in range(-1000, 1001):
        for y in range(-1000, 1001):
            times = func_2(x, y, x, y)
            times.sort()
            ans = min(ans, times[K - 1])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `x` is 1000, `y` is 1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, and `ans` is the minimum of the `K-1`th elements of `times` for all possible pairs of `x` and `y` in the range -1000 to 1000.
    return ans
    #The program returns the minimum of the K-1th elements of 'times' for all possible pairs of 'x' and 'y' in the range -1000 to 1000, where 'x' is 1000 and 'y' is 1000.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function iterates over all integer pairs (x, y) in the range -1000 to 1000, applies an unspecified calculation func_2 to each pair, sorts the results, and then returns the minimum of the K-1th elements of these sorted results, where K's value and its relation to the unspecified total number of pieces of meat (N) are left undefined.
