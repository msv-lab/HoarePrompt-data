Postcondition: **`meats` is potentially modified, `K` retains its initial value, `T` retains its initial value, `N` is greater than 5, `i` is 2, `j` is 5. If `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, then `x1`, `y1`, `c1` are the values of the 5th element of `meats`, and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` are the values of the 3rd element of `meats`. Otherwise, `x1`, `y1`, `c1` remain the values of the 3rd element of `meats` and `x2`, `y2`, `c2` remain the values of the 5th element of `meats`. In both cases, `d` is calculated as `((c1 - c2) * T) / (c1 * c2)` if `c1 * T` is not less than `c2 * T`, or `((c2 - c1) * T) / (c2 * c1)` if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`. Additionally, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2` if `c1 * T` is not less than `c2 * T`, or `(x2 - x1) / 2` if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2` if `c1 * T` is not less than `c2 * T`, or `(y2 - y1) / 2` if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`, and `d2` is `((x1 - x2) / 2) * ((x1 - x2) / 2) + ((y1 - y2) / 2) * ((y1 - y2) / 2)` if `c1 * T` is not less than `c2 * T`, or `((x2 - x1) / 2) * ((x2 - x1) / 2) + ((y2 - y1) / 2) * ((y2 - y1) / 2)` if `c1 * T` is less than `c2 * T`. Then, `mx` and `my` are recalculated based on the new `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2` with the condition regarding the sum of `c` for all `(x, y, c)` in `meats` remaining as specified.**
