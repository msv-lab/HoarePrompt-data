Postcondition: **`meats` is a list of tuples, `K` is a positive integer, `T` is a non-negative real number, `N` is at least 4, `i` is 1, `j` is 4, `cx` is `(meats[1][0] + meats[4][0]) / 2`, `cy` is `(y1 + y2) / 2`, `dx` is `(x1 - x2) / 2`, `dy` is `(y1 - y2) / 2`, `d2` is `((x1 - x2)^2 + (y1 - y2)^2) / 4`, and the conditional values of `x1`, `y1`, `c1`, `x2`, `y2`, `c2`, `d`, and `mx` remain dependent on conditions related to `d`; if `d * d2` is greater than `d2`, the program continues to the next iteration of the loop, otherwise, the program ends the if-else block without any changes.**
