The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The initial value of `index` is at least 9, so the new value of `index` is at least 12. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`N` is greater than 1, `K` is `int(data[1])`, `meats` is `[(int(data[2]), int(data[3]), int(data[4])), (int(data[index-3]), int(data[index-2]), int(data[index-1]))]`, `data` is a list of input strings split by spaces, `index` is at least 12, `x` is `int(data[index-3])`, `y` is `int(data[index-2])`, and `c` is `int(data[index-1])`**
