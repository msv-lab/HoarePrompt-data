To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, let's analyze the loop code and the provided output states for the first few iterations.

The loop iterates over all possible values of `y` in the range `-1000` to `1000` (inclusive), calculates `times` using `func_2(x, y, x, y)`, sorts `times`, and updates `ans` with the minimum value between its current value and `times[K - 1]`.

From the output states after the loop executes 1, 2, and 3 times, we can observe the following patterns:

- `x` remains constant at `-998`.
- `y` takes on the current value from the range `-1000` to `1000` during each iteration.
- `K` remains an integer such that `1 <= K <= N`, where `N` is not explicitly defined in the given problem but seems to be related to the length of `times`.
- `times` is recalculated during each iteration based on the current `x` and `y` values.
- `ans` is updated during each iteration to be the minimum of its previous value and `times[K - 1]`.

Given this information, after all iterations of the loop have finished:

- `x` will still be `-998` because it does not change within the loop.
- `y` will have taken on all values from `-1000` to `1000`, but after the loop finishes, `y` will be `1000` because that is the last value it iterates over in the given range.
- `K` remains unchanged as it is not modified within the loop.
- `times` will be the sorted result of `func_2(-998, 1000, -998, 1000)` because that is the last calculation performed in the loop.
- `ans` will be the minimum of the `K-1`th elements of all `times` calculated for each `y` in the range. This means `ans` will hold the minimum value found across all iterations for the specified `K` value.

Considering the loop iterates over all possible `y` values and updates `ans` accordingly, and given that `x` and `K` do not change, the output state after all iterations can be described as follows:

Output State: **`x` is -998, `y` is 1000, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-998, 1000, -998, 1000)`, `ans` is the minimum of the `K-1`th elements of all `times` calculated for each `y` in the range from -1000 to 1000.**
