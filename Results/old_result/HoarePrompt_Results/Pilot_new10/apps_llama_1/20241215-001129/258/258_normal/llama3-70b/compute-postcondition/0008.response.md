The given code is `times.sort()`. This code sorts the list `times` in-place, meaning that it modifies the original list.

The initial state is: 
- `x` is -1000, 
- `y` is -999, 
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, 
- `ans` is the K-1th element of the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`, 
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`.

However, the code `times.sort()` does not change the values of `x`, `y`, `K`, `ans`, or `N`. It only sorts the list `times`. 

But since `times` is already the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`, sorting it again will not change its value. 

So the output state is: 
- `x` is -1000, 
- `y` is -999, 
- `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, 
- `ans` is the K-1th element of the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`, 
- `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`.

Output State: **`x` is -1000, `y` is -999, `K` is an integer such that 1 <= `K` <= `N`, `ans` is the K-1th element of the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)`, `times` is the sorted result of `func_2(-1000, -999, -1000, -999)**
