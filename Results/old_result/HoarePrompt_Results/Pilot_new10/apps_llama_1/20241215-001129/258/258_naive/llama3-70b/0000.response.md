Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not accurately implement the problem description. In the `func_2` function, the program is supposed to calculate the time required for each piece of meat to be ready when the heat source is placed at coordinates `(X, Y)`. However, the `func_2` function is written in a way that it iterates over the list of meats and for each meat, it calculates the distance from that meat to itself (`x` and `y` are the coordinates of the meat, `X` and `Y` are also set to `x` and `y`), which is incorrect.

Moreover, the `func_3` function tries to find the optimal position of the heat source by iterating over all possible integer coordinates between `-1000` and `1000`. However, this approach is not only inefficient but also incorrect because the problem statement allows the heat source to be placed at any real number coordinates, not just integers.

The program also has issues with the `func_1` and `func_2` functions, which are not correctly implemented according to the problem statement. The `func_1` function calculates the distance between two points, but it does not take into account the hardness of the meat, which is an important factor in calculating the time required for the meat to be ready.

To fix this program, we would need to rewrite the `func_2` function to correctly calculate the time required for each piece of meat to be ready, and then modify the `func_3` function to find the optimal position of the heat source by minimizing the time required for `K` or more pieces of meat to be ready. We would also need to consider using a more efficient algorithm to find the optimal position, such as using a grid search or a more advanced optimization technique.

Here's a simple example of how the program could fail:

Input:
```
2 1
0 0 1
1 1 1
```

In this case, the program should return `1.0` because we can place the heat source at `(0.5, 0.5)` and both pieces of meat will be ready in `1.0` seconds. However, the program will not be able to find this optimal solution due to its incorrect implementation.
