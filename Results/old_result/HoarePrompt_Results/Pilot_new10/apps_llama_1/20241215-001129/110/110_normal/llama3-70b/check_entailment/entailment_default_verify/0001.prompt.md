You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
def func():
    (n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
    ans = min(k, (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1))
    print(ans / ((n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the problem as described. The problem is to maximize the expected value of caught fishes when k fishes are placed in a pond of size n x m and a scoop of size r x r is used. The program simply calculates the minimum of k and the number of possible positions of the scoop, which is not the correct approach to solve this problem.

For example, if we have a pond of size 3 x 3, a scoop of size 2 x 2, and 3 fishes, the program will output 2.0000000000 which is incorrect. However, this is actually the correct expected value for the given input as explained in the example. 

A counterexample can be found by using a larger input. For instance, if we have a pond of size 12 x 17, a scoop of size 9 x 9, and 40 fishes, the program will output a value that is not the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. 

The correct approach to solve this problem is to place the k fishes in a way that maximizes the expected value of caught fishes, which can be achieved by distributing the fishes as evenly as possible within the scoop's range. However, the provided program does not implement this approach.

To achieve the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes, we need to place the fishes in the cells that will be covered by the scoop in the most possible ways. This can be achieved by using a strategy like placing the fishes in the center of the pond or distributing them evenly within the scoop's range. However, the provided program does not implement any such strategy. 

The program only checks if the number of fishes is less than or equal to the number of possible positions of the scoop and outputs the minimum of these two values. This is not the correct way to calculate the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes. 

Therefore, the provided program does not correctly solve the given problem and a different approach should be used to achieve the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts integers n, m, r, and k as input, calculates the minimum of k and the area of a rectangle with sides (n - r + 1) and (m - r + 1), and then prints the ratio of this minimum value to the area of the rectangle, but does not handle potential edge cases such as division by zero or out-of-range inputs, and does not return any value, instead, it prints the result. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
