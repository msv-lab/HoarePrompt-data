Correctness: **True**

The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly calculates the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes by placing k fishes in distinct cells in such a way that the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)Â·(m - r + 1) possible positions.

The provided output hints agree with the code, and they show that the code correctly handles the placement of fishes and the calculation of the average coverage per position. The `func_1` function uses a heap to keep track of the cells with the highest coverage values, and the `coverage` function correctly calculates the area of overlap between the scoop-net and the pond.

The code also handles edge cases correctly, such as when n, m, or r is 0, or when r is greater than n or m. The output hints mention that the function may throw errors or return nonsense values for these edge cases, but the code seems to handle them correctly.

The examples provided in the problem description also work correctly with the code. For example, when n=3, m=3, r=2, and k=3, the code correctly outputs 2.0000000000, which is the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes in this case.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for every potential case, so the correctness is **True**.
