Correctness: **True**

The provided code seems to correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the average coverage per position by first finding the positions with the highest coverage values and then calculating the total coverage of these positions divided by the total possible positions. The `coverage` function correctly calculates the area of overlap between the scoop-net and the pond for a given position.

The code handles the edge cases correctly. The `coverage` function handles cases where `x` or `y` is at the edge of the pond or `r` is equal to `n` or `m`. The `func_1` function also handles cases where `n`, `m`, or `r` is 0, or `r` is greater than `n` or `m`, although these cases are not specified in the problem description.

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the code. For instance, in the first example, the code correctly places the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), and (2, 3), resulting in an expected value of 2.0.

The output hints for the functions also agree with the code, indicating that the code is correctly implemented.

Overall, the code seems to be correct and should work as expected for all potential cases.
