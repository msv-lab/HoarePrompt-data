The code calculates the total number of positions in a grid with dimensions `n` and `m` that can fit a sub-grid of size `r` by `r`. The variable `total_positions` is assigned this calculated value.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is the x component of the last tuple popped from `heap` if `k` is greater than 0 and `heap` is not empty, or undefined if `k` is 0 or `heap` is empty, `y` is the y component of the last tuple popped from `heap` if `k` is greater than 0 and `heap` is not empty, or undefined if `k` is 0 or `heap` is empty, `heap` is a list containing `max(n*m - k, 0)` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for the remaining cells, `total_coverage` equals the sum of the coverage values of the `min(k, n*m)` cells that were popped from `heap`, `total_positions` equals `(n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)`**
