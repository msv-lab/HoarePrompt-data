The code initializes a new variable `total_coverage` and assigns it the value `0`. The previous values of the variables `n`, `m`, `r`, `k`, `x`, `y`, and `heap` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is `n-1` if `n` is greater than 0 and undefined if `n` is 0, `y` is `m-1` if `m` is greater than 0 and undefined if `m` is 0, `heap` is a list containing `n*m` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` if `n` and `m` are greater than 0, or an empty list if `n` or `m` is 0, and `total_coverage` is 0**
