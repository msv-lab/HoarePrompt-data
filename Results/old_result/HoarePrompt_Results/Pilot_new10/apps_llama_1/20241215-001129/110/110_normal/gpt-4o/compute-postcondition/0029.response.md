The value of `total_coverage` is updated by subtracting `cov` from it. The initial value of `total_coverage` is 0, so the new value of `total_coverage` becomes `-cov`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The value of `cov` is the negative coverage of the cell at position `(x, y)`, which implies that `-cov` is the actual coverage of the cell at position `(x, y)`. Therefore, the new value of `total_coverage` is the actual coverage of the cell at position `(x, y)`.

Output State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `x` is the x component of the smallest tuple in the `heap` (or undefined if the heap is empty), `y` is the y component of the smallest tuple in the `heap` (or undefined if the heap is empty), `cov` is the negative coverage of the cell at position `(x, y)` (or undefined if the heap is empty), `heap` is a list containing `n*m - 1` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for `x` ranging from 0 to `n-1` and `y` ranging from 0 to `m-1` if `n` and `m` are greater than 0 and `heap` is not empty, or an empty list if `n` or `m` is 0 or `heap` is empty, `total_coverage` is `-cov` or the actual coverage of the cell at position `(x, y)`**
