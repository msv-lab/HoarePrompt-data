To determine the output state after executing the given Python code, let's break down the effects of the code on the variables and data structures involved.

The code `heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))` pushes a new tuple onto the heap. The tuple contains three elements: `-coverage(x, y)`, `x`, and `y`. Given that `x` is 1 and `y` is 1, the tuple being pushed onto the heap is `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)`.

The `coverage` function is not defined in the provided context, so we'll treat its result as a variable value. Let's denote `coverage(1, 1)` as `c`. Then, the tuple being pushed is `(-c, 1, 1)`.

The initial state mentions that `heap` is a list containing at least two tuples, including `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)`. Let's denote `coverage(1, 0)` as `d`. Then, one of the tuples in `heap` is `(-d, 1, 0)`.

After pushing the new tuple onto the heap, the heap will contain at least three tuples: `(-d, 1, 0)`, and the newly added `(-c, 1, 1)`, along with at least one more tuple (since the initial state specifies that `heap` contains at least two tuples).

Now, considering the initial state and the effect of the code:

- `n` is greater than 1.
- `m` is greater than 1.
- `r` is a non-negative integer.
- `k` is a non-negative integer.
- `x` is 1.
- `y` is 1.
- `heap` is a list containing at least three tuples, including `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)` and the newly added `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)`.

Since `coverage(1, 1)` and `coverage(1, 0)` are not defined, we keep them as variable expressions. The only change is the addition of a new tuple to the `heap`.

Therefore, the output state after executing the code is:
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `m` is greater than 1, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a non-negative integer, `x` is 1, `y` is 1, and `heap` is a list containing at least three tuples, including `(-coverage(1, 0), 1, 0)` and `(-coverage(1, 1), 1, 1)`**
