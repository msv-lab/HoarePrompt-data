According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. If `_` (the loop counter) is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute again, `_` must be increased by 1. Since `_` is the loop counter, it starts from 0, so after the first iteration, `_` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `k` must be greater than 2 (because `_` is now 1 and it needs to be less than `k` to execute again), and the rest of the states remain the same.

State: **`n` and `m` are non-negative integers, `r` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 2, `x` is the x component of the popped tuple, `y` is the y component of the popped tuple, `cov` is the negative coverage of the popped cell, `heap` is a list containing `n*m - 2` tuples of the form `(-coverage(x, y), x, y)` for the remaining cells, `total_coverage` equals `-2*cov`**
