You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: While Grisha was celebrating New Year with Ded Moroz, Misha gifted Sasha a small rectangular pond of size n × m, divided into cells of size 1 × 1, inhabited by tiny evil fishes (no more than one fish per cell, otherwise they'll strife!).

The gift bundle also includes a square scoop of size r × r, designed for fishing. If the lower-left corner of the scoop-net is located at cell (x, y), all fishes inside the square (x, y)...(x + r - 1, y + r - 1) get caught. Note that the scoop-net should lie completely inside the pond when used.

Unfortunately, Sasha is not that skilled in fishing and hence throws the scoop randomly. In order to not frustrate Sasha, Misha decided to release k fishes into the empty pond in such a way that the expected value of the number of caught fishes is as high as possible. Help Misha! In other words, put k fishes in the pond into distinct cells in such a way that when the scoop-net is placed into a random position among (n - r + 1)·(m - r + 1) possible positions, the average number of caught fishes is as high as possible.


-----Input-----

The only line contains four integers n, m, r, k (1 ≤ n, m ≤ 10^5, 1 ≤ r ≤ min(n, m), 1 ≤ k ≤ min(n·m, 10^5)).


-----Output-----

Print a single number — the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

You answer is considered correct, is its absolute or relative error does not exceed 10^{ - 9}. Namely, let your answer be a, and the jury's answer be b. Your answer is considered correct, if $\frac{|a - b|}{\operatorname{max}(1,|b|)} \leq 10^{-9}$.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 3 2 3

Output
2.0000000000

Input
12 17 9 40

Output
32.8333333333



-----Note-----

In the first example you can put the fishes in cells (2, 1), (2, 2), (2, 3). In this case, for any of four possible positions of the scoop-net (highlighted with light green), the number of fishes inside is equal to two, and so is the expected value. [Image]
Program:
```
import heapq
import sys

input = sys.stdin.read
(n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(f'{func_1(n, m, r, k):.10f}')

def func_1(n, m, r, k):

    heap = []
    for x in range(n):
        for y in range(m):
            heapq.heappush(heap, (-coverage(x, y), x, y))
    total_coverage = 0
    for _ in range(k):
        (cov, x, y) = heapq.heappop(heap)
        total_coverage -= cov
    total_positions = (n - r + 1) * (m - r + 1)
    return total_coverage / total_positions

def coverage(x, y):
    return (min(x + 1, n - r + 1) - max(x - r + 1 + 1, 0)) * (min(y + 1, m - r + 1) - max(y - r + 1 + 1, 0))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python program is designed to solve the problem of maximizing the expected value of caught fishes in a pond by placing k fishes optimally. The program uses a greedy approach with a priority queue to select the positions that provide the highest coverage for the fishing net.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1.  **Initialization**: The program initializes the variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `k` from the input, representing the size of the pond, the size of the fishing net, and the number of fishes.
2.  **Coverage Calculation**: The `coverage` function calculates the number of possible positions where the fishing net can be placed to catch a fish at a given location `(x, y)`. This calculation is correct, taking into account the boundaries of the pond and the size of the fishing net.
3.  **Greedy Approach**: The program uses a greedy approach with a priority queue to select the positions that provide the highest coverage for the fishing net. It pushes the positions onto the heap with their negative coverage values as priorities, ensuring that the positions with the highest coverage are popped first.
4.  **Total Coverage Calculation**: The program calculates the total coverage by summing up the coverage values of the selected positions. This is done by popping `k` positions from the heap and subtracting their negative coverage values from the total coverage.
5.  **Expected Value Calculation**: The program calculates the expected value of caught fishes by dividing the total coverage by the total number of possible positions where the fishing net can be placed. This calculation is correct and aligns with the problem description.

To verify the correctness of the program, we can analyze the provided examples:

*   For the input `3 3 2 3`, the program correctly outputs `2.0000000000`, which is the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.
*   For the input `12 17 9 40`, the program correctly outputs `32.8333333333`, which is the maximum possible expected number of caught fishes.

Given that the program works correctly for the provided examples and follows a sound logical approach, it is reasonable to conclude that the program is correct. However, without exhaustive testing, it's impossible to prove correctness for all possible inputs. But based on the given examples and the program's logical structure, the conclusion is that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

input = sys.stdin.read
(n, m, r, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(f'{func_1(n, m, r, k):.10f}')

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x and y are integers such that 0 <= x < n and 0 <= y < m, and n, m, and r are integers that represent the dimensions of the pond and the scoop-net, where n and m represent the size of the pond and r represents the size of the scoop-net, and 1 <= n, m <= 10^5 and 1 <= r <= min(n, m).
