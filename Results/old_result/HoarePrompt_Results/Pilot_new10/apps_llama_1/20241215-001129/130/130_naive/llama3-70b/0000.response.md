Correctness: **True**.

The provided Python function seems to correctly solve the problem based on the given description and constraints. It checks two conditions:

1. If the number of friends (`M`) is greater than or equal to the number of coins Ivan doesn't have (`N - K + 1`) and the number of new coins he must receive (`L`). This ensures that each friend can give Ivan a unique coin, and the total number of new coins he receives is at least `L`.

2. If the conditions in step 1 are met, the function prints `1`, indicating that each friend only needs to give Ivan one coin to satisfy the conditions.

3. If the conditions are not met, the function prints `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to satisfy all the conditions.

This logic aligns with the problem description and examples provided, and it correctly handles the constraints and requirements outlined in the problem. The function assumes that each friend can give Ivan one unique coin, and the total number of new coins is at least `L`. If this assumption is met, the function provides the minimum number of coins each friend can give Ivan; otherwise, it indicates that it is impossible to meet the conditions.

The program seems to cover all potential cases and edge cases based on the given problem description and constraints. It correctly checks the conditions for the minimum number of coins each friend can give Ivan and prints the correct result based on those conditions. Therefore, the program appears to be correct based on the provided description and constraints.
