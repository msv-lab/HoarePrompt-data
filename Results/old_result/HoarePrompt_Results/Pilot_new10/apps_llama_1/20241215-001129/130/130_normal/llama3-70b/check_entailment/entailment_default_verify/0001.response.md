To determine the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided output hints, let's analyze the situation step by step.

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to find the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift to Ivan, given certain conditions. These conditions are: all friends gift the same number of coins, all coins gifted are different, and at least \(L\) coins from the gifts must be new to Ivan's collection.

2. **Original Assessment**: The original assessment claims the program is incorrect because it doesn't handle cases where \(M > N - K + 1\) but \(M < L\), and it suggests a more optimal solution that calculates the minimum coins each friend needs to give to satisfy the condition of having at least \(L\) new coins.

3. **Output Hints**: The output hints describe the function's behavior as reading four integers \(N\), \(M\), \(K\), and \(L\), and then checking if \(M\) is greater than or equal to both \(N - K + 1\) and \(L\), printing \(1\) if true, otherwise printing \(-1\). This description aligns with the provided code.

4. **Analysis**: The original assessment points out potential shortcomings in the program's logic, particularly in scenarios where the number of friends (\(M\)) is greater than the number of new coins Ivan could potentially receive (\(N - K + 1\)) but less than the number of new coins required (\(L\)). However, the code provided and the output hints focus on a simpler condition: whether \(M\) meets both the criteria of being greater than or equal to \(N - K + 1\) and \(L\), in which case each friend only needs to give 1 coin to satisfy the conditions.

Given the problem description and the provided code, the code seems to oversimplify the problem by not considering scenarios where \(M < L\) but could potentially satisfy the condition by giving more than 1 coin each. The correct implementation should indeed consider these scenarios and calculate the minimum number of coins each friend needs to give to ensure at least \(L\) new coins are gifted, as suggested in the original assessment.

The output hints do not provide additional scenarios or constraints that would contradict the original assessment. Instead, they describe the current behavior of the function, which aligns with the provided code but does not address all potential cases outlined in the problem description.

**Conclusion**: Based on the analysis, the original assessment correctly identifies a limitation in the program's logic. The provided code and output hints do not refute the original assessment but rather confirm its observations about the code's behavior and limitations.

**Final: False**
