The function func does not accept any parameters, but it reads four integers N, M, K, and L from the standard input. The code calculates the value of `min_x` as `(L + M - 1) // M` and checks if `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`. If the condition is met, it prints the value of `min_x`; otherwise, it prints -1.

Functionality: ** The function reads four integers N, M, K, and L from the standard input and prints the smallest integer `min_x` such that `M * min_x` is greater than `L` and `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`, or prints -1 if no such integer exists **
