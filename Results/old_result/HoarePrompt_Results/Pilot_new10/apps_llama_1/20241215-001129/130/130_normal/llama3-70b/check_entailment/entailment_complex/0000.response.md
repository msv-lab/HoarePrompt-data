Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

The problem description asks for the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift to satisfy three conditions: 
1. Everyone must gift as many coins as others.
2. All coins given to Ivan must be different.
3. Not less than L coins from gifts altogether, must be new in Ivan's collection.

The program checks if `M` (the number of friends) is greater than or equal to both `N - K + 1` and `L`. If this condition is true, it prints 1, indicating that each friend only needs to gift one coin. However, this approach is overly simplistic and does not accurately represent the minimum number of coins required to satisfy the conditions.

A more accurate approach would involve checking if `M * x >= L` and `M * x <= N - K + M * x`, where `x` is the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift. This ensures that the total number of coins gifted is at least `L` and that all coins are different.

The program does not handle cases where `M` is less than `N - K + 1` or `L` correctly. It simply prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to satisfy the conditions. However, this may not always be the case. For example, if `M` is less than `N - K + 1` but each friend can gift more than one coin, it may still be possible to satisfy the conditions.

To correctly solve the problem, a more sophisticated approach is needed, involving calculations to determine the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift to satisfy the conditions. The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description and may not produce the correct results for all possible inputs. 

For example, consider the case where `N = 10`, `M = 2`, `K = 5`, and `L = 3`. The program would print 1, indicating that each friend only needs to gift one coin. However, this is not sufficient to guarantee that at least `L` coins are new, as the two friends may gift the same coin. A more accurate solution would involve checking if `2 * x >= 3` and `2 * x <= 5 + 2 * x`, where `x` is the minimum number of coins each friend needs to gift. This would result in `x = 2`, indicating that each friend needs to gift at least 2 coins. 

Therefore, the provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description and is incorrect.
