Correctness: **True**

The program is a Python function that determines the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy the given conditions. The conditions are that all friends must gift as many coins as others, all coins given to Ivan must be different, and not less than L coins from gifts altogether must be new in Ivan's collection.

The function reads four integers N, M, K, and L from the standard input, where N is the quantity of different coins, M is the number of Ivan's friends, K is the size of Ivan's collection, and L is the quantity of coins that must be new in Ivan's collection.

The function calculates the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy the conditions. It uses the formula `min_x = (L + M - 1) // M` to calculate the smallest integer `min_x` such that `M * min_x` is greater than or equal to `L`. This ensures that not less than L coins from gifts altogether will be new in Ivan's collection.

The function then checks if `M * min_x` is less than or equal to `N - K`. If this condition is met, it means that there are enough different coins available to satisfy the conditions, and the function prints `min_x`. Otherwise, it prints -1, indicating that it is impossible to satisfy all the conditions.

The provided examples demonstrate the correctness of the function. For example, when N = 20, M = 15, K = 2, and L = 3, the function correctly prints 1, as one coin from each friend is enough to satisfy the conditions.

The function handles all potential cases correctly. It correctly calculates the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy the conditions and checks if there are enough different coins available. If the function did not work correctly for every potential case, it would not produce the expected output for the provided examples or for other valid inputs.

The code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
