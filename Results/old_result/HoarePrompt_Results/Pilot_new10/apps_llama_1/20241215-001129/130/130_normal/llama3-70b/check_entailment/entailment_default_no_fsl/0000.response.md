Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. It only checks if `M` is greater than or equal to both `N - K + 1` and `L`, and prints `1` if the condition is true, otherwise prints `-1`. However, this does not guarantee that the minimum number of coins that each friend must gift is found.

A counterexample is when `N = 10`, `M = 2`, `K = 5`, and `L = 3`. In this case, the program will print `-1`, but it is possible to distribute 3 new coins to Ivan by having each friend gift 3 coins (since 2 friends can gift 2 different sets of 3 coins, ensuring at least 3 new coins are given).

The correct solution should consider the number of new coins that can be guaranteed to be given to Ivan, taking into account the number of friends, the number of coins Ivan already has, and the number of different coins available. 

Another issue with the code is that it does not check if `M * x >= L` where `x` is the minimum number of coins one friend can gift to satisfy all the conditions. This condition is necessary to ensure that at least `L` new coins are given to Ivan. 

Therefore, the code does not work correctly for every potential case.
