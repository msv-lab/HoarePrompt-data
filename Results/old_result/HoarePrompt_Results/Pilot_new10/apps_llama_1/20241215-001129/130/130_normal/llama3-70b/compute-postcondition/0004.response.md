The given code simply prints -1, which does not affect the values of the variables `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L`. The print statement is an output operation and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the values of `N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` remain unchanged, and their relationship that either `M` is less than `N - K + 1` or `M` is less than `L` also remains valid. The value -1 is returned at the output.
Output State: **`N`, `M`, `K`, and `L` are integers where their values are determined by the user's input, `N` equals the first input integer, `M` equals the second input integer, `K` equals the third input integer, and `L` equals the fourth input integer, either `M` is less than `N - K + 1` or `M` is less than `L`, and the value -1 is returned at the output.**
