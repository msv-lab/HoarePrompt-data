Correctness: **True**

The given Python program correctly solves the problem of finding the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes.

Here's why the code is correct:

1. The `func_1(n)` function accurately calculates the number of trailing zeroes in `n!` by counting the factors of 5 in all the numbers up to `n`. This is because trailing zeroes are created by factors of 2 and 5, and since there are usually more factors of 2, the limiting factor is the number of factors of 5.

2. The `func_2(m)` function uses binary search to find the first `n` such that `n!` has `m` trailing zeroes. Once it finds this `n`, it then checks the neighboring numbers to find the range of `n` values that have `m` trailing zeroes.

3. The program handles the case where there are no `n` values that have `m` trailing zeroes, in which case it prints `0`.

4. The program also correctly handles the case where there are `n` values that have `m` trailing zeroes, in which case it prints the count of such `n` values and then prints the `n` values themselves.

I couldn't find any potential case that the program does not handle correctly. The code seems to be well-structured and follows the problem description accurately. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
