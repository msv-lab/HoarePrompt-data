Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not accurately solve the problem. It attempts to find the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. However, the logic used in the program is flawed.

The program first tries to find the power of 5 (count) that is closest to m by incrementing count until n // 5 ** count >= m. This part of the code does not make sense because the variable n is always 1 at this point.

After that, it tries to find all numbers n such that n // 5 ** count < m and adds them to the answer list. This logic is also incorrect because it does not take into account the actual number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of n.

To correctly solve this problem, we need to find the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of each number n, which can be done by counting the number of factors of 5 in all numbers from 1 to n. We can use the formula n // 5 + n // 25 + n // 125 +... until the quotient becomes 0.

Here's an example of a correct solution:

```python
def func():
    m = int(input())
    ans = []
    n = 1
    while True:
        count = n // 5 + n // 25 + n // 125 + n // 625 + n // 3125 + n // 15625 + n // 78125 + n // 390625 + n // 1953125 + n // 9765625 + n // 48828125 + n // 244140625
        if count > m:
            break
        if count == m:
            ans.append(n)
        n += 1
    print(len(ans))
    print(' '.join(map(str, ans)))

```

This program correctly finds the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes and prints these numbers in increasing order. 

For example, given the input 1, it correctly prints 5 and then prints 5 6 7 8 9, which are the numbers whose factorials end with exactly 1 zero. 

However, the original provided program does not work as expected, so its Correctness is **False**.
