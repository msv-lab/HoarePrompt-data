To determine the output state, we need to consider the impact of the given code on the initial state.

1. `left` is decremented by 1, so its new value is `(low + high) // 2 - 2`.
2. The condition that `left` must allow `func_1(left)` to potentially equal `m` is still valid, but the specific value of `left` has changed.
3. The values of `m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `(low + high) // 2 - 2` and must allow `func_1(left)` to potentially equal `m`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, and `result` is an empty list `[]`**
