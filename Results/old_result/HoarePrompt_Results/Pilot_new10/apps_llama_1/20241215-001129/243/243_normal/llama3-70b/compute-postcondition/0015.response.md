The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` was 2, so the new value of `count` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `count` is 3, `n` is 1, and if `n // 5` is less than `m` then `result` is `n`, else `result` is not defined.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `count` is 3, `n` is 1, and if `n // 5` is less than `m` then `result` is `n`, else `result` is not defined**
