The code snippet provided is a `break` statement, which terminates the loop it is currently inside. The initial state describes various variables and their relationships.

Output State: **`left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, `m` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `low` retains its initial value, `high` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, `zeroes` retains its initial value, `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal the initial value of `m` (or `mid + 1` if no such value exists), `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
