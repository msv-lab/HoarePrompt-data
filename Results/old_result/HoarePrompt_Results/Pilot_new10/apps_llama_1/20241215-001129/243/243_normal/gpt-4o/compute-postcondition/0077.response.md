The code `right += 1` increments the value of `right` by 1. Given that `right` initially equals `mid + 2`, after the execution of the code, `right` will equal `mid + 3`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `zeroes` equals `m`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000` with `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, and `right` equals `mid + 3` and `func_1(right)` may or may not equal `m`**
