The code `result = list(range(left + 1, right))` assigns the variable `result` a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

The initial values of `m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `left`, `zeroes`, and `right` are unchanged except that `left` was previously decremented until `func_1(left)` did not equal `m`, and `right` was the smallest value greater than the initial `mid` for which `func_1(right)` did not equal `m`. 

The value of `result` is now a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `n` satisfies `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`, and `right` is the smallest value greater than the initial `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal `m`**
