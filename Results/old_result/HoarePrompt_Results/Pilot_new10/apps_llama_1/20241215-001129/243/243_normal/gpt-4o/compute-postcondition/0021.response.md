`right` is assigned the value of `mid + 1`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
`left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, `m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `result` retain their initial values or the values determined before the loop starts.
Output State: **`left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, `m` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `low` retains its initial value, `high` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, `zeroes` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, `right` is equal to `mid + 1`**
