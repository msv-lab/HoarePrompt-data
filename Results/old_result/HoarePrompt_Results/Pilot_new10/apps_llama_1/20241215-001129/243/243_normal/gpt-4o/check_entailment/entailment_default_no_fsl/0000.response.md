Correctness: **True**

The code correctly solves the problem of finding the number of positive integers n such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. 

The code uses a helper function `func_1` to calculate the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a given number `n`. This function is correct as it uses the fact that a trailing zero is created by a pair of 2 and 5. Since there are more factors of 2 than 5 in the factorial of a number, the number of trailing zeroes is determined by the number of factors of 5.

The main function `func_2` uses a binary search approach to find the range of numbers `n` where `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. Once it finds a number that satisfies this condition, it expands outwards to find the entire range of numbers that have exactly `m` trailing zeroes.

The code handles all potential cases correctly, including edge cases where there are no numbers with exactly `m` trailing zeroes (in which case it returns an empty list) and cases where there are multiple numbers with exactly `m` trailing zeroes (in which case it returns a list of all such numbers). 

The provided examples demonstrate that the code works correctly, and the output hints agree with the code. Therefore, the code is correct for every potential case.
