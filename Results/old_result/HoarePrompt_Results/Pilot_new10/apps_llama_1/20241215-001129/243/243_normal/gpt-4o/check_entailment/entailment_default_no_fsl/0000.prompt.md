You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description,  print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure the hints agree with the code.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Mr. Santa asks all the great programmers of the world to solve a trivial problem. He gives them an integer m and asks for the number of positive integers n, such that the factorial of n ends with exactly m zeroes. Are you among those great programmers who can solve this problem?


-----Input-----

The only line of input contains an integer m (1 ≤ m ≤ 100 000) — the required number of trailing zeroes in factorial.


-----Output-----

First print k — the number of values of n such that the factorial of n ends with m zeroes. Then print these k integers in increasing order.


-----Examples-----
Input
1

Output
5
5 6 7 8 9 
Input
5

Output
0


-----Note-----

The factorial of n is equal to the product of all integers from 1 to n inclusive, that is n! = 1·2·3·...·n.

In the first sample, 5! = 120, 6! = 720, 7! = 5040, 8! = 40320 and 9! = 362880.
Functions with output description for each function:
m = int(input())
result = func_2(m)
if result:
    print(len(result))
    print(' '.join(map(str, result)))
else:
    print(0)

Function number 1 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_1(n):
    """ Return the number of trailing zeroes in n! """
    count = 0
    power_of_5 = 5
    while n >= power_of_5:
        count += n // power_of_5
        power_of_5 *= 5
    return count
''' 

 Output hints for function1:  The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `n`, calculated by summing the integer divisions of `n` by all powers of 5 less than or equal to `n`.
Function number 2 :
 Code:
 '''
def func_2(m):
    """ Find all numbers n such that n! ends with exactly m trailing zeroes """
    (low, high) = (0, 5 * (m + 1))
    result = []
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        zeroes = func_1(mid)
        if zeroes < m:
            low = mid + 1
        elif zeroes > m:
            high = mid - 1
        else:
            result = []
            left = mid
            while func_1(left) == m:
                left -= 1
            right = mid + 1
            while func_1(right) == m:
                right += 1
            result = list(range(left + 1, right))
            break
    return result
''' 

 Output hints for function2:  The function accepts a positive integer `m` and returns a list of consecutive integers `n` where `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes, or an empty list if no such integers are found, assuming the helper function `func_1` works correctly and the input `m` is within the expected range.



Does the code do what  the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
