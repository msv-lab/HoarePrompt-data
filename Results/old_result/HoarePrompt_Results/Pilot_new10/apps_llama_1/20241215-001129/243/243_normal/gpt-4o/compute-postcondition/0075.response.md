The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `zeroes` equals `m`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000` with `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, and `right` equals `mid + 2` and is such that `func_1(right - 1)` equals `m`.

Output State: **`left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `zeroes` equals `m`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000` with `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, and `right` equals `mid + 2`**
