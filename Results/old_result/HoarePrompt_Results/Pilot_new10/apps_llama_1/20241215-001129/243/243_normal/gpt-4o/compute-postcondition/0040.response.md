To determine the adjustments needed for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(left) == m`. 

Given that `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000` and `left` is `(low + high) // 2`, for the loop to execute at least one time, `func_1(left)` must equal `m`. 

However, without the specific definition of `func_1`, we can infer that the loop's execution depends on the value of `left` producing a result equal to `m` when passed through `func_1`. 

Thus, the state needs to be adjusted so that `func_1(left)` equals `m`. Since `left` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, we need to ensure that there exists a value of `left` (or equivalently, a range defined by `low` and `high`) such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`.

Since we do not have the definition of `func_1`, we cannot determine a specific range for `left` or a specific adjustment to `low` and `high`. However, we can state that for the loop to execute, `left` must be such that `func_1(left)` equals `m`, and the range defined by `low` and `high` must allow for such a `left` to exist.

State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is `(low + high) // 2` and must produce `m` when passed through `func_1`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, and `result` is an empty list**
