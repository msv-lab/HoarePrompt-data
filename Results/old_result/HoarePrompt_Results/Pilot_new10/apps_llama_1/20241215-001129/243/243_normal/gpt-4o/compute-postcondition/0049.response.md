The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `right` is `mid + 1`, so the new value of `right` is `mid + 2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `n` satisfies `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` and `mid` must be less than the least value `x` where `func_1(x)` equals `m`, `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list, `right` is `mid + 2`**
