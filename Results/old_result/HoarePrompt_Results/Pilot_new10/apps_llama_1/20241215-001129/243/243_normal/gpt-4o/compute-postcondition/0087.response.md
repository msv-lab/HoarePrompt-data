The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `m`. `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 100000. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of integers. This list is either empty or contains integers from a calculated range `left + 1` to `right - 1`, where the range is determined based on the relationship between the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid` and the original value of `m`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter m, a positive integer between 1 and 100000, and returns a list of integers within a calculated range or an empty list based on the relationship between the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of mid and m.**
