The value of `right` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is unchanged, `n` satisfies `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list, and `right` is `right + 1` such that `func_1(right)` may or may not equal `m`.
