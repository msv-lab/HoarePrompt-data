The function `func` accepts no parameters. However, it is described to be related to a positive integer `m`, which represents the required number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of a number, with the constraint that 1 <= m <= 100000.


Since there is no explicit description of the output, let's consider the general context of finding the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial, which typically involves finding the smallest number whose factorial has `m` trailing zeroes.


Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to return the smallest number whose factorial has `m` trailing zeroes, where `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000.
Functionality: **The function returns the smallest number whose factorial has m trailing zeroes, where m is a positive integer between 1 and 100000.**
