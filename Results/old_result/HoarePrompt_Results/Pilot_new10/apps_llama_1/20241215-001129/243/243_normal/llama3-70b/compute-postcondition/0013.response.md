The `break` statement does not modify the values of any variables. It only terminates the loop or switch statement it is directly inside. 

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `count` is 2, `n` is 1, and if `n // 5` is less than `m` then `result` is `n`, else `result` is not defined, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
