`count` is incremented by 1. The initial value of `count` is 1, so the new value of `count` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `count` is 2, `n` is 1, and if `n // 5` is less than `m` then `result` is `n`, else `result` is not defined**
