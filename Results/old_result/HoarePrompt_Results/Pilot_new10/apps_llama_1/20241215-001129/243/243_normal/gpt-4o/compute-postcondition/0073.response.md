To determine the output state after running the given Python code, we first need to understand the initial state and how the code affects it.

- `left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`.
- `zeroes` remains equal to `m`.
- `result` is an empty list `[]`.
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, with `n` satisfying `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m` before the loop started.
- The code snippet is `right = mid + 1`.

Given this information, we analyze the impact of the code:

1. **Variable Introduction**: The code introduces a new variable `right` and assigns it the value of `mid + 1`. The variable `mid` is not defined in the initial state, so we assume it is defined elsewhere in the code or it's a part of the context not provided.

2. **Dependency on `mid`**: Since `right` is defined as `mid + 1`, its value directly depends on the value of `mid`. Without the specific value of `mid`, `right` can be any integer value greater than `mid` by 1.

3. **No Change to Other Variables**: The code does not modify the values of `left`, `zeroes`, `result`, or `m`. These variables retain their initial state values.

4. **Assumption on `mid`**: For the purpose of this analysis, we assume `mid` has a defined value, even though its specific value or how it's calculated isn't provided in the initial state or the code snippet.

Therefore, considering the given initial state and the code's effect:

- `left` remains the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`.
- `zeroes` remains equal to `m`.
- `result` remains an empty list `[]`.
- `m` remains a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, with `n` satisfying `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`.
- A new variable `right` is introduced, with its value being `mid + 1`, where `mid` is assumed to have a defined value not specified in the initial state.

Output State: **`left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `zeroes` equals `m`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000` with `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, and `right` equals `mid + 1`.**
