The code assigns the variable `result` a list of numbers from `left + 1` to `right - 1` (since the `range` function in Python is exclusive of the end value). 

The values of `m`, `n`, `low`, `high`, `mid`, `zeroes`, and `left` and `right` are not affected by this code. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, `m` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `low` retains its initial value, `high` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, `zeroes` retains its initial value, `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal the initial value of `m` (or `mid + 1` if no such value exists), and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.

Output State: **`left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, `m` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `low` retains its initial value, `high` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, `zeroes` retains its initial value, `right` is the first value greater than `mid` for which `func_1(right)` does not equal the initial value of `m` (or `mid + 1` if no such value exists), and `result` is a list of integers from `left + 1` to `right - 1`.**
