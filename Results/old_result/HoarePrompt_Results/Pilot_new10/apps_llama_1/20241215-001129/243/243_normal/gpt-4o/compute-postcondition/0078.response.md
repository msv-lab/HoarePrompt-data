To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we must analyze the condition that allows the loop to continue. The loop will execute as long as `func_1(right)` equals `m`. 

Given the states at the end of the previous iteration:
- `left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`.
- `zeroes` equals `m`.
- `result` is an empty list `[]`.
- `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000` with `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`.
- `right` equals `mid + 3` and `func_1(right)` may or may not equal `m`.

The loop condition depends solely on `func_1(right)` being equal to `m`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. Since `right` equals `mid + 3` and its relation to `m` through `func_1(right)` is the critical factor, we must ensure that `func_1(right)` equals `m` for the loop to continue.

Other states like `left`, `zeroes`, `result`, and the conditions around `m` and `n` do not directly influence the loop's condition. Hence, they do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again.

State: **`left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `zeroes` equals `m`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000` with `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, and `right` equals `mid + 3` with `func_1(right)` equal to `m`**
