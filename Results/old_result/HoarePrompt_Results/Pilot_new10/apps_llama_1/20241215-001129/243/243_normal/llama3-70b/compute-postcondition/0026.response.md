The code snippet is a `break` statement. This statement does not change the values of any variables, but it breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

The values of `n`, `count`, and `ans` remain the same, which are `n` is 2, `count` is 1, and `ans` is [1]. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is 2, `count` is 1, `ans` is [1] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

Output State: **`n` is 2, `count` is 1, `ans` is [1] and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
