The code updates the value of `high` to `mid - 1`. The values of `m`, `n`, `low`, `mid`, and `zeroes` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` is less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `high` is `mid - 1`, and `zeroes` is equal to `func_1(mid)`**
