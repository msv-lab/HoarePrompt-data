According to the code, the loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely until it encounters a `break` statement. Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine if there is a `break` statement inside the loop.

Given that it is a `while True` loop, the loop can certainly execute one more time regardless of the current state of the variables. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`m` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000 (inclusive), `count` is 2, `n` is 1, and if `n // 5` is less than `m` then `result` is `n`, else `result` is not defined**
