The value of `left` is decreased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, `n` should satisfy the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` and `high` must be such that `left` (calculated as `(low + high) // 2 - 3`) allows `func_1(left)` to potentially equal `m`, `zeroes` is equal to `m`, and `result` is an empty list `[]`.
