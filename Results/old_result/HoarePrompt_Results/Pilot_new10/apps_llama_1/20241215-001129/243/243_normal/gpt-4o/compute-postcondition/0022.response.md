According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and the function `func_1(right)` equals `m`. If `func_1(right)` equals `m`, the loop can execute. Right before the loop, `left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, which suggests that `func_1(left)` does not equal `m` but does not provide information about `func_1(right)`. Since `right` is equal to `mid + 1`, for the loop to execute, `func_1(mid + 1)` must equal `m`. 

Given that `left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, it implies that there was a point where `func_1(left)` equalled `m` before the decrement. This information, however, does not directly affect the state of `right` or the condition for the loop to execute. The condition `func_1(right) == m` needs to be satisfied for the loop to execute. Therefore, the adjustment needed is that `func_1(right)` (or `func_1(mid + 1)`) must equal `m`.

State: **`left` is decremented to the point where `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, `m` retains its initial value, `n` retains its initial value, `low` retains its initial value, `high` retains its initial value, `mid` retains its initial value, `zeroes` retains its initial value, `result` retains its initial value, `right` is equal to `mid + 1`, and `func_1(right)` must equal `m`**
