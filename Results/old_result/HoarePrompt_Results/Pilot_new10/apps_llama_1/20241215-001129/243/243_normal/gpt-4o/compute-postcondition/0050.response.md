To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the condition of the `while` loop, which is `func_1(right) == m`. For the loop to execute again, this condition must still be true after the previous iteration. 

Given that:
- `m` is unchanged,
- `n` satisfies `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, which doesn't directly affect the loop condition but is related to `m`,
- `low` and `high` are unchanged, indicating they are not directly involved in the loop condition,
- `mid` is `(low + high) // 2` and must be less than the least value `x` where `func_1(x)` equals `m`, which implies `func_1(mid)` does not equal `m`,
- `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, which suggests that `left` is used to find a boundary condition but doesn't directly influence the loop condition,
- `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, which also doesn't directly impact the loop condition,
- `result` is an empty list, which doesn't affect the loop condition,
- `right` is `mid + 2`, and for the loop to continue, `func_1(right)` must still equal `m`.

For the loop to execute one more time, the critical condition is that `func_1(right)` must equal `m`. Since `right` is `mid + 2`, and there's no direct information about how `func_1` behaves with increasing input, we need to ensure that the relationship between `right` (or `mid`) and the function `func_1` is such that `func_1(right)` equals `m` after the adjustments.

Given that `mid` must be less than the least value `x` where `func_1(x)` equals `m`, and `right` is `mid + 2`, we can infer that `right` needs to be such that it still satisfies `func_1(right) == m`. This implies that the least value `x` where `func_1(x)` equals `m` should be less than or equal to `right` for the loop to continue, but since `mid` (and thus `right`) is adjusted based on `low` and `high`, and `low` and `high` are unchanged, it suggests that the adjustment of `mid` (and consequently `right`) is within the range where `func_1` could potentially equal `m`.

Since `right` is derived from `mid`, and `mid` is a function of `low` and `high`, which are unchanged, the condition that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is related to ensuring that `func_1(right)` still equals `m`. This implies that the value of `right` (derived from `mid + 2`) must be such that it still falls within the range where `func_1` of that value could equal `m`.

State: **`m` is unchanged, `n` satisfies `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list, and `right` must be such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`**
