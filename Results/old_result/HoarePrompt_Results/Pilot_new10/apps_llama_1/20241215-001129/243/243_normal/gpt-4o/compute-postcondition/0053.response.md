The code increments the value of `right` by 1. The previous value of `right` was such that `func_1(right)` equals `m`. The states of the other variables are not affected by the code.

Output State: **`m` is unchanged, `n` satisfies `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`, `low` and `high` are unchanged, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, `left` is decremented until `func_1(left)` does not equal `m`, `zeroes` equals the number of trailing zeroes in the factorial of `mid`, `result` is an empty list, and `right` is `right + 1`, where previously `func_1(right)` equals `m`**
