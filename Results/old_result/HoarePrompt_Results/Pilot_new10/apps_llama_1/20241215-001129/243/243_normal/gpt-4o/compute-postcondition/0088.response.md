The function `func_2` accepts a positive integer parameter `m` and returns a list of integers. 

The function attempts to find all numbers `n` such that `n!` ends with exactly `m` trailing zeroes. 

It uses a binary search approach to narrow down the range of possible values for `n`. 

Once it finds a value of `n` where `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes, it expands its search to the left and right of `n` to find all consecutive values that also have exactly `m` trailing zeroes. 

If no such values are found, it returns an empty list. 

However, the actual functionality of the code is more complex due to the missing definition of `func_1`, which calculates the number of trailing zeroes in a factorial. 

Assuming `func_1` works as intended, the code should return a list of consecutive integers where each integer's factorial has exactly `m` trailing zeroes. 

But, if `func_1` does not work correctly or the input `m` is outside the expected range, the function's behavior may be undefined or incorrect.

The code also has a potential edge case where `m` is 0, which is not explicitly handled in the annotations or the code. 

In this case, the function may not behave as expected, since the definition of "trailing zeroes" for `m = 0` is not clearly defined.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `m` and returns a list of consecutive integers `n` where `n!` has exactly `m` trailing zeroes, or an empty list if no such integers are found, assuming the helper function `func_1` works correctly and the input `m` is within the expected range. **
