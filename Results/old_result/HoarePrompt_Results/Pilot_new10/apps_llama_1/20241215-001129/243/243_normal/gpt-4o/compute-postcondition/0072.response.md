To find the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, let's analyze the loop's behavior based on the provided information.

The loop continues as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`. The function `func_1(left)` is not explicitly defined, but based on the context, it seems to relate to calculating the number of factors of 5 in all numbers up to `left`, given the condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m`. This formula is typically used to calculate the number of trailing zeros in the factorial of a number `n`, which is equivalent to finding the highest power of 5 that divides `n!`.

The loop decrements `left` by 1 in each iteration. It stops when `func_1(left)` no longer equals `m`, meaning it finds the smallest value of `left` for which the number of factors of 5 (or trailing zeros in the factorial) is less than `m`.

Given the output states after 1, 2, and 3 iterations, we can see that `left` is decremented by 1 in each iteration, starting from `(low + high) // 2`. The loop continues as long as `func_1(left)` equals `m`, implying that it searches for a boundary condition where the number of trailing zeros (or factors of 5) changes.

After all iterations, `left` will be the smallest value such that `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, or in other words, the largest value for which `func_1(left)` equals `m` plus one. However, since the loop stops when `func_1(left)` is no longer equal to `m`, the final value of `left` will actually be the first value for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`.

Since `zeroes` is equal to `m` and does not change throughout the iterations, and `result` remains an empty list `[]`, these variables do not provide additional insights into the final state of `left` but indicate that the loop's purpose is to find a specific boundary related to `m`.

The condition `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m` suggests that `m` represents the number of trailing zeros in `n!` (factorial of `n`). The loop, by decrementing `left`, effectively searches for the lowest `n` (represented by `left`) that satisfies this condition, given the constraint that `func_1(left)` must equal `m`.

Therefore, the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed can be described as follows:

Output State: **`left` is the first value less than or equal to the original `(low + high) // 2` for which `func_1(left)` is less than `m`, `zeroes` remains equal to `m`, `result` is an empty list `[]`, and `m` is a positive integer such that `1 <= m <= 100000`, with `n` satisfying `n//5 + n//25 + n//125 +... = m` before the loop started.**
