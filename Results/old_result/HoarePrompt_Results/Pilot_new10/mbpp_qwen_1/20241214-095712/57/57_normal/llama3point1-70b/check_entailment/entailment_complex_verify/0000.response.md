Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists based on their lowercase versions. The annotation clearly describes that the function processes a list of lists where each element is a string and returns a new list of lists where each inner list is sorted accordingly. Given these details, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
