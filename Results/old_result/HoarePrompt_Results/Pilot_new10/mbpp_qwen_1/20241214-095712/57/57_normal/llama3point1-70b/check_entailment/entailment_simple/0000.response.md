Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (where each element of the inner lists is a string) as input and returns a new list of lists where each inner list is sorted based on the strings' lowercase versions. This is achieved using a list comprehension that iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists`, sorts it using `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)`, and then collects these sorted sublists into a new list.

This solution works for any input list of lists containing strings, as the `key=str.lower` parameter ensures that sorting is done case-insensitively. Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
