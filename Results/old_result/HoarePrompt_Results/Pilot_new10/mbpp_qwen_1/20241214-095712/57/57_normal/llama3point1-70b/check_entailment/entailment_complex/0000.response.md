Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists (`list_of_lists`) as input, where each element of the inner lists is a string. It then returns a new list of lists where each inner list is sorted based on the lowercase version of its string elements. This is exactly what the problem description requires. The use of a list comprehension with the `sorted` function and `key=str.lower` ensures that each sublist is sorted according to the lowercase versions of its elements, which fulfills the requirement. Therefore, the program is correct.
