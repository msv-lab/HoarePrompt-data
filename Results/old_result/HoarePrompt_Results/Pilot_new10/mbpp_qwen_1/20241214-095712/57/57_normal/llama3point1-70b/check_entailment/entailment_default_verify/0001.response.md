Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists using `str.lower` as the key, ensuring case-insensitive sorting. The output hints also confirm that the function processes a list of lists containing strings and returns a new list of lists with each inner list sorted based on the lowercase version of its string elements. There are no edge cases or inputs mentioned that would make this function incorrect under the given problem description and assumptions about valid inputs.
