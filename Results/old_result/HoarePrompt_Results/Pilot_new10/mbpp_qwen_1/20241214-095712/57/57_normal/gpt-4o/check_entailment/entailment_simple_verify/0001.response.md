Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each sublist and applies the `sorted()` function to sort the elements within each sublist. The provided test cases cover various scenarios including different lengths of sublists, spaces in string elements, and different characters (like 'z' vs 'g'). Since the function works correctly for these cases and the logic is sound, the original assessment that the program is correct according to the problem description is accurate.
