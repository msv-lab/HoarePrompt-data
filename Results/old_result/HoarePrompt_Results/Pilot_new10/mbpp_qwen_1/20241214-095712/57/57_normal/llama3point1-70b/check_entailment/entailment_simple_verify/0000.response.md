Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. The use of `sorted(sublist, key=str.lower)` ensures that the sorting is case-insensitive, as required. The annotated version confirms that the function processes each sublist appropriately and returns a new list of sorted sublists. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
