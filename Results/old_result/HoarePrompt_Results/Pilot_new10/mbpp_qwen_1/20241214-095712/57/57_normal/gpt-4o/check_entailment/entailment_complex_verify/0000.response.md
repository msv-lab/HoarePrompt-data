Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input and returns a new list where each sublist is sorted in ascending order. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including sublists with different lengths and sublists containing strings with leading spaces. The program handles these cases correctly, and the annotated code aligns with the original assessment, indicating that the program is indeed correct.
