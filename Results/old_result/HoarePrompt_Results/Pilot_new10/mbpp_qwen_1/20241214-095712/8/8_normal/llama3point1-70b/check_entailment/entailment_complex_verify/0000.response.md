Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the original assessment and the problem description. The function correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string. The annotations accurately describe the behavior of the function under different scenarios, such as when the character appears only once, more than once, or not at all in the string. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
