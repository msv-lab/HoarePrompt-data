You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. Here's why:

1. **First Occurrence Removal**: The `find` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the character, and if it exists, it is removed along with its instance in the string using `replace(char, '', 1)`.

2. **Last Occurrence Removal**: The `rfind` method returns the index of the last occurrence of the character. If the first and last occurrences are the same, only the first occurrence is removed. Otherwise, the characters between these two indices are removed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the character is not found in the string, both `find` and `rfind` will return `-1`, and the function returns the original string.
   - If the first and last occurrences are the same, the character is replaced only once.
   - If the first and last occurrences are different, the substring between them is removed.

Given these considerations, the program handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and char is a single character string.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #The program returns the string 's' with the first occurrence of 'char' replaced by an empty string
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns a string from `s` with the character `char` removed at both `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` indices
    else :
        return s
        #The program returns string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `char`. If `char` appears only once in `s`, it returns `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed. If `char` appears more than once in `s`, it returns `s` with the characters at both the first and last occurrences of `char` removed. If `char` does not appear in `s`, it returns `s` unchanged.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
