The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `ch`, which is a single character string. 

- In Case_1, the function returns the string `s`.
- In Case_2, the function returns a substring of `s` excluding the characters at `first_index` and `last_index`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and return either the entire string `s` or a substring of `s` excluding specified indices based on the conditions provided.
