Postcondition: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the lowest index where `ch` is found in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`; `last_index` is the highest index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`. The condition `first_index != -1 and last_index != -1 and first_index != last_index` is false.**
