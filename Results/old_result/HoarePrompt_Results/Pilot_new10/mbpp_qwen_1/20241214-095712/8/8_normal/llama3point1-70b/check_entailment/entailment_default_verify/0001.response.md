Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment incorrectly states that the function removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. However, based on the provided code and the output hints, the function actually removes the first occurrence and the last occurrence only if they are different. If the first and last occurrences of the character are at the same index, the function only removes the first occurrence. This behavior contradicts the problem description, which asks to remove both the first and last occurrences regardless of their positions. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate.
