Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It handles all the mentioned test cases and additional edge cases:
- If the character is not found in the string, it returns the original string (e.g., `func_1('hello', 'z')` would return `'hello'`).
- If the character is found only once, it returns the original string (e.g., `func_1('hello', 'h')` would return `'hello'`).
- If the character is found multiple times, it removes the first and last occurrences (e.g., `func_1('abcda', 'a')` returns `'bcd'`).

The code logic checks for these conditions and behaves as expected in all scenarios. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
