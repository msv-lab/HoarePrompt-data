Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` and a character `ch`, and removes the first and last occurrences of `ch` from the string `s`. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Identifying Indices**: The program correctly uses `s.find(ch)` to find the first occurrence of `ch` and `s.rfind(ch)` to find the last occurrence of `ch`.

2. **Edge Cases Handling**: 
   - If `ch` is not found in `s`, both `first_index` and `last_index` will be `-1`. In this case, the function returns `s` without any changes.
   - If `ch` is found but there is only one occurrence, `first_index` and `last_index` will be the same. The function correctly returns `s` without making any modifications.

3. **String Modification**: When both `first_index` and `last_index` are valid and different, the function constructs a new string by slicing `s` to exclude the characters at these indices.

The test cases provided in the annotations also validate the behavior:
- `func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'`: Removes the first and last 'l'.
- `func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'`: Removes the first and last 'a'.
- `func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'`: Removes the first and last 'P'.

Since the function correctly handles all scenarios described in the problem statement, the program is correct.
