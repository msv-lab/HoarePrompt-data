Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. However, upon closer inspection, the function does not handle the case where the first and last occurrences of the character are the same index. This means if the character appears only once in the string, the function will remove both the first and last occurrence, which is incorrect. For example, the output hint mentions that the function should return the original string if `ch` is not found or found only once, but the current implementation does not adhere to this behavior. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate.
