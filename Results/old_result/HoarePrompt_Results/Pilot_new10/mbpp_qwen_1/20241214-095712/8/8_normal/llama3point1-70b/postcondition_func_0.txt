The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a single character string `char`. If `char` appears only once in `s`, it returns `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed. If `char` appears more than once in `s`, it returns `s` with the characters at both the first and last occurrences of `char` removed. If `char` does not appear in `s`, it returns `s` unchanged.
