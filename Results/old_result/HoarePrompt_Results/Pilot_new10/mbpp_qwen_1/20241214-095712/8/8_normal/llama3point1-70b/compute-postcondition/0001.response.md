The code `last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)` finds the highest index of `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is not found in `s`, `last_occurrence` will be `-1`. The values of `s`, `char`, and `first_occurrence` remain unchanged.

- `s` is a string
- `char` is a single character string
- `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`
- `last_occurrence` is the highest index of `char` in `s`, or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`s` is a string, `char` is a single character string, `first_occurrence` is the index of the first occurrence of `char` in `s`, or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`; `last_occurrence` is the highest index of `char` in `s`, or `-1` if `char` is not found in `s`.**
