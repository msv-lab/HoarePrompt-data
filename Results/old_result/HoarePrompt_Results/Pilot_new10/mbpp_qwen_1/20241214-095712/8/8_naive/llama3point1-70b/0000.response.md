Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly removes the first and last occurrences of a given character from a string. Here's why:

1. **First Occurrence Removal**: The `find` method returns the index of the first occurrence of the character, and if it exists, it is removed along with its instance in the string using `replace(char, '', 1)`.

2. **Last Occurrence Removal**: The `rfind` method returns the index of the last occurrence of the character. If the first and last occurrences are the same, only the first occurrence is removed. Otherwise, the characters between these two indices are removed.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the character is not found in the string, both `find` and `rfind` will return `-1`, and the function returns the original string.
   - If the first and last occurrences are the same, the character is replaced only once.
   - If the first and last occurrences are different, the substring between them is removed.

Given these considerations, the program handles all potential cases correctly according to the problem description.
