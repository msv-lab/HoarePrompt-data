Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. Here's why:

- The function uses `s.find(ch)` to get the index of the first occurrence of the character and `s.rfind(ch)` to get the index of the last occurrence.
- If either the first or last occurrence cannot be found (`-1`), or if both indices are the same (indicating only one occurrence), the function simply returns the original string.
- Otherwise, it constructs a new string by slicing the original string to exclude these indices.

Given the test cases:
- `func_1('hello', 'l')` returns `'heo'` (correct).
- `func_1('abcda', 'a')` returns `'bcd'` (correct).
- `func_1('PHP', 'P')` returns `'H'` (correct).

Since the function handles edge cases and works as expected for the given examples, it appears to be correct for the described problem.
