Let's break down the problem step by step.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `target` is an integer.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Conditions**:
   - The loop iterates over the indices of the list `arr` in reverse order, starting from `len(arr) - 1` (the last index) down to `0`.
   - The loop variable `i` starts at `len(arr) - 1` and decreases by 1 in each iteration until it reaches `-1`.

4. **Adjusting the State**:
   - For the loop to start executing, the initial value of `i` must be `len(arr) - 1`.
   - The list `arr` must be non-empty because the loop starts from the last index of the list.

### Adjusted States:
- The state before the loop should include that `i` is initially set to `len(arr) - 1`.
- The list `arr` must have at least one element to ensure the loop starts.

### Final State:
```plaintext
State: **`i` is len(arr) - 1, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order**
```

This ensures that the loop can start executing as intended.
