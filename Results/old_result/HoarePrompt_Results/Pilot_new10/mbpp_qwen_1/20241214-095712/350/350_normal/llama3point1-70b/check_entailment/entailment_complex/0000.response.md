Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The annotated program does not correctly implement the required functionality. According to the problem description, the function should find the last position (not the first) of the target element in a sorted array. However, the provided implementation iterates through the array from the end to the beginning and returns the first index where the target is found, which is the last occurrence if the target exists multiple times. 

To meet the problem description, the function should iterate from the beginning to the end of the array and return the last index where the target is found. Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```

This version ensures that the function finds and returns the last occurrence of the target element in the array, adhering to the problem description.
