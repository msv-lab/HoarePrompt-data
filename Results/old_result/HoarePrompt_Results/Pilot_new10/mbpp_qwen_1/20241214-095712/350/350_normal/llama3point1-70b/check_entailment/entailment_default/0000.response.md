Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code searches for the last occurrence of the target element in a sorted array, but the problem description asks for the last position of the element, not the first occurrence. The function iterates through the array in reverse order and returns the index of the first occurrence where the target matches, which does not meet the requirement of finding the last position. For example, in a sorted array `[1, 2, 2, 2, 3]` with `target = 2`, the correct output should be `3`, but the function would return `1`.

To correct this, the function should be modified to continue searching until the end of the array or the target no longer matches. Here is an example of how it could be fixed:

```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] != target:
            return i + 1
    return -1
```

This corrected version will return the index of the last occurrence of the target element, or `-1` if the target is not found.
