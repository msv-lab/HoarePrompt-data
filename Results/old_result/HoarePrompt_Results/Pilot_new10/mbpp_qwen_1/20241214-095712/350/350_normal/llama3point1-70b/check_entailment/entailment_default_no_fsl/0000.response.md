Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` is intended to find the last position of an element in a sorted array, but the implementation actually finds the first occurrence of the target element instead. This is evident from the output hints, which state that the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `target` if it is found. To meet the problem description correctly, the function should iterate through the array from the beginning to the end, returning the last index where the target is found. The current implementation only checks the array in reverse order, starting from the last element.
