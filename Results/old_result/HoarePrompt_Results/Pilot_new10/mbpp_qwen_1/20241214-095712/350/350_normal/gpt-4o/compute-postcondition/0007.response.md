According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `arr`. The loop iterates from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`.

At the end of the previous iteration, the following conditions hold:
- `arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `x` is an integer.
- `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be greater than 0 (since the loop runs from `len(arr) - 1` down to `0`).

Given that `i` is currently `len(arr) - 2`, the loop can continue if `i` is not already 0. Therefore, `i` should be adjusted to `len(arr) - 3` for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`arr` is a list of non-negative integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `x` is an integer, `i` is `len(arr) - 3`.**
