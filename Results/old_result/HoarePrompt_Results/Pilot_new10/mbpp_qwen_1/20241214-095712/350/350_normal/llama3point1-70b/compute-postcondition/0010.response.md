Let's analyze the given loop and its behavior step by step to determine the final output state after all iterations have finished.

### Initial State
- `arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `target` is an integer.

### Loop Code
```python
for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
    if arr[i] == target:
        return i
```

### Observations from the First Few Iterations

1. **After 1 iteration:**
   - `i` is `len(arr) - 1`.
   - `arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `arr[i]` is not equal to `target`.

2. **After 2 iterations:**
   - `i` is `len(arr) - 2`.
   - `arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `arr[i]` is not equal to `target`.

3. **After 3 iterations:**
   - `i` is `len(arr) - 3` and `i` is greater than or equal to 0.
   - `arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `arr[i]` is not equal to `target`.

### General Pattern
From the above observations, we can infer that:
- After each iteration, `i` decreases by 1.
- The loop continues until it either finds `arr[i] == target` or `i` becomes less than 0.

### Final Output State
- **Case 1: The loop finds `arr[i] == target`:**
  - The function returns the index `i` where `arr[i] == target`.
  - `i` is the index found by the loop.

- **Case 2: The loop does not find `arr[i] == target`:**
  - The loop completes all iterations without finding a match.
  - The function does not return anything (or returns a default value as per the original behavior, which is not specified).

Given that the loop iterates from `len(arr) - 1` down to 0, the only way it won't find a match is if `arr[i] != target` for all `i` from `len(arr) - 1` down to 0.

### Conclusion
- `i` will either be the index where `arr[i] == target` or -1 (if the loop does not find any match).
- `arr` remains a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `target` remains unchanged.

### Output State:
**Output State: `i` is the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if `target` is present in `arr`; otherwise, `i` is -1, `arr` is a non-empty list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target` is an integer.**
