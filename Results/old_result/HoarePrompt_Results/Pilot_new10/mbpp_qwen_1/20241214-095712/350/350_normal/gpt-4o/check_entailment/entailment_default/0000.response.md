Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` iterates over the list `arr` in reverse order to find the last position of the element `x`. If `x` is found, it returns the index of `x`; otherwise, it returns `-1`. This approach works for all potential cases as specified in the problem description and the given test cases. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, iterating from the end of the list towards the start and returning the index of the last occurrence of `x` or `-1` if `x` is not found.
