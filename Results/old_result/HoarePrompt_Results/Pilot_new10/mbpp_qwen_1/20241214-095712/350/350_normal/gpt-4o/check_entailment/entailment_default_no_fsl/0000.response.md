Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates over the array in reverse order, which ensures that the first occurrence of the target element found is its last occurrence. The code handles all cases correctly as per the problem description and the examples provided:

- In the first assertion, the element `1` is found at index `0`, which is the last (and only) occurrence.
- In the second assertion, the element `1` is found at index `2`, which is the last occurrence of `1`.
- In the third assertion, the element `3` is found at index `3`, which is the last occurrence of `3`.

Since the code works correctly for the given examples and the logic aligns with finding the last occurrence of an element in a sorted array, the program is correct.
