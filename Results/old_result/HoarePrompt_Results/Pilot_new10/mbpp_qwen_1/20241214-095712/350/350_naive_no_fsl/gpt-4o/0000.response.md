Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function iterates through the array from the end to the beginning, which ensures that the first match found will be the last occurrence of the element. The function returns the index of the last occurrence, or `-1` if the element is not found. Based on the provided test cases and the logic of the function, it appears to handle all potential cases correctly.
