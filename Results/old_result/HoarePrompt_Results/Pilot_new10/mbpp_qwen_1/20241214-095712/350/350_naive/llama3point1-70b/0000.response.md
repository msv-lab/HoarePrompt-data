Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds the last position of an element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array from the end to the beginning and returns the index as soon as it finds the target element. If the target is not found, it returns -1. This approach ensures that the last occurrence of the target element is found, which aligns with the problem description. Since the program handles all elements correctly and works as expected for any potential case, the correctness is **True**.
