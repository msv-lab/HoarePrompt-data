Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `string` and `substring`, and checks if `substring` is present in `string`.
2. **Return Value**:
   - If `substring` is not found in `string`, the function returns `None`, which aligns with the requirement to return `None` when there is no match.
   - If `substring` is found, the function returns a tuple containing the starting index (`start`) of the first occurrence and the ending index (`end - 1`), which is `start + len(substring) - 1`.

3. **Correctness of Conditions**:
   - The use of `string.find(substring)` correctly identifies the starting index of the substring in the string. If the substring is not found, `find` returns `-1`, and the function correctly returns `None`.
   - If the substring is found, the function calculates the ending index correctly as `start + len(substring) - 1`.

Given these points, the program accurately implements the specified behavior for all cases, making it correct according to the problem description.
