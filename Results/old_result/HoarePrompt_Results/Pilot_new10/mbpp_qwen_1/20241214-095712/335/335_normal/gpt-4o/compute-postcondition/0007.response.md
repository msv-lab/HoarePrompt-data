Let's analyze the annotated code step by step:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `main_string` (a string) and `sub_string` (a non-empty string).
2. It first finds the starting position (`start_pos`) of `sub_string` within `main_string` using the `find` method.
3. If `start_pos` is `-1`, it means `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, and the function returns `None`.
4. If `sub_string` is found, it calculates the ending position (`end_pos`) as `start_pos + len(sub_string)`.
5. Finally, the function returns a tuple containing `sub_string`, `start_pos`, and `end_pos`.

From the code, we can see that the function performs the following:
- It searches for `sub_string` in `main_string`.
- If `sub_string` is found, it provides the starting and ending positions of `sub_string` in `main_string`.
- If `sub_string` is not found, it returns `None`.

There are no apparent edge cases mentioned in the annotations that are missing from the code, and the code does exactly what the annotations describe.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `main_string` and a non-empty string `sub_string`. It returns `None` if `sub_string` is not found in `main_string`, otherwise it returns a tuple containing the found substring, its starting position, and its ending position in `main_string`.**
