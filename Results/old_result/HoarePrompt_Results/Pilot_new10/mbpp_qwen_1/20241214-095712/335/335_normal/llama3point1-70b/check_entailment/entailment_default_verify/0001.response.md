Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is not entirely accurate. While the function `func_1` does correctly return `None` if the substring is not found, it does not fully adhere to the problem description. The problem description asks to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string, which implies returning multiple occurrences and their positions if they exist. However, the current implementation only returns the details of the first occurrence of the substring. Therefore, the function fails to meet the requirement for handling multiple occurrences of the substring within the string. The output hints also confirm this behavior by mentioning that the function returns the starting index of the first occurrence and the ending index. Thus, the original assessment should be revised to reflect this limitation.
