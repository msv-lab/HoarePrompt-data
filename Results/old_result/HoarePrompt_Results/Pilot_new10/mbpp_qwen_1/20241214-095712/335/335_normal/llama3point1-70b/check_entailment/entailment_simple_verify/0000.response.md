Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the problem description and the original assessment. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the occurrence and position of a substring within a string. It returns the substring along with its start and end positions if found, and `None` otherwise. Given the annotated version, the original assessment is accurate because the program behaves as expected under the given conditions.
