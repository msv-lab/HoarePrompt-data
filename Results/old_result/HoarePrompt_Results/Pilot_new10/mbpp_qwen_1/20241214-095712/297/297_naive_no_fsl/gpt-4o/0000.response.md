Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior for all tested cases. It takes a tuple of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The function works for tuples of different lengths, including the edge case of a tuple with only one element, which returns an empty tuple. Since the function passes all the assertions and handles all tested cases correctly, it appears to be correct for the given problem description.
