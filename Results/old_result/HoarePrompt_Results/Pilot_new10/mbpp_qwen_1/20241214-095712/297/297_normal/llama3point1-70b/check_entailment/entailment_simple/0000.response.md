Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Here's why:

- The function `func_1` takes a tuple `numbers` of length \(N+1\), where \(N\) is a non-negative integer.
- Inside the function, `tuple(a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:]))` generates a new tuple. For each pair \((a, b)\) from the zipped tuples `numbers` and `numbers[1:]`, it computes the product \(a \times b\).
- The tuple `numbers[1:]` represents a right-shifted version of the original tuple `numbers`. Therefore, for an input tuple \((t_1, t_2, \ldots, t_{N+1})\), the function generates a tuple \((t_1 \times t_2, t_2 \times t_3, \ldots, t_N \times t_{N+1})\).

This exactly matches the requirement specified in the problem description, which states that the function should return a tuple of length \(N\) where the \(i\)-th element is equal to \(t_i \times t_{i+1}\). Since the program adheres to this specification for any valid input tuple, the program is correct.
