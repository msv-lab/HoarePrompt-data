Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `t` of numbers and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the original tuple `t`. 

- The function iterates through the tuple using a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor, multiplying each element `t[i]` by the next element `t[i + 1]` for all valid indices up to `len(t) - 1`.
- It correctly handles cases where the input tuple has fewer than 2 elements by returning an empty tuple, as described in the problem description.

The provided assertions also validate the behavior of the function for different input cases, confirming its correctness according to the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
