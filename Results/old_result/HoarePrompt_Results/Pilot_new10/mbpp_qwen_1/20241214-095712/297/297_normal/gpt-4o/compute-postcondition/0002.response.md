The annotated code and the return postconditions indicate that the function `func_1` takes a tuple `t` of integers or floats with a length of \(N+1\) and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the original tuple `t`. 

Let's analyze the code step-by-step:

1. The function definition starts with `def func_1(t):`.
2. The function body contains a single line: `return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))`.

This line of code iterates over the range from `0` to `len(t) - 2` (inclusive), creating a tuple where each element is the product of `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]`.

Given the code and the annotations, we need to ensure we cover all potential cases:

- If `t` is a tuple of length 1 or 2, the function will still operate correctly, but the resulting tuple will be empty or contain one element respectively.
- The function does not handle tuples with fewer than 2 elements, so these cases should be noted.

Therefore, the functionality can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `t` of integers or floats with a minimum length of 2 and returns a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from `t`. For tuples with fewer than 2 elements, the function returns an empty tuple.**
