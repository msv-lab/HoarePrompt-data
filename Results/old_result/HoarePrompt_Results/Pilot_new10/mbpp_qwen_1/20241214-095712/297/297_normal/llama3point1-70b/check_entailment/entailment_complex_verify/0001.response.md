Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple of integers of length \(N+1\) and returns a tuple of length \(N\) where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The annotation clearly explains how the function processes the input tuple using `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` to pair each element with its successor and then multiplying them using a generator expression inside the `tuple()` constructor. Since the function behaves as expected for any valid input tuple, the original assessment is accurate.
