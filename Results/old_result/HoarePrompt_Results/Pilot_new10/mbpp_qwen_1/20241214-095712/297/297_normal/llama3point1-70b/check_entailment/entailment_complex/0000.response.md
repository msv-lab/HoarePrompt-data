Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown:

- The function `func_1` takes a tuple `numbers` of length \(N+1\) where \(N\) is a non-negative integer.
- It uses a generator expression within a `tuple` constructor to create a new tuple. The generator expression `a * b for a, b in zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` iterates over pairs of consecutive elements in `numbers`, multiplying them together.
- The `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` creates pairs such that the \(i\)-th pair consists of `numbers[i]` and `numbers[i+1]`. This ensures that the resulting tuple has length \(N\), as required.
- Each element in the returned tuple corresponds to the product of an element from the original tuple and the next element in the sequence, fulfilling the requirement specified in the problem description.

Since the implementation accurately performs the specified operation for any valid input tuple, the program is correct.
