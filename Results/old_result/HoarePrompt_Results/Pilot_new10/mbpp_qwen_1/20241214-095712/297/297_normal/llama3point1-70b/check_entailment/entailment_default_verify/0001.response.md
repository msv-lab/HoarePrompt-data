Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to take a tuple of numbers `(t_1, t_2, ..., t_{N+1})` and return a new tuple where each element is the product of consecutive elements from the input tuple. The output hints confirm this behavior, showing that the function shifts the tuple one position to the right and calculates the product of each element with its successor. Since the function behaves as expected for any valid input tuple of length `N+1`, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
