`result` is assigned the value of `result` concatenated with `char`. Since `char` is an uppercase character from the string `s`, the value of `result` will become the concatenation of its current value and `char`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is a string with at least one character, `result` is `result` + `char`, a character from `s` is uppercase**
