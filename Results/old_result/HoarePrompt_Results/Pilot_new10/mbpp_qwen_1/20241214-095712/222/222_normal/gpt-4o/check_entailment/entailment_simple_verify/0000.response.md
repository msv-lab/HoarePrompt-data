Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the program does not meet the requirement of removing all lowercase substrings from the given string. The provided code only removes lowercase letters and leaves uppercase letters and other characters unchanged. This is evident from the annotated version where the function `func_1` constructs a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the input string. For instance, for the input `'aBcDe'`, the expected output is an empty string, but the program returns `'BCD'`, which is incorrect according to the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
