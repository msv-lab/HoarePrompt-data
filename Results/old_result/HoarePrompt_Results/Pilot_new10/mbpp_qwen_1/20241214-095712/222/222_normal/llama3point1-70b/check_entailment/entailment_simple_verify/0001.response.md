Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` appends only uppercase characters to the `result` string and ignores all lowercase characters. However, the problem description requires removing lowercase substrings entirely, not just filtering out lowercase characters. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and the original assessment is accurate.
