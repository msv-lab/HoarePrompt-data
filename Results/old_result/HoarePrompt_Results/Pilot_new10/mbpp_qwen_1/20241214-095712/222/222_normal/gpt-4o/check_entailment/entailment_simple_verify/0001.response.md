Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to remove lowercase substrings from a given string by keeping only the uppercase characters. The original assessment is accurate because the function works as intended for the provided test cases and there are no apparent issues or edge cases that would cause the function to fail based on the problem description.
