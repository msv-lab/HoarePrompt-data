Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing all the uppercase characters from `s`. This is achieved by iterating through each character in `s`, checking if it is uppercase using `char.isupper()`, and appending it to the `result` string if it is. The function handles all characters in the input string, including edge cases where the string is empty or contains no uppercase characters.**
