Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description, which states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Instead, the function only retains uppercase characters and discards all lowercase characters. 

To meet the problem description, the function should remove all lowercase letters from the input string `s`. Here's an example to illustrate why the current implementation is incorrect:

Given the input string `s = "HelloWorld"`, the expected output would be `"HW"` (removing all lowercase letters). However, the current implementation will produce `"HW"` as well, but this is not the intended behavior since the problem description asks to remove lowercase substrings, not just individual characters.

A corrected version of the function would be:

```python
def func_1(s):
    result = ''.join(c for c in s if not c.islower())
    return result
```

This corrected version uses a generator expression within `str.join()` to concatenate all characters that are not lowercase, effectively removing lowercase substrings as required by the problem description.
