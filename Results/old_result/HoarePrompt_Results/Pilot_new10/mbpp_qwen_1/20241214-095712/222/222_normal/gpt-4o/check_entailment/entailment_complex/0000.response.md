Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description because it removes all lowercase substrings instead of removing the lowercase characters. Specifically, the program constructs a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string, which means it retains the positions of uppercase characters and removes everything else, including any uppercase substrings that may contain lowercase characters within them. 

For example, according to the problem description, the function should remove lowercase substrings such that `func_1('PYTHon')` would ideally return `'PYTH'`, but the current implementation returns `'PYTH'`, which is correct in this specific case, but it will fail for strings like `'PYTHonSTRinG'`, where the expected output would be `'PYTHSTRG'`, but the program will return `'PYTHSTRG'`.

To correctly implement the problem description, the function should remove all lowercase characters regardless of their context. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([char for char in s if not char.islower()])
```

This corrected version will ensure that all lowercase characters are removed from the string, adhering to the problem description.
