You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    result = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.isupper():
            result += char
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `result` is a concatenation of all uppercase characters from the string `s`.
    return result
    #The program returns the concatenation of all uppercase characters from string 's'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns a new string containing all the uppercase characters from `s`. This is achieved by iterating through each character in `s`, checking if it is uppercase using `char.isupper()`, and appending it to the `result` string if it is. The function handles all characters in the input string, including edge cases where the string is empty or contains no uppercase characters.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
