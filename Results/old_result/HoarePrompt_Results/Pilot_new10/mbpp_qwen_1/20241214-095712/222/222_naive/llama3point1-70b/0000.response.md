Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the given string. According to the problem description, the function should remove all lowercase characters, but the current implementation only removes lowercase characters that are standalone and not part of substrings. For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the program will return "HW" instead of the expected "HelloWorld" since it does not consider substrings containing uppercase letters. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
