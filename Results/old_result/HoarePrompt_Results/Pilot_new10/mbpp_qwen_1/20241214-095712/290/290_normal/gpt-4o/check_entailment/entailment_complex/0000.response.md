Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks whether the character 'z' appears in the substring of the input string `s` that excludes the first and last characters. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should check if the string contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
2. **Implementation**:
   - The condition `if ('z' in s[1:-1]):` ensures that the search for 'z' is confined to the middle part of the string, i.e., all characters except the first and last.
   - If 'z' is found within this substring, the function returns `True`.
   - If 'z' is not found within this substring, the function returns `False`.

Let's verify the test cases:
- `assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True`: The substring is `'ythonzabc'`, and 'z' is present, so the function correctly returns `True`.
- `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False`: The substring is `'xyabc'`, and 'z' is not present, so the function correctly returns `False`.
- `assert func_1('  lang  .') == False`: The substring is `' ang  '`, and 'z' is not present, so the function correctly returns `False`.

Since the program adheres to the specified logic and passes all the test cases, it is correct according to the problem description.
