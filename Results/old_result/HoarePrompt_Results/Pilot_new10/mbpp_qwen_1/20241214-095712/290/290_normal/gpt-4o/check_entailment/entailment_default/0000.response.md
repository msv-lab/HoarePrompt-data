Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks if the string `s` contains the letter 'z' in the substring `s[1:-1]`, which excludes the first and last characters of the string. This exactly matches the problem description. The given assertions also validate this behavior:

- `func_1('pythonzabc.') == True` because 'z' is present in the substring 'ythonabc'.
- `func_1('zxyabc.') == False` because 'z' is not present in the substring 'xyabc'.
- `func_1('  lang  .') == False` because 'z' is not present in the substring ' lang '.

Since the code behaves as expected according to the problem description and the provided assertions, the program is correct.
