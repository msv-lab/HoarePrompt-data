Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code checks if the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character of the string contains the letter 'z'. However, this does not cover all potential cases. For instance, the function should also consider cases where 'z' is present in the middle of the string without being at the start or end. 

For example, `func_1('pythonzabc')` should return `True`, but the current implementation will return `False` because it does not check the entire string after removing the first and last characters. The function needs to ensure that 'z' is not at the start or end of the string.
