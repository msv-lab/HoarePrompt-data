Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s why:

- The function `func_1` checks if the string `s` contains the character 'z' in any position except the first and last characters.
- The condition `if ('z' in s[1:-1]):` ensures that the check is performed only on the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character of the string.
- If 'z' is found in this substring, the function returns `True`.
- Otherwise, if 'z' is not found in this substring, the function returns `False`.

Given the test cases:
- `assert func_1('pythonzabc.') == True`: The substring `pythonzabc.` (excluding the first and last characters) is `ythonzab`. Since 'z' is present in this substring, the function correctly returns `True`.
- `assert func_1('zxyabc.') == False`: The substring `zxyabc.` (excluding the first and last characters) is `xyzab`. Since 'z' is not present in this substring, the function correctly returns `False`.
- `assert func_1('  lang  .') == False`: The substring `  lang  .` (excluding the first and last characters) is ` lang `. Since 'z' is not present in this substring, the function correctly returns `False`.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all given cases.
