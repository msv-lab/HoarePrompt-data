Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the requirement to check if a string contains the letter 'z' in any word, except at the start and end of the word. The function splits the input string into words and iterates through each word. For each word with a length greater than 1, it checks if 'z' is present in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. If such a 'z' is found, the function immediately returns `True`. If no such 'z' is found in any word, the function returns `False`.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code handles all potential cases correctly. It ensures that 'z' is only checked within the middle of the word, as specified. There are no edge cases or examples provided in the hints that the code fails to handle properly. Therefore, the correctness of the code is confirmed to be true.
