Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately reflects the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function correctly checks if any word in the input string contains the letter 'z' (excluding the first and last characters) and returns `True` if such a condition is met for any word. Otherwise, it returns `False`. The original assessment is accurate because the function behaves as expected based on the problem description.
