Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if any word in the list of words derived from `s` has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' within the middle of the word (excluding the first and last characters). Otherwise, it returns `False`.** 

This summary covers the functionality based on the actual code and includes the key condition that needs to be met for the function to return `True`. The annotation mentioned checking the third word specifically, but the code checks every word in the list, making the more general description accurate.
