Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if a string contains the letter 'z' in the middle of each word, excluding the first and last characters of the word. It splits the input string into words and iterates through each word, checking if the length of the word is greater than 1 and if 'z' is present in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. If such a condition is met in any word, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False` after checking all words. This implementation meets the requirements for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
