Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program checks if the string `s` contains the character 'z' within the substring `s[1:-1]`. However, the problem description specifies that 'z' should not be at the start or end of the word. The test case `func_1('  lang  .') == False` is correct because there is no 'z' in the middle. But consider the string `'azbzc'`. According to the problem description, this should return `False` because 'z' is not at the start or end, but the current implementation would return `True`. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirement for all potential cases.
