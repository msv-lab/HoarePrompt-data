Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and verifying the length of the set. The output hints also confirm that the function works as expected for non-empty strings. Since the problem description specifies checking whether all characters are the same, and the function meets this requirement for all potential cases (as long as the input is a non-empty string), the original assessment is correct.
