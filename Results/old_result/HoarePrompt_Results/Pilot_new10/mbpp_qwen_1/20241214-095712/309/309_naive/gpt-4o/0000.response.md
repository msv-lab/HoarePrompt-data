Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in a string are the same. It handles the empty string case by returning `True`, which is correct since an empty string trivially has all characters the same. The function iterates through each character in the string and compares it to the first character. If any character is different, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all characters. The provided test cases also confirm its correctness:

- `func_1('python') == False`: The string 'python' has different characters.
- `func_1('aaa') == True`: The string 'aaa' has the same character repeated.
- `func_1('data') == False`: The string 'data' has different characters.

Since the function works correctly for these cases and there are no obvious edge cases or logical errors that could cause it to fail, the program is correct.
