Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. This logic is correct and works for all potential cases. Since the set of a string containing identical characters will always have a length of 1, and the set of a string containing different characters will have a length greater than 1, the function will correctly identify whether all characters in the string are the same or not. There are no edge cases or inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the problem description.
