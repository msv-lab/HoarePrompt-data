Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is either an empty list or contains characters, and the function returns False if the top element of `stack` does not match the corresponding opening bracket of `char`. Otherwise, `stack` remains unchanged.***
