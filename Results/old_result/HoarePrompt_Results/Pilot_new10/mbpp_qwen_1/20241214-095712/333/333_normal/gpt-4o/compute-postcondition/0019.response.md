The code `stack.append(char)` appends the character `char` to the list `stack`. Since `char` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot specify its exact value. However, we know that this operation adds a new element to the list `stack`.

The output state after executing the code will be:
- `expr` remains unchanged as a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces.
- `stack` now contains the original elements plus one additional element (the character `char`).
- `matching_pairs` remains unchanged as `{')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}`.

Output State: **`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` contains the original elements plus one additional element (the character `char`), `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}.**
