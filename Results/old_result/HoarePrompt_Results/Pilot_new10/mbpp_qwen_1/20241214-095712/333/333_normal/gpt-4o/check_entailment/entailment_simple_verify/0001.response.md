Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment appears to be incorrect. The annotated version clearly indicates that the function `func_1` processes only the specified bracket characters ('(', ')', '[', ']', '{', '}'), and it correctly handles the case where the expression is not balanced by returning `False`. Additionally, the function ignores any characters that are not part of the specified set of brackets, as per the annotated explanation. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and handles all valid inputs correctly.
