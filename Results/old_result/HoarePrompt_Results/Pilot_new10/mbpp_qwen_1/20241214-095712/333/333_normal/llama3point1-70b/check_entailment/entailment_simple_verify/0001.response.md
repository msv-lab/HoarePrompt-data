Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, braces, and square brackets. The function uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each corresponding closing bracket matches the last unmatched opening bracket. The function handles all potential cases where the expression is balanced or unbalanced, as described in the problem statement. The annotations indicate that the function behaves as expected, returning `True` if the expression is balanced and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
