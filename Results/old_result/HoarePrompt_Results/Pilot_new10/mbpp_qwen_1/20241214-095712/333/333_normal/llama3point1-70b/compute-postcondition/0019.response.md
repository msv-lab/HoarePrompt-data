The code `stack.append(char)` appends the character `char` to the list `stack`. Given the initial state where `stack` is either empty or contains the most recent opening bracket, after appending `char`, `stack` will now contain `char` along with whatever was in `stack` previously.

Output State: **`expression` must contain at least one character, `stack` contains the most recent opening bracket and the appended character `char`.**
