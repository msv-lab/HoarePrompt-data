Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements a function to check if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces. The function uses a stack to keep track of opening symbols and ensures that each closing symbol matches the most recent unmatched opening symbol. The test cases given in the assertions confirm that the function works as expected for the provided inputs:

- `{()}[{}]` returns `True` because all symbols are properly matched.
- `{()}[{]` returns `False` because the square bracket is not properly matched.
- `{()}[{}][]({})` returns `True` because all symbols are properly matched.

The code handles all potential cases where the expression can be balanced or unbalanced, and the output hints align with the functionality of the code. Therefore, the program correctly implements the required functionality for the given problem description.
