The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` containing only parentheses (`(`, `)`), square brackets (`[`, `]`), and curly braces (`{`, `}`) and returns `True` if the expression has correctly matched opening and closing brackets, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means all brackets are correctly matched; otherwise, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, resulting in a return value of `False`.
