The provided code does not alter the values of any variables; it only defines a dictionary `matching_pairs` that maps closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces; `stack` is an empty list; `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}**
