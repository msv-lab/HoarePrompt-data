State: **`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is an empty list, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'**, and `char` is the first character in the string `expr`. 

Step-by-step reasoning:
1. The loop iterates over each character in `expr`.
2. For the loop to start executing, `expr` must contain at least one character.
3. `stack` is initially empty.
4. `matching_pairs` remains unchanged and is a dictionary used for checking matching pairs of brackets.

Since the loop body is omitted, we need to ensure that the initial state of `expr` contains at least one character for the loop to execute. `stack` and `matching_pairs` are already correctly initialized as specified.

Therefore, the state to adjust is:
- `expr` must have at least one character.
- `char` is the first character in the string `expr`.

State: **`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is an empty list, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}, `char` is the first character in the string `expr`**.
