You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string containing only parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}').
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expression` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is empty or contains a sequence of opening brackets that correspond to the correct order of closing brackets, `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}. If the loop completes without returning False, the `expression` is correctly matched with no unmatched opening or closing brackets, and `stack` will be empty. Otherwise, if the loop returns False, the `expression` is incorrectly matched, and `stack` will contain unmatched opening brackets.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if the `stack` is empty, indicating that the `expression` is correctly matched with no unmatched opening or closing brackets; otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `expression` containing only parentheses (`(`, `)`), square brackets (`[`, `]`), and curly braces (`{`, `}`) and returns `True` if the expression has correctly matched opening and closing brackets, and `False` otherwise. The function uses a stack to keep track of opening brackets and ensures that each opening bracket has a corresponding closing bracket in the correct order. If the stack is empty at the end of the iteration, it means all brackets are correctly matched; otherwise, it means there are unmatched opening brackets, resulting in a return value of `False`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
