Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is either an empty list or contains characters, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. If the `char` in `matching_pairs` causes the function to return False (i.e., the stack is empty or the popped character does not match the corresponding opening bracket), the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues without returning a value, implying the condition was met.***
