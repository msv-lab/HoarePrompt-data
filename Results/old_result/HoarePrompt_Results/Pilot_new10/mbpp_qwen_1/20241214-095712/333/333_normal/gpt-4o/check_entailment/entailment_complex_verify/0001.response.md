Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly indicates that the function `func_1` is designed to handle strings containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces. The original assessment mentioned that the function does not handle non-bracket characters, but the annotations explicitly state that the function only processes valid characters (i.e., parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces). Therefore, the original assessment was based on an incorrect assumption about the input and functionality of the function. Since the provided test cases and the annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected within its defined scope, the original assessment should be considered inaccurate.
