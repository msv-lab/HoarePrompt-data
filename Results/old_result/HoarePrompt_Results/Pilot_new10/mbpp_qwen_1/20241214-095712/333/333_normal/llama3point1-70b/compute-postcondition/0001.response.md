The code defines a dictionary `brackets` which maps opening parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces to their corresponding closing characters. However, no operations are performed on the `expression` or `stack` variables in this snippet. Therefore, the `brackets` dictionary is created but does not affect the values of `expression` or `stack`.

Output State: **`expression` is a string containing only parentheses ('(', ')'), square brackets ('[', ']'), and curly braces ('{', '}'); `stack` is an empty list; `brackets` is {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}**
