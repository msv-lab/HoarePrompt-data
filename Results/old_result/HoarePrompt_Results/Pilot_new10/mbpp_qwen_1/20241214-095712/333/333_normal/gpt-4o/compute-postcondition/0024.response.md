Output State: **`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is either an empty list or a list of opening brackets in the order they were encountered, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. If `expr` is a valid sequence of nested and properly matched parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, the `stack` will be empty at the end of the loop. Otherwise, the `stack` will contain unmatched opening brackets.**

Explanation:
- The loop processes each character in the `expr` string.
- If the character is an opening bracket (one of the keys in `matching_pairs`), it is pushed onto the `stack`.
- If the character is a closing bracket (one of the values in `matching_pairs`), the function checks whether the `stack` is empty or if the top element of the `stack` matches the corresponding opening bracket. If not, the function returns `False`.
- After processing all characters in `expr`, the `stack` should be empty if every opening bracket has a matching closing bracket in the correct order. If there are any unmatched opening brackets left in the `stack`, the function will return `False`.

This ensures that the loop correctly verifies the validity of the expression `expr` with respect to balanced and properly nested brackets.
