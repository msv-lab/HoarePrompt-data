Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` does not handle non-bracket characters properly. According to the problem description, the function should check if the given expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces. However, the current implementation will raise a `TypeError` when it encounters a non-bracket character. While the output hints mention that the function should handle a string containing only valid characters, the provided code does not include logic to ignore or handle such characters. Therefore, the function is not correctly implemented as per the problem description.
