Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string containing only parentheses, square brackets, and curly braces, `stack` is an empty list, `matching_pairs` is {')': '(', ']': '[', '}': '{'}. If `char` is in the set of values of `matching_pairs` and the stack is not empty or the popped element from the stack is equal to the corresponding opening bracket of `char`, then the function does not change the state. If `char` is not in the set of values of `matching_pairs`, the function does not change the state.***
