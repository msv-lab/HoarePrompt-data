Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks for duplicates in the array by comparing the length of the array with the length of a set created from the array. If there are duplicates, the set will have fewer elements than the original array, making the lengths unequal. This approach works correctly for identifying duplicates in the array. The output hints confirm that the function returns `True` if there are duplicate elements in the list, and `False` if all elements are unique. There are no edge cases or examples provided in the hints that indicate the code is incorrect. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
