The code `seen.add(num)` adds the value of `num` to the set `seen`. If `num` was already in `seen`, the function returns `True` because adding it again would cause the `add` method to return `False` immediately, but since the condition checks if `num` is in `seen` before the addition, it returns `True`.

Given the initial state:
- `arr` is a list containing at least one integer.
- `seen` is a set containing `num`.

After running the code snippet, `num` is added to the set `seen`. If `num` was already in `seen`, the function returns `True`. The state of `arr` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list containing at least one integer, `seen` is a set containing `num`, and the function returns `True` if `num` was already in `seen`.**
