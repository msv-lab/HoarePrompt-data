Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate elements by comparing the length of the array with the length of the set of the array. If the lengths are not equal, it means there were duplicates in the original array. The annotated comments accurately describe the behavior of the function and the logic used. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
