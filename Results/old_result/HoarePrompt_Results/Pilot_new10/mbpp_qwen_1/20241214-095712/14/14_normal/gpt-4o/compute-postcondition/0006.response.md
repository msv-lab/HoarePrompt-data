Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `arr` is a list containing at least one integer.
   - The first integer in `arr` is `num`.
   - `seen` is a set containing `num`.
   - `num` is not in `seen` (this condition is no longer true).

2. **Understanding the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over each integer in `arr` using the variable `num`.

3. **Current State Analysis:**
   - Since `num` was the first integer in `arr` and it is now no longer in `seen`, the loop must have processed this integer and removed it from `arr` or updated `seen` to include `num`.

4. **Next Iteration Requirements:**
   - For the loop to execute again, `arr` must contain at least one more integer.
   - The new `num` will be the next integer in `arr`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - `arr` should now contain at least one more integer (since we need to iterate over the next integer).
   - `num` will be the next integer in `arr`.
   - `seen` will still contain all previously seen integers, but it will be updated to include the current `num`.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

- `arr` must contain at least one more integer.
- `num` will be the next integer in `arr`.
- `seen` will include all previously seen integers, including the new `num`.

State: **`arr` is a list containing at least two integers, the first integer in `arr` is `num`, `seen` is a set containing all previously seen integers including the new `num`**
