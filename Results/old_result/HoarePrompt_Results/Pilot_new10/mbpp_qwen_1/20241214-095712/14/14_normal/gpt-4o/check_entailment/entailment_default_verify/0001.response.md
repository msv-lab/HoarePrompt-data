Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided `func_1` function correctly identifies the presence of duplicate elements in an array using a set to track seen elements. The output hints also accurately summarize the functionality of the function, indicating that it accepts a list of integers and returns `True` if any duplicate is found, otherwise it returns `False`. The test cases provided in the original assessment cover various scenarios, including arrays with no duplicates, arrays with one duplicate, and arrays with multiple duplicates, and the function works correctly for these cases. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
