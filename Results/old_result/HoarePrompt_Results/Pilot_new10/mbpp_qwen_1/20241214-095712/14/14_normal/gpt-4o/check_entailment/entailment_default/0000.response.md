Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements a function to check for duplicates in an array of integers. It uses a set to keep track of seen elements. If an element is encountered that is already in the set, the function immediately returns `True`, indicating a duplicate was found. If no duplicates are found after checking all elements, the function returns `False`. The examples provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected:

- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5])` returns `False`, as there are no duplicates.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4])` returns `True`, as there is a duplicate `4`.
- `func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5])` returns `True`, as there are multiple duplicates.

Since the code handles all the provided test cases correctly and the logic is sound, it meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
