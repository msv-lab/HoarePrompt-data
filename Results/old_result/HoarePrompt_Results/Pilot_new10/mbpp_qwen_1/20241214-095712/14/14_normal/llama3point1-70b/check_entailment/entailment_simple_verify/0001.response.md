Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly identifies the presence of duplicate elements in an array by comparing the length of the array with the length of a set created from the array. The original assessment is accurate because the logic in the function works as intended: if there are duplicates, the set will contain fewer unique elements than the original list, leading to a difference in their lengths and thus a return value of `True`. If there are no duplicates, the lengths will match, and the function returns `False`. The annotated version aligns with this logic and confirms that the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
