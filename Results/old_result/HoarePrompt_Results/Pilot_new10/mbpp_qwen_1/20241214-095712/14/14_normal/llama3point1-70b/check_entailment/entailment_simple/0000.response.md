Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an array of integers as input and checks whether there are any duplicate elements in the array. It does this by comparing the length of the original array `arr` with the length of the set of `arr`. 

- If there are no duplicates, all elements in the array are unique, and converting the array to a set will remove any duplicates, making the lengths of both the array and the set equal.
- If there are duplicates, converting the array to a set will result in fewer unique elements than the original array, making the lengths of the array and the set different.

Therefore, the condition `len(arr) != len(set(arr))` correctly identifies the presence of duplicates. When the lengths are not equal, it returns `True`, indicating the presence of duplicates, and `False` otherwise, indicating no duplicates. This logic aligns perfectly with the requirement to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.
