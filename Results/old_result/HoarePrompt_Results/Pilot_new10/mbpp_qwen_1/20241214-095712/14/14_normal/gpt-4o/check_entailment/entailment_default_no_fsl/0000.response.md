Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a set to keep track of seen elements. For each element in the array, it checks if the element is already in the set. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating a duplicate was found. If no duplicates are found after checking all elements, it returns `False`. This logic correctly identifies the presence of duplicates in an array of integers.

The assertions provided cover several cases:
- An array with no duplicates (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`) returns `False`.
- An array with one duplicate (`[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]`) returns `True`.
- An array with multiple duplicates (`[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]`) returns `True`.

These cases confirm that the function works correctly for the given problem description and all potential cases.
