Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided `func_1` function uses a set to track seen elements, which correctly identifies the presence of duplicates in the array. The function iterates through each element in the array and checks if it has already been added to the set. If a duplicate is found, it returns `True`; otherwise, it continues until the end of the array and returns `False` if no duplicates are found. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including arrays with no duplicates, arrays with one duplicate, and arrays with multiple duplicates. Since the function works correctly for these cases and the logic handles the requirement effectively, the program is correct.
