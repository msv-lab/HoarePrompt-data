Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the presence of duplicate elements in an array by comparing the length of the array with the length of a set created from the array. If there are no duplicates, all elements in the array will be unique and the lengths will match. If there are duplicates, the set will contain fewer elements than the original array, making the lengths different. This logic works for all potential cases, as it accurately determines the presence of duplicates based on the size comparison. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for every potential case.
