Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input and returns a tuple containing two sublists:

1. The first sublist contains the elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the `L`-th element (`lst[:L]`).
2. The second sublist contains the elements from the `L`-th element to the end of `lst` (`lst[L:]`).

This matches the requirement of splitting the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`. The program handles all cases where `0 <= L <= len(lst)` appropriately, ensuring that the sum of the lengths of the two returned sublists equals the length of the original list. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
