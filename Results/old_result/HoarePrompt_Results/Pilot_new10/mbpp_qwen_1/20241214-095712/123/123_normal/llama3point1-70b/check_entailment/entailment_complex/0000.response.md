Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input, where \(0 \leq L \leq \text{len(lst)}\). The function then returns a tuple containing two lists:

1. The first list contains elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the `L`-th element.
2. The second list contains elements from the `L`-th element to the end of `lst`.

This exactly matches the requirement specified in the problem description. The slicing operations `lst[:L]` and `lst[L:]` ensure that the list is split at the correct index `L`, and the results are returned as a tuple. Therefore, the function behaves as intended for any valid input according to the constraints provided.
