Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list `lst` into two parts where the first part has a length of `L`, and the second part contains the remaining elements, as per the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for valid inputs, splitting the list at the specified index `L`. Since the problem description and the provided code align, and the function handles the specified case without any issues, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
