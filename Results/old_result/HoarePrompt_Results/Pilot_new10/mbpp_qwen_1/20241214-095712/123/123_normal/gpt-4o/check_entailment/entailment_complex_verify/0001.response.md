Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the provided assertions clearly demonstrate that the function `func_1` correctly splits the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L`. The original assessment is accurate because the function handles various types of inputs (lists of integers and lists of characters) and the provided examples cover different scenarios. The annotations further confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning a tuple with the appropriate slices of the input list.
