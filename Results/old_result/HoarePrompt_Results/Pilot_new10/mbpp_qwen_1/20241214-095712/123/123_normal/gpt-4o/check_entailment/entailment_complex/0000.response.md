Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L` as input. It then returns a tuple containing two slices of the list: the first slice `lst[:L]` contains elements from the start of the list up to but not including the element at index `L`, and the second slice `lst[L:]` contains elements starting from index `L` to the end of the list. This splitting ensures that the length of the first part of the list is exactly `L`. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs, covering both numerical and string lists. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
