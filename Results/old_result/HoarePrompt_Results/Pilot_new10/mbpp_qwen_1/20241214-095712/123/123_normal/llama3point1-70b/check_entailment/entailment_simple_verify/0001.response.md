Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly splits the input list `lst` into two parts where the first part has a length of `L`. The annotations clearly state that the function returns two lists: the first list contains the elements from the start of `lst` up to but not including the `L`-th element, and the second list contains the elements from the `L`-th element to the end of `lst`. This behavior aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
