Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and an integer `L` such that `0 <= L <= len(lst)`, and returns a tuple containing two slices: `lst[:L]` (a slice of `lst` up to index `L`) and `lst[L:]` (a slice of `lst` starting from index `L`). This operation effectively splits the list into two parts based on the index `L`.**
