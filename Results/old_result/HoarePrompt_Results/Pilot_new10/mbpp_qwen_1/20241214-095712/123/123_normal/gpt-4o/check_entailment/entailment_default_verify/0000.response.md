Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into two parts based on the integer `L` and returns them as a tuple. The output hints confirm that the function handles the specified cases correctly, splitting the list into two parts where the first part has a length of `L` and the second part contains the remaining elements. There are no apparent edge cases that would cause the function to fail under the given assumptions. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
