Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly adds a tuple to a list by converting the tuple to a list and then concatenating it with the input list. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, and there are no edge cases or potential scenarios where the function would fail based on the given problem description and assumptions about valid input. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
