#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and tpl is a tuple.
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
    #`The program returns a list that is the concatenation of 'lst' and a list converted from 'tpl'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, converts the tuple into a list, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the converted list from `tpl`.
