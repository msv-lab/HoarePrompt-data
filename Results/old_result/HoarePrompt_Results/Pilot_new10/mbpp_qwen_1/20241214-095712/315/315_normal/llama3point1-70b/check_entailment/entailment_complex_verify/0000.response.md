Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs, converts the tuple to a list, and then concatenates it with the input list. This matches the problem description of adding a given tuple to a given list. Since the annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected and there are no issues with the logic or edge cases, the original assessment is accurate.
