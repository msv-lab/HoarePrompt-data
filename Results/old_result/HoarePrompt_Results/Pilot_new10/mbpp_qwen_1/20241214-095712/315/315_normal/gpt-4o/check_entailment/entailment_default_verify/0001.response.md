Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly adds the elements of the given tuple to the end of the given list. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a list and a tuple, converts the tuple into a list, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the converted tuple. The test cases provided also validate this behavior, and there are no indications of edge cases being handled incorrectly based on the problem description and the output hints.
