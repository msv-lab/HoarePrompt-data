Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and the converted tuple to a list. This implementation correctly adheres to the problem description for all potential cases. Since converting a tuple to a list and appending it to another list is a straightforward operation and the function simply uses the `+` operator to concatenate these two sequences, it will work correctly in all scenarios without any edge cases being missed.
