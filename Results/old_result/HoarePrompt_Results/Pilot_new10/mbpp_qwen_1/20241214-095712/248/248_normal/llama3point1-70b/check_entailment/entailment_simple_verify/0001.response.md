Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly converts a given list into a tuple. The annotation indicates that the program returns a tuple containing all elements from the list `input_list`, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to convert a list to a tuple. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
