Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The annotated version confirms that the function takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing the same elements. The provided assertions also validate this behavior for different inputs. There are no logical errors or edge cases that would cause the function to fail under the given assumptions. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
