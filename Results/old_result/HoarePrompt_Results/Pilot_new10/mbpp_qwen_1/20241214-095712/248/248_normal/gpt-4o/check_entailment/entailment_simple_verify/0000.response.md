Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple. The annotations clearly show that the function takes a list as input and returns a tuple containing the same elements. The provided assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different lists. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
