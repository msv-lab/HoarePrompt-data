Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression inside the `sum` function to count how many times the condition `isinstance(x, int)` evaluates to `True`. This approach works for any list containing elements of various types, including integers, strings, and floats.

The examples provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected:
- `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` returns `2` because there are two integers (`1` and `2`).
- `func_1([1, 2, 3])` returns `3` because all three elements are integers.
- `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` returns `2` because only the first and third elements are integers.

Since the function handles all cases correctly based on the problem description and the provided examples, the program is correct.
