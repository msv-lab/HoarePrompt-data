Let's analyze the given annotated code step by step to understand the functionality of the function.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**:
   - `lst` is a list of elements.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The function uses a generator expression `(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)` to iterate over each element `x` in the list `lst`.
   - For each element `x`, it checks if `x` is an instance of the `int` class using `isinstance(x, int)`.
   - The result of `isinstance(x, int)` is either `True` or `False`.

3. **Generator Expression**:
   - The generator expression evaluates to a sequence of `True` and `False` values corresponding to each element in `lst`.

4. **Sum Function**:
   - The `sum()` function is used to add up all the `True` values in the sequence.
   - Since `True` is treated as `1` and `False` is treated as `0` in arithmetic operations, the sum effectively counts the number of integer elements in the list.

5. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the count of integer elements in the list `lst`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:

- The code and annotations align correctly without any missing logic or edge cases mentioned. The generator expression and the `sum()` function together ensure that only integer elements are counted, regardless of the presence of other types of elements in the list.

### Summary:

The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and returns the count of integer elements in the list.

### Final Summary:

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and returns the count of integer elements in the list.**
