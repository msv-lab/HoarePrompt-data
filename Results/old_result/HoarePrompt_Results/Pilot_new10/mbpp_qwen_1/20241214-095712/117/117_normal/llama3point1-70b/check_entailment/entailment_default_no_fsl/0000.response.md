Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to count the number of integer elements in the input list. This approach is correct because `isinstance(x, int)` will return `True` for each integer element and `False` for non-integer elements. Summing these boolean values effectively counts the number of `True` values, which corresponds to the number of integer elements in the list. This solution works for all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints.
