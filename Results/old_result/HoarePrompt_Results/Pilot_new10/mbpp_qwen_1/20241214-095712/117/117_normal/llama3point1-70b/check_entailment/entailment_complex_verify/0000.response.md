Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original program align with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the given list by using a generator expression within the `sum` function. The annotation accurately describes the behavior of the function, and there are no issues or edge cases mentioned that would render the original assessment inaccurate. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
