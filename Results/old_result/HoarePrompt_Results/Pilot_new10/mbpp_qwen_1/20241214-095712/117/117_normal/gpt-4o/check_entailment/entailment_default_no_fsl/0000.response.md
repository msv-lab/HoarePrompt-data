Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function `func_1` uses a generator expression within the `sum` function to iterate through the list and count how many elements are instances of the `int` class. The assertions provided in the problem description cover various scenarios, including a list with mixed types, a list with only integers, and a list with non-integer types. Since the code handles these cases correctly and the assertions pass, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described.
