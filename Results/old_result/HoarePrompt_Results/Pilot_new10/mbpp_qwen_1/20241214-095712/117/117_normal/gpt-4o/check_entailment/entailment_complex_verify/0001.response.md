Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of integer elements in a given list. The function iterates over the list and uses `isinstance(x, int)` to check if each element is an integer, summing up the count of such elements. The provided test cases also validate this behavior. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
