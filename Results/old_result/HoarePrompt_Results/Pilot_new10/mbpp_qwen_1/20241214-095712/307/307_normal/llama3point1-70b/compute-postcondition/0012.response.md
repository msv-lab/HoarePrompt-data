Let's break down the task step-by-step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop is `while True`, which means the loop will continue to execute indefinitely as long as there are no explicit exit conditions provided in the loop body.

2. **Determine the State at the End of the Previous Iteration**: 
   - `n` is a positive integer.
   - `idx` is 3.
   - `triangular_num` is 3.

3. **Understand the Loop Behavior**: Since the loop is `while True`, the only way to stop the loop is if an explicit condition within the loop body sets a flag or performs an operation that breaks out of the loop. However, based on the given information, there are no such conditions specified.

4. **Adjust the States**: Since the loop is `while True`, the loop will always execute again unless explicitly stopped. Therefore, no adjustments are needed to the states for the loop to execute one more time.

Given this reasoning, the states remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

**Final Answer:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 3**
