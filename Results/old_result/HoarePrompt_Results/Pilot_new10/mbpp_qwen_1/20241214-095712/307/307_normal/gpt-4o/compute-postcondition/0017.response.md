Let's analyze the loop step by step to determine the final output state.

### Initial State
- `n` is a positive integer.
- `k` is 1.

### Loop Code
```python
while True:
    triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
        return k
    k += 1
```

### Observations from Given Iterations
- After 1 iteration: `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and its length is not equal to `n`.
- After 2 iterations: `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 3, and its length is not equal to `n`.
- After 3 iterations: `k` is 4, `triangular_number` is 6, and its length is not equal to `n`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Loop Condition**: The loop continues indefinitely until the condition `len(str(triangular_number)) == n` is met.
2. **Triangular Number Calculation**: `triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2` computes the \(k\)-th triangular number.
3. **String Length Check**: The loop checks if the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` equals `n`.

### General Pattern
- For each iteration, `k` increases by 1.
- The triangular number increases in a specific pattern: 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, etc.
- The loop stops when the length of the string representation of the triangular number matches `n`.

### Final Output State

Since the loop continues until the length of the string representation of the triangular number matches `n`, we need to find the value of `k` that satisfies this condition. Let's denote the final value of `k` as `k_final`.

- When the loop exits, `k_final` is the smallest integer such that `len(str(k_final * (k_final + 1) // 2)) == n`.

Given that the loop eventually finds such a `k_final`, the final state will be:
- `k` is `k_final`.
- `triangular_number` is `k_final * (k_final + 1) // 2`.

### Conclusion

The output state after all iterations of the loop have executed is:
Output State: **`k` is the smallest integer such that the length of the string representation of the triangular number `k * (k + 1) // 2` is equal to `n`, and `triangular_number` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`.**
