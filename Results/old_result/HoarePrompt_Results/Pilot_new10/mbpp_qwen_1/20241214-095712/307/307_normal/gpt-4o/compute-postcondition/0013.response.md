The code updates the value of `triangular_number` to `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 3, the value of `triangular_number` will be calculated as `3 * (3 + 1) // 2`, which equals `6`. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 6**
