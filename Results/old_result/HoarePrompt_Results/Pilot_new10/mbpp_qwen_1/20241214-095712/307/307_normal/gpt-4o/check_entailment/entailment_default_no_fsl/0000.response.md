Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function iterates over values of `k` starting from 1, calculates the triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and checks if the length of the string representation of this triangular number equals `n`. If so, it returns the value of `k`. The assertions in the code also pass, which further confirms the correctness of the implementation for the given test cases. Since the code seems to handle the described problem for every potential case based on the provided information, the correctness is **True**.
