The code assigns the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2` to the variable `triangular_number`. Given that `k` is 1, the calculation becomes `1 * (1 + 1) // 2`, which simplifies to `1 * 2 // 2`, resulting in `1`. Therefore, `triangular_number` is assigned the value `1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `k` is 1; `triangular_number` is 1**
