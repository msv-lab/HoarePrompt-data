Since the `while True` loop runs indefinitely as long as the condition is true, the only thing that needs to be ensured is that the loop continues to run. Given that the loop is `while True`, no adjustments are needed to the program state because the loop will always execute as long as the program continues running.

Therefore, the state right before the loop does not need any modification.

State: **`n` is a positive integer; `k` is 1**
