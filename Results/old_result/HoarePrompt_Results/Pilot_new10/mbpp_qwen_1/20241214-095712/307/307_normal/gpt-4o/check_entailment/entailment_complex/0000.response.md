Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: The task is to write a function that finds the index `k` of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits.
   
2. **Function Implementation**:
   - The function starts with `k = 1`.
   - It enters an infinite loop (`while True`) to keep checking triangular numbers until the condition is met.
   - For each value of `k`, it calculates the triangular number using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
   - It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number equals `n`.
   - If the condition is met, it returns `k`.
   - Otherwise, it increments `k` and repeats the process.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The assertions provided (`assert func_1(2) == 4`, `assert func_1(3) == 14`, `assert func_1(4) == 45`) verify that the function works correctly for these specific cases. These examples confirm that the function finds the correct index for the smallest triangular number with the specified number of digits.

4. **Loop Termination**:
   - The loop will terminate when the smallest triangular number with `n` digits is found because the function returns `k` at that point. Since the triangular number grows monotonically with `k`, the loop guarantees that it will eventually find the correct `k`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The function handles all positive integers `n` correctly. As long as `n` is a positive integer, the function will find the correct `k`.

Therefore, the function correctly implements the required behavior according to the problem description.
