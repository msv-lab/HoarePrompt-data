Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The code iterates over possible indices `idx` starting from 1, calculates the corresponding triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, and checks if the length of the string representation of this triangular number is at least `n`. If it is, the function returns the current index `idx`. The loop continues until the condition is met, ensuring that the returned index corresponds to the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and output hints.
