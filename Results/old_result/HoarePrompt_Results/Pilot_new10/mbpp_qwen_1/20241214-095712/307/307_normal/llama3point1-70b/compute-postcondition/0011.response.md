The code increments the value of `idx` by 1. Given the initial state, `idx` was 2. After incrementing, `idx` becomes 3. The length of the string representation of `triangular_num` (which is "3") is 1, and since 1 is less than `n` (which is a positive integer), the condition to return `idx` is not met, and no changes occur to `n` or `triangular_num`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `idx` is 3, `triangular_num` is 3**
