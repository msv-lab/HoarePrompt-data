Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. It iterates through increasing values of `idx`, calculates the corresponding triangular number, and checks if its string representation has at least `n` digits. Once it finds such a triangular number, it returns the value of `idx`. This matches the problem description accurately for all potential cases.
