Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function iterates through natural numbers, calculates the corresponding triangular number using the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`, and checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`. It returns the index `idx` as soon as this condition is met. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for valid inputs, and there are no cases mentioned that the function does not handle correctly. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
