According to the code, the `while True` loop will continue executing indefinitely until the specified condition in the loop body is met. At the end of the last iteration, we know the following:

- `n` is a positive integer
- `k` is 2
- `triangular_number` is 1
- The length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`

For the loop to execute one more time, the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` must eventually become equal to `n`. Since the loop is `while True`, no further adjustments to the loop condition are needed beyond ensuring that the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` meets the required condition.

Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the condition related to the length of the string representation of `triangular_number`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` must be equal to `n`**
