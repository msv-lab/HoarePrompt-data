Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to correctly find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. The function iterates over values of `k` starting from 1 and calculates the corresponding triangular number using the formula \( \frac{k(k+1)}{2} \). It checks if the length of the string representation of the triangular number equals `n`. If it does, the function returns the current value of `k`.

To verify this, let's consider the mathematical properties of triangular numbers and the assertions provided:

1. For `n = 2`, the smallest triangular number with 2 digits is 10, which is the 4th triangular number (since \( T_4 = 10 \)). The function correctly returns 4.
2. For `n = 3`, the smallest triangular number with 3 digits is 120, which is the 14th triangular number (since \( T_{14} = 120 \)). The function correctly returns 14.
3. For `n = 4`, the smallest triangular number with 4 digits is 1035, which is the 45th triangular number (since \( T_{45} = 1035 \)). The function correctly returns 45.

The function handles the problem as described, and no counterexample has been found where the function does not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
