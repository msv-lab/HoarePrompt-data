You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks for only one pair of consecutive digits in the middle of the string representation of the number to determine if the number is undulating. An undulating number is defined as a number where the digits alternate in a specific pattern (e.g., 121212, 353535). However, the current implementation only checks one such pair and will return `True` for numbers that do not meet the full criteria for being undulating.

For example, consider the number `1234`. The function will check if `2 < 3` and `3 < 4`, which is true, but it will also check the condition for the next pair (`3 < 4` and `4 < 5`), which is not applicable since there is no digit after `4`. Since the loop only runs up to `len(n) - 2`, it will incorrectly return `True` for numbers like `1234`.

A correct implementation would need to ensure that the alternating pattern holds for the entire length of the number, including checking both possible patterns (increasing then decreasing or decreasing then increasing) for each pair of consecutive digits throughout the entire string.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a positive integer `n` represented as a string, and returns `True` if the string representation of `n` is undulating. An undulating string means that for every index `i` (1 <= i < len(n) - 1), either `n[i-1] < n[i] < n[i+1]` or `n[i-1] > n[i] > n[i+1]`. If the string does not satisfy this condition, the function returns `False`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
