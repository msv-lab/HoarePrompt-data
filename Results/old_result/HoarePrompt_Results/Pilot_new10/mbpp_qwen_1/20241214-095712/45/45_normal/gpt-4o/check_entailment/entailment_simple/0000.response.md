Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:

The given program correctly checks whether a given number is undulating or not based on the provided problem description. An undulating number is defined as a number that alternates between two digits, starting and ending with the first digit.

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Length Check**: The program first checks if the length of the string representation of the number (`s`) is less than 3. If so, it returns `False` because a number cannot be undulating if it has fewer than three digits.
2. **First Two Digits Check**: It then checks if the first two digits are the same. If they are, it returns `False` because an undulating number must alternate between two different digits.
3. **Alternating Digits Check**: The program uses a for loop to iterate through the rest of the digits, ensuring that each pair of adjacent digits alternates between `first_digit` and `second_digit`. If at any point this condition is violated, the function immediately returns `False`.

### Test Cases Verification:

- **Case 1**: `func_1(1212121)` - The number alternates between '1' and '2', so it returns `True`.
- **Case 2**: `func_1(1991)` - The number does not alternate consistently, so it returns `False`.
- **Case 3**: `func_1(121)` - The number alternates between '1' and '2', so it returns `True`.

Since the program correctly implements the logic to verify if a number is undulating and passes all the test cases, the program is correct. Therefore, the output is **True**.
