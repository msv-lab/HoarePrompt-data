Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the logic described in the original assessment. The function `func_1` correctly checks if the given number is undulating by ensuring it meets the criteria of having an alternating pattern of digits. The annotations confirm that the function returns `False` for numbers that do not meet these criteria and `True` for those that do. The original assessment correctly identified that the function works as intended based on the problem description.
