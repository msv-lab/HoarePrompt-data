Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine if a given number is undulating. The function converts the number to a string and checks if the length of the string is at least 3. It then ensures that the first two digits are different and iterates through the rest of the string, checking that the digits at even indices match the first digit and the digits at odd indices match the second digit. The provided test cases and the logic implemented in the function support the conclusion that the function works as expected. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
