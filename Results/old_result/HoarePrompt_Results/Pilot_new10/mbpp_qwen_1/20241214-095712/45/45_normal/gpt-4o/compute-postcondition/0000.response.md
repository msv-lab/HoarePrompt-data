`s` is assigned the value of `str(n)`, which converts the integer `n` to a string. The value of `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer; `s` is a string representation of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `s` is a string representation of `n`.**
