Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the logic for checking if a number is undulating. An undulating number is defined as a number that has an alternating pattern of two different digits. The code first checks if the length of the number is at least 3. It then ensures that the first and second digits are different. Finally, it iterates through the rest of the digits, ensuring that even-indexed digits match the first digit and odd-indexed digits match the second digit. The provided test cases also align with this logic:

- `func_1(1212121)` returns `True` because the digits alternate between 1 and 2.
- `func_1(1991)` returns `False` because the digits do not alternate properly.
- `func_1(121)` returns `True` because the digits alternate between 1 and 2.

Since the code and the provided assertions follow the problem description and the output hints, the program is correct.
