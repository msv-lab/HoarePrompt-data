The code `break` does not affect the values of the variables `n`, `i`, and `undulating`. It simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Therefore, the Output State remains the same as the Initial State.

Output State: **`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least 3 characters, `i` is 2, `undulating` is `False`**
