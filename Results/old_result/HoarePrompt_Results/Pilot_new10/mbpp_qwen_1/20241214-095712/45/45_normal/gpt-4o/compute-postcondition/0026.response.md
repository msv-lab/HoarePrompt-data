Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n` with a length of at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`, and the loop has executed for all valid `i` values such that `2 <= i < len(s)`. If any condition inside the loop evaluates to `False`, the function returns `False` at that point. Otherwise, the function returns `None`.**

### Explanation:
- **Initial State**: `n` is a positive integer, `s` is a string representation of `n`, the length of `s` is at least 3, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the second character of `s`, and `first_digit` is not equal to `second_digit`.
- **Loop Execution**: The loop iterates over characters in `s` starting from index 2 (inclusive) up to the length of `s` (exclusive). For each iteration:
  - If `i % 2 == 0` and `s[i]` is not equal to `first_digit`, the function returns `False`.
  - If `i % 2 == 1` and `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit`, the function returns `False`.

Since the loop checks every other character starting from index 2, it will check all valid indices in the string `s` under the given conditions. If no conditions evaluate to `False` during the entire loop execution, the function returns `None`.

Thus, the final state after the loop completes all its iterations (if it does) will be as described above.
