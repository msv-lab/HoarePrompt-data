Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly splits the input list `lst` into sublists every nth element as specified. The list comprehension `[lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]` generates the required sublists. For any given list and integer n, this function will produce the correct output without missing any logic or edge cases. Therefore, the function works as expected for all potential cases based on the problem description.
