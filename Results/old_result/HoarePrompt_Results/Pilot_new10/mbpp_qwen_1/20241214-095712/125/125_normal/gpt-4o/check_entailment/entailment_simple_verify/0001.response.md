Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` correctly splits the input list into sublists at every nth element, as demonstrated by the provided assertions. The annotations correctly describe the state of the program before and after the execution of the for loop, confirming that the function behaves as intended. Each sublist in the `result` list indeed contains every nth element from the original list `lst`, which aligns with the problem requirements. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
