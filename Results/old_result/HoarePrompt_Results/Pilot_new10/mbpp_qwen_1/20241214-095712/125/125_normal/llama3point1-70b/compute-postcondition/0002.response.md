Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of lists where each inner list contains every nth element starting from index i for i in range(n). This includes handling all potential cases where `n` is within the valid range (1 <= n <= len(lst)).**
