The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `n`, which is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(lst). The function returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains every nth element starting from index i for i in range(n).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list of lists containing every nth element starting from index i for i in range(n).
