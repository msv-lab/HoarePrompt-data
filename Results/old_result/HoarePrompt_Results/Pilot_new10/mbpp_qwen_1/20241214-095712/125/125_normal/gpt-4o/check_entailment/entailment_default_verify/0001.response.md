Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to split the input list into sublists at every nth element. The output hints confirm that the function creates sublists by distributing elements based on their index modulo \(n\), which matches the problem description. The assertions provided in the problem description validate the function across various cases, including different types of elements (strings and integers) and different values of \(n\). Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
