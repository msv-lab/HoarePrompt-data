Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` does not split the list into sublists where each sublist contains every \(n\)-th element, as required by the problem description. Instead, it groups elements by their index modulo \(n\). The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function appends elements to sublists based on their position modulo \(n\), which results in sublists containing elements at intervals of \(n\), not every \(n\)-th element. Therefore, the original assessment correctly identifies the discrepancy between the expected and actual behavior of the function.
