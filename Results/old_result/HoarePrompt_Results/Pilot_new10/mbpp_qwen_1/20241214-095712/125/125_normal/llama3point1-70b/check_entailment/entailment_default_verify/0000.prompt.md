You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not split the list for every nth element as described. Instead, it creates a list of slices where each slice starts from every position `i` (from 0 to `n-1`) and takes every `n`th element thereafter. This means that for `n=2`, it would produce two lists: one starting from index 0 and taking every second element, and another starting from index 1 and taking every second element. 

For example, given the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n=2`, the expected output according to the problem description would be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`. However, the provided function will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 5]]`.

To meet the problem description, the function should create sublists such that each sublist contains elements from the original list separated by `n-1` elements. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n-1)]
```

This version will correctly split the list into sublists, each starting from every nth element.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of lists where each inner list contains every nth element starting from index i for i in range(n). This includes handling all potential cases where `n` is within the valid range (1 <= n <= len(lst)). 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
