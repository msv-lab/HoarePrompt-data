Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a list (`lst`) and an integer (`n`), which matches the required input.

2. **Splitting Logic**: The program uses a list comprehension to create a list of `n` empty lists (`result = [[] for _ in range(n)]`). It then iterates over the elements of the input list using `enumerate`, appending each element to the corresponding sublist in `result` based on the index modulo `n` (`result[i % n].append(element)`). This ensures that every `n`-th element is placed into its respective sublist, effectively splitting the list as required.

3. **Correct Output Format**: After the loop, the function returns the list of sublists, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected for different inputs and values of `n`.

Given these points, the program consistently performs the task as specified in the problem description for any valid input list and integer `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.
