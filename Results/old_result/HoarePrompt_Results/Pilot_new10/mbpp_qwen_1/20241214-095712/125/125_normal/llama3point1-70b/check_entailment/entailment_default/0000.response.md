Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the code uses list slicing with the step parameter `n` to create sublists, but it does not correctly split the list for every nth element as required. Instead, it creates `n` sublists, where each sublist starts from an index `i` and includes every nth element thereafter. This approach does not ensure that every nth element is included in the resulting sublists.

For example, consider the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6]` and `n = 3`. The expected output would be `[[1, 4], [2, 5], [3, 6]]`. However, the provided code would produce `[[1, 4, 7, ...], [2, 5, 8, ...], [3, 6, 9, ...]]`, which is incorrect because it continues beyond the length of the list.

To correctly implement the function, you would need to ensure that the slicing stops at the end of the list. A corrected version of the function could be:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i:len(lst):n] for i in range(n)]
```

This ensures that each sublist ends at the last element of the original list, thereby correctly splitting the list every nth element.
