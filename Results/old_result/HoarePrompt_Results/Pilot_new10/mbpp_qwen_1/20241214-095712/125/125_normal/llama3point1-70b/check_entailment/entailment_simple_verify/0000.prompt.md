You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not split the list for every nth element as described. Instead, it creates a list of slices where each slice starts from every position `i` (from 0 to `n-1`) and takes every `n`th element thereafter. This means that for `n=2`, it would produce two lists: one starting from index 0 and taking every second element, and another starting from index 1 and taking every second element. 

For example, given the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n=2`, the expected output according to the problem description would be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`. However, the provided function will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 5]]`.

To meet the problem description, the function should create sublists such that each sublist contains elements from the original list separated by `n-1` elements. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n-1)]
```

This version will correctly split the list into sublists, each starting from every nth element.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list, and n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of lists, where each inner list contains every nth element starting from index i for i in range(n)


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
