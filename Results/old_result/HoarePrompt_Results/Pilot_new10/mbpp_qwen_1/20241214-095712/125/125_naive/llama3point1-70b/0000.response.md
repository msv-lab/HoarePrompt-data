Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program does not split the list for every nth element as described. Instead, it creates a list of slices where each slice starts from every position `i` (from 0 to `n-1`) and takes every `n`th element thereafter. This means that for `n=2`, it would produce two lists: one starting from index 0 and taking every second element, and another starting from index 1 and taking every second element. 

For example, given the list `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `n=2`, the expected output according to the problem description would be `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4]]`. However, the provided function will return `[[1, 3, 5], [2, 4, 5]]`.

To meet the problem description, the function should create sublists such that each sublist contains elements from the original list separated by `n-1` elements. Here is a corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n-1)]
```

This version will correctly split the list into sublists, each starting from every nth element.
