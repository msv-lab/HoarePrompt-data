Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The logic iterates through the list starting from index 1 (the second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`. The annotated version clearly describes the state of the program and the logic being followed, confirming that the function behaves as intended according to the problem description.
