Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers and returns `False` if any element at an odd index is even, otherwise it returns `True`.** 

This summary covers all potential cases:
- If any element at an odd index (1, 3, 5, ...) in `lst` is even, the function returns `False`.
- If all elements at odd indices are odd, the function returns `True`.

The annotations mention that the function returns `False` in three cases, which seems to be a simplification. The actual code checks each element at odd indices and returns `False` immediately if any such element is even, thus only one case is relevant for returning `False`. The function only returns `True` if no even numbers are found at odd indices.
