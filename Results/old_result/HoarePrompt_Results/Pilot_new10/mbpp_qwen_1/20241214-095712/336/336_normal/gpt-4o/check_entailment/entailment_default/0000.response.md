Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The function iterates through the list starting from index 1 (the second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, the function returns `True`.

Given the problem description and the assertions provided, the code appears to be correct. It correctly identifies whether all elements at odd indices are odd, and the provided test cases confirm its functionality:

1. For the list `[2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]`, the function returns `True` because all elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are odd.
2. For the list `[4, 1, 2]`, the function returns `True` because the element at index 1 (which is 1) is odd.
3. For the list `[1, 2, 3]`, the function returns `False` because the element at index 1 (which is 2) is even.

Since the code follows the problem description and handles all the provided test cases correctly, it is considered correct.
