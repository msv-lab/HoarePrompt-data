Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly checks whether every odd index in the given list `lst` contains an odd number. Here's why:

1. The function iterates over each index `i` of the list using a `for` loop.
2. For each index `i`, it checks if the index is odd (`i % 2 != 0`) and if the value at that index is even (`lst[i] % 2 == 0`).
3. If both conditions are met (an odd index with an even number), the function immediately returns `False`.
4. If no such condition is met throughout the entire list, the function returns `True`.

This approach ensures that the function adheres to the problem description, which states that the function should return `True` if no element at an odd index is even, and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the program is correct.
