Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to check whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number. Let's break down the logic:

1. The function iterates over the list starting from index 1 (the second element) and increments by 2, effectively checking only the odd indices.
2. For each element at an odd index, it checks if the element is even using the condition `if lst[i] % 2 == 0`. If any element is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`.
3. If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, the function returns `True`.

The assertions provided also validate different scenarios:
- `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True`: The elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, 7) are [1, 3, 7, 3], all of which are odd.
- `func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True`: The element at the odd index (1) is 1, which is odd.
- `func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False`: The element at the odd index (1) is 2, which is even.

Since the function correctly implements the logic to check the odd indices and return `False` if any of them are even, and `True` otherwise, it meets the problem description perfectly. Therefore, the correctness of the program is **True**.
