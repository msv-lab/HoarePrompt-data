Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should check whether every odd index in the given list contains an odd number.
2. **Program Logic**: 
   - The function `func_1` iterates over the list `lst` starting from index 1 (the second element) and increments by 2 to check every odd index.
   - For each odd index, it checks if the element at that index is even using `lst[i] % 2 == 0`.
   - If any element at an odd index is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any even number at an odd index, the function returns `True`.

Given this logic, the program correctly checks if every odd index in the list contains an odd number. It returns `True` if all such elements are odd and `False` otherwise. This matches the requirement specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
