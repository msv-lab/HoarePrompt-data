You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly checks whether every odd index contains an odd number in the given list. The logic iterates through the list starting from index 1 (the second element) with a step of 2, checking if each element at an odd index is odd. If any element at an odd index is found to be even, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any even numbers at odd indices, the function returns `True`.

Given the provided test cases:
1. `func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True` (Correct)
2. `func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True` (Correct, as the only odd index is 1, which is odd)
3. `func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False` (Correct, as index 1 is 2, which is even)

Since the function works correctly for the provided test cases and the logic appears to handle all relevant cases, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([2, 1, 4, 3, 6, 7, 6, 3]) == True
assert func_1([4, 1, 2]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(1, len(lst), 2):
        if lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, and the function returns True if all elements at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) in `lst` are odd numbers. If any element at an odd index is even, the function returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True if all elements at odd indices in lst are odd numbers, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of integers and returns `False` if any element at an odd index is even, otherwise it returns `True`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
