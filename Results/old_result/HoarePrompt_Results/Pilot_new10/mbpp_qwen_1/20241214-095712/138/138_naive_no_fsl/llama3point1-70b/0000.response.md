Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the described functionality. It searches for the given `element` in the `array`. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it catches the `ValueError` exception and returns a tuple with `False` and `-1`. This handles all potential cases as per the problem description, ensuring that the function behaves as expected in both scenarios.
