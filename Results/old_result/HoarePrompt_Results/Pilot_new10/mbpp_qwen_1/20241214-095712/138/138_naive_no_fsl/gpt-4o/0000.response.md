Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided `func_1` function appears to handle all cases correctly based on the problem description. It iterates through the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element. If the element is found, it returns `(True, index)`. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`. This logic matches the requirement to return a tuple with a boolean indicating whether the element is present and its index position or `-1` if not found.

The provided test cases cover some typical scenarios, and no edge cases were identified that the function does not handle correctly. Therefore, the function seems to be correct according to the problem description.
