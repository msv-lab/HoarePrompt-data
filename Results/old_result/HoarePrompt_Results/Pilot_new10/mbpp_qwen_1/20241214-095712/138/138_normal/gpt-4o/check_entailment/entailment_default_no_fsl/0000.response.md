Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements the function `func_1` which correctly searches for an element in an array and returns a tuple indicating whether the element is present and its index. The function iterates over the array using `enumerate` to get both the index and value of each element, and returns `(True, index)` if the element is found. If the element is not found, it returns `(False, -1)`. This matches the problem description exactly, and the provided test cases also confirm this behavior. There are no cases mentioned in the output hints or the problem description where the code fails to meet the requirements.
