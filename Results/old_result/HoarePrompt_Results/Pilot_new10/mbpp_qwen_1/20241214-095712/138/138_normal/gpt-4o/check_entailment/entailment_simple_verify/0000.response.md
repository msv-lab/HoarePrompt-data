Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function iterates through the array using `enumerate` to find the target element. If the element is found, it returns `(True, index)`; otherwise, it returns `(False, -1)`. The annotated states are consistent with the behavior of the function, and all provided test cases confirm the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
