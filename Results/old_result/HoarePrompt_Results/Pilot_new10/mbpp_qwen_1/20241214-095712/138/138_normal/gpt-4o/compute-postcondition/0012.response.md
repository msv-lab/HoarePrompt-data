The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of integers or other hashable elements, and `element`, which is a single integer or hashable element. The function returns either `True` and an index (0, 1, or 2) or `False` and `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and a single element `element`, and return `True` along with the index of `element` in `arr` if found at positions 0, 1, or 2; otherwise, it returns `False` and `-1`.
