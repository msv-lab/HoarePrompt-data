Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements a linear search through the array to find the specified element. It returns a tuple where the first element is a boolean indicating whether the element was found, and the second element is the index of the element if found, or -1 if not found. The function works correctly according to the problem description and handles all potential cases:

- It returns `(True, index)` if the element is found at any index.
- It returns `(False, -1)` if the element is not found in the array.

The provided assertions cover different scenarios including elements found at various indices and elements not found. The code logic matches the problem description and handles all potential cases appropriately.
