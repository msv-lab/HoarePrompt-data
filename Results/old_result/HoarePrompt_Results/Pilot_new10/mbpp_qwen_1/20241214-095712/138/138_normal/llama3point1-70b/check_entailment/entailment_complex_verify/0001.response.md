Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately reflects the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function correctly implements the specified functionality by returning a tuple indicating whether the element is present in the array and its index if found. The original assessment is accurate because the function handles both cases where the element is found or not found as described in the problem statement.
