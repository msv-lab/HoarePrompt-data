The code calculates the sum of the `rounded_numbers` list and assigns it to the variable `total_sum`. However, the initial values of `numbers` and `rounded_numbers` are not specified, so the exact value of `total_sum` cannot be determined. The output state includes the updated variable `total_sum` and retains the initial states of `numbers` and `rounded_numbers`.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of float or integer numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded values from `numbers`; `total_sum` is the sum of `rounded_numbers`**
