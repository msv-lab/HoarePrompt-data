Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It rounds each number in the input list, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. This logic matches the description and should work for every potential case, including edge cases like empty lists, lists with very large numbers, or lists with negative numbers. Since the function directly follows the requirements without any omissions or errors, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
