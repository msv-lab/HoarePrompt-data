Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. It rounds each number in the given list to the nearest integer, sums these rounded numbers, multiplies the sum by the length of the list, and returns the result. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works as expected for the given inputs:

- For the list `[22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]`, rounding each number gives `[22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18]`, and the sum is `48`. Multiplying by the length of the list (`9`) results in `432 / 9 = 48 * 9 = 243`.
- For the list `[5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]`, rounding each number gives `[5, 2, 9, 24, 29]`, and the sum is `71`. Multiplying by the length of the list (`5`) results in `71 * 5 = 355`.
- For the list `[25.0, 56.7, 89.2]`, rounding each number gives `[25, 57, 89]`, and the sum is `171`. Multiplying by the length of the list (`3`) results in `171 * 3 = 513`.

Since the function correctly performs the required operations for the provided examples and there are no logical errors or edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the code does not handle, the correctness of the program is **True**.
