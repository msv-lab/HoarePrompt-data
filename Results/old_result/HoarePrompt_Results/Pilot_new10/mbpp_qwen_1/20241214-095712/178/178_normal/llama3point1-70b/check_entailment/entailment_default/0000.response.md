Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to be correct according to the problem description. It takes a list of numbers, rounds each number to the nearest integer using a list comprehension, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the original list. The function returns this final value.

Given the problem description and the output hints, the code performs exactly as required. There are no obvious edge cases or examples that would cause the function to fail. For any list of numbers, the function will correctly round each number, compute the sum of these rounded numbers, and multiply this sum by the length of the input list. Thus, the function adheres to the problem description in all cases.
