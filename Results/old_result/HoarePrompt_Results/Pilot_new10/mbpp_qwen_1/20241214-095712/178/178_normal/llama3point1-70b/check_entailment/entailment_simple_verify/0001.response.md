Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers, rounds each number, sums them up, and then multiplies the total sum by the length of the list. This behavior is consistent with the problem description, which asks to round every number in the given list and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. The annotated code confirms that the program performs these steps correctly and handles valid inputs as expected. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
