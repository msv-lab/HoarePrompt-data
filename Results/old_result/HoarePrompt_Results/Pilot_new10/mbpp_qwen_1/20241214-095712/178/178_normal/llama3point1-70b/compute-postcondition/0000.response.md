The code creates a new list `rounded_numbers` where each element is the rounded value of the corresponding element in the original list `numbers`. Since the initial values of `numbers` are not specified, we will keep them as a list of floats or integers. After the execution of the code, the `numbers` list remains unchanged, and the `rounded_numbers` list is created.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of float or integer numbers; `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded values from `numbers`**
