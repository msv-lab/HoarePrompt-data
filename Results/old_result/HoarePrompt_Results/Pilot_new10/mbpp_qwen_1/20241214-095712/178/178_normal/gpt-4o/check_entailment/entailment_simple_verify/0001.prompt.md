You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]) == 243
assert func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]) == 345
assert func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2]) == 513

def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly rounds each number in the given list using the `round()` function, calculates the sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The function is tested with three different lists, and in all cases, it produces the correct output as per the problem description. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the function might fail based on the provided assertions. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for the given problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]) == 243
assert func_1([5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]) == 345
assert func_1([25.0, 56.7, 89.2]) == 513

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of floating-point or integer numbers.
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
    #`The program returns the result which is total_sum * len(numbers) where total_sum is the sum of all elements in rounded_numbers and len(numbers) is the length of the list numbers`


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
