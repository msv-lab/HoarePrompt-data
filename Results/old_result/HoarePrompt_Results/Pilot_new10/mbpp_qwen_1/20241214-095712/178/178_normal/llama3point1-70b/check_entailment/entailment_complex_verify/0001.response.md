Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately reflects the functionality of the program. The function `func_1` takes a list of numbers, rounds each number, calculates the sum of the rounded numbers, and returns the sum multiplied by the length of the list. This matches the problem description perfectly. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
