Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It rounds each number in the given list, calculates the total sum of these rounded numbers, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The output hints also correctly summarize the functionality of the function. Since the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and there are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause it to fail, the original assessment is accurate.
