Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` is the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element. `i` is the length of `nums` and the loop has executed for each valid `i` from 0 to len(`nums`) - 1.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over `i` from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.
- For each `i`, the loop checks all `j` from 0 to `i-1` (since `range(i)` generates numbers from 0 to `i-1`).
- If `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, then `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
- This process ensures that `dp[i]` contains the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` where each element divides the next element.
- After the loop completes, `dp` will have the required values for each index `i`.

Since the loop runs for all valid `i` and updates `dp` accordingly, the final state of `dp` will be as described above.
