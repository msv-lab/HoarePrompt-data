The code snippet updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, where `j` is some index. However, without knowing the specific values of `i` and `j`, or the initial values of `dp`, we cannot determine the exact updated value of `dp[i]`. We can only state that `dp[i]` is now the maximum of its original value and `dp[j] + 1`.

Given this, the output state is:
Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is incremented by 1, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its original value and `dp[j] + 1` for some index `j`.**
