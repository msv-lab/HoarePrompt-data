The code snippet `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for some `j` where `j < i`. This means that for each `i`, `dp[i]` is updated based on the maximum length of the subsequence ending at `j` (where `j < i`) plus one.

Given the initial state:
- `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
- `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element.
- `i` is equal to `len(nums)`.

The code snippet does not specify which `j` to use, but it implies that for each `i`, `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j` where `j < i`.

Since the exact values of `nums` and `dp` are not provided, we can only describe the general impact of the code on the `dp` list. Each `dp[i]` is updated based on the values of `dp[j]` for `j < i`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j` where `j < i`, and `i` is equal to `len(nums)`.**
