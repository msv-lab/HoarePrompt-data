Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers, and `nums` is not empty, and `nums` is sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[k]` (for `k` from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`) is the length of the longest subsequence ending at `nums[k]` such that each element in the subsequence divides the next element, `i` is `len(nums)`.**
