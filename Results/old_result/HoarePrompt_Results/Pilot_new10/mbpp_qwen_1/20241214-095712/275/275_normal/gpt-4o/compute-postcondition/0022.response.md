To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given information and the loop statement:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element.
   - `i` is equal to `len(nums)`.

2. **Loop Statement:**
   ```python
   for j in range(i):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Loop Execution Analysis:**
   - The loop runs from `j = 0` to `j = i-1`.
   - Given that `i` is initially set to `len(nums)`, the loop will not execute because the condition `j < i` will always be false when `i` starts as `len(nums)` (since `range(len(nums))` does not include `len(nums)` itself).

4. **Step-by-Step Reasoning:**
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decreased to allow `j` to take values from `0` to `i-1`.
   - Therefore, we need to decrease `i` by 1 to make the loop condition `j < i` true for at least one value of `j`.

5. **Updated States:**
   - Since `i` is initially set to `len(nums)`, we need to adjust it to `len(nums) - 1`.
   - The state of `nums` and `dp` should remain the same as they were at the end of the previous iteration.

6. **Final State:**
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element.
   - `i` is now equal to `len(nums) - 1`.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop is:

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element, and `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`**.
