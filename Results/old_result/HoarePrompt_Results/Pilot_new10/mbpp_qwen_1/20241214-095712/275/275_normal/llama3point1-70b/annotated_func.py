#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of positive integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of positive integers, and nums is not empty
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of positive integers, and `nums` is not empty, and `nums` is sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[k]` (for `k` from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`) is the length of the longest subsequence ending at `nums[k]` such that each element in the subsequence divides the next element, `i` is `len(nums)`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list `dp`, which represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at `nums[k]` such that each element in the subsequence divides the next element
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `nums` and returns either 0 or the length of the longest subsequence where each element divides the next element. If the input list `nums` is empty, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list and uses dynamic programming to find the longest subsequence where each element divides the next, then returns the length of this subsequence.
