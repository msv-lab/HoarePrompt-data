Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of positive integers and not empty and sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element is initially set to 1 except `dp[1]` which is 2, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1. If `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, then `dp[j]` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, the postcondition remains unchanged.***
