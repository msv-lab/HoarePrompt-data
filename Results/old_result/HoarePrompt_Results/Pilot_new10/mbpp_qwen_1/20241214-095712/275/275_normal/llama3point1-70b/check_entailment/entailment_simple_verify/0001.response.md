Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for finding the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The initial assessment correctly identified the key components of the function:

1. Base case handling: The function returns 0 when the input list is empty.
2. Sorting: The list is sorted to ensure that for each element `nums[i]`, we only consider previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`) for which `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.
3. Dynamic programming table initialization: The `dp` array is initialized to 1 for each element, indicating the minimum subset size for any element is 1.
4. Filling the DP table: The nested loops ensure that for each element `i`, we check all previous elements `j` to update `dp[i]` with the maximum value found such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.
5. Result calculation: The function returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

Given the annotations and the explanation, the original assessment of the function being correct is accurate.
