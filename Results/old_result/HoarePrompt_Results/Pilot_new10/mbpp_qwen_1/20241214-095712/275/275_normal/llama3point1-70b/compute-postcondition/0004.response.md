The code initializes a list `dp` with the length equal to the length of `nums`, where each element is set to 1. Since `nums` is a list of positive integers and is sorted in ascending order, the output state will reflect this, along with the new list `dp`.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers, and nums is not empty, and nums is sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`**
