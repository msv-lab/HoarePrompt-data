`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum value between `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`. The value of `i` is a positive integer plus 1, and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for some `j < i`. However, the specific values of `dp[i]`, `dp[j]`, and `nums` are not provided, so we cannot determine the exact new value of `dp[i]`. But we know that `dp[i]` will be updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.

Output State: **`i` is a positive integer plus 1, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]` for some `j < i`, and `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for some `j < i`.**
