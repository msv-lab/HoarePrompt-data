Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the logic required to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers where every pair is divisible. Specifically, the condition `if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` ensures that each element in the subset divides the next, but it does not ensure that each element in the subset is divisible by the previous element, which is necessary to satisfy the problem description.

For example, consider the list `[1, 2, 4, 8]`. The correct answer should be 4 because the entire list is a valid subset where each element divides the next. However, the provided code would only find the length of the longest increasing subsequence based on divisibility, which might miss this case. For instance, it might find `[1, 2, 4]` as the longest subset, but not `[1, 2, 4, 8]`.

To fix this, the inner loop should check divisibility in both directions, ensuring that both `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` and `nums[j] % nums[i] == 0` are satisfied for the subset to be valid.
