Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element, and `i` is equal to `len(nums)`. After all iterations of the loop, `dp[i-1]` contains the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where each element divides the next element.**

Explanation:
- The loop iterates over all indices `j` from `0` to `i-1`.
- For each `j`, it checks if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.
- If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
- After all iterations of the loop, `i` will be equal to `len(nums)`, and `dp[len(nums)-1]` will hold the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where each element divides the next element.

Thus, after all iterations of the loop, the final state is that `dp[i-1]` (which is `dp[len(nums)-1]`) will contain the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where each element divides the next element.
