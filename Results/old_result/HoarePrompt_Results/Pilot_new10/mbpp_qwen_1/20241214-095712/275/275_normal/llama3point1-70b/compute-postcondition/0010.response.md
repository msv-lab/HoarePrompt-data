Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration:**
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers and not empty and sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `j` is 0.

2. **Condition for the Loop:**
   - The loop iterates over `range(i)`, which means it runs from `0` to `i-1` (inclusive).

3. **Loop Body:**
   - The loop body is omitted, but we know that if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is set to 2. Otherwise, the postcondition remains the same as the precondition.

4. **Current Values Before the Loop:**
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - `j` is currently 0.

5. **Loop Execution:**
   - Since `i` is 1, the loop will run from `j = 0` to `j = 0` (inclusive), meaning it will only execute once.

6. **After the Loop:**
   - After the loop, `j` will be incremented by 1 (assuming the loop body does not change `j`).

7. **Updated States:**
   - `i` remains 1.
   - `j` becomes 1.

8. **Postcondition:**
   - The loop will check if `nums[1]` is divisible by `nums[0]` and update `dp[1]` accordingly.
   - The precondition remains the same as the postcondition after the loop.

9. **State Adjustment:**
   - The only state that changes is `j`, which is incremented to 1.
   - All other states remain the same.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop should be:

**`nums` is a list of positive integers and not empty and sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1.**

State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers and not empty and sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`, `i` is 1, and `j` is 1.**
