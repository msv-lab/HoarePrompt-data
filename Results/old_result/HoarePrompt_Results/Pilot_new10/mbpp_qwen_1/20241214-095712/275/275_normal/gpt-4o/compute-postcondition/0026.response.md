The code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `i` and `j` are both equal to `len(nums) - 1`, this means the value of `dp[len(nums) - 1]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[len(nums) - 1] + 1`. This results in `dp[len(nums) - 1]` being incremented by 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order; `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element; `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`; `j` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`; `dp[len(nums) - 1]` is incremented by 1.**
