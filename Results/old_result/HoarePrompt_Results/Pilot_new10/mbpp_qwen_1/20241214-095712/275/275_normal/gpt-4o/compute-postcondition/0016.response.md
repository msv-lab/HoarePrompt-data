Output State: **`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` is the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element, `i` is the length of `nums`.**

### Explanation:
1. **Initialization**:
   - `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order.
   - `dp` is a list of ones with the same length as `nums`.
   - `i` starts at 0.

2. **Loop Execution**:
   - The loop iterates over `j` from 0 to `i-1`.
   - For each `j`, the condition `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0` is checked.
   - If the condition is true, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.
   - This means that `dp[i]` is set to the maximum of its current value and the value of `dp[j] + 1`.

3. **Final State**:
   - After the loop completes, for each `i` from 0 to the length of `nums`:
     - `dp[i]` will hold the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element.
   - The variable `i` will be equal to the length of `nums` because the loop increments `i` until it reaches the end of the list.

4. **No Loop Execution**:
   - If the loop never executes (i.e., `i` never increases beyond 0), then `dp` remains as `[1, 1, ..., 1]` (a list of ones).

Thus, the final state after the loop executes all iterations is that `dp` contains the lengths of the longest subsequences meeting the divisibility condition, and `i` is the length of `nums`.
