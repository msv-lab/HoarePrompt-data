To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have finished, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and how it updates the `dp` array based on the conditions provided.

### Step-by-Step Analysis

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `i` starts from 0 and goes up to `len(nums)`.
   - For each `i`, `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`.
   - The loop checks if `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.
   - If the condition is true, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.

2. **First Iteration (i=0)**:
   - `j` ranges from 0 to 0.
   - The condition `nums[0] % nums[0] == 0` is always true.
   - Therefore, `dp[0]` is set to 1 (assuming `dp[0]` was initialized to 0).

3. **Second Iteration (i=1)**:
   - `j` ranges from 0 to 0.
   - The condition `nums[1] % nums[0] == 0` must be true for `dp[1]` to be updated.
   - If true, `dp[1]` is set to `max(dp[1], dp[0] + 1)`, which is `max(dp[1], 1)`.

4. **Third Iteration (i=2)**:
   - `j` ranges from 0 to 1.
   - The condition `nums[2] % nums[0] == 0` must be true for `dp[2]` to be updated.
   - If true, `dp[2]` is set to `max(dp[2], dp[0] + 1)`, which is `max(dp[2], 1)`.
   - The condition `nums[2] % nums[1] == 0` must also be true for `dp[2]` to be updated.
   - If true, `dp[2]` is set to `max(dp[2], dp[1] + 1)`.

5. **General Case**:
   - For any `i`, `j` ranges from 0 to `i-1`.
   - If `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`, `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)`.
   - This means `dp[i]` is the maximum length of the subsequence ending at `i` where each element divides the next element.

### Final Output State

After all iterations of the loop have finished, the `dp` array will contain the longest subsequence lengths for each index `i` such that each element in the subsequence divides the next element.

- `i` is a non-negative integer ranging from 0 to `len(nums) - 1`.
- `j` is an integer ranging from 0 to `i-1`.
- `nums[i]` is an integer in the list `nums`.
- `nums[j]` is an integer in the list `nums` such that `j < i`.
- `dp[i]` is the length of the longest subsequence ending at `i` where each element divides the next element.

### Output State:

Output State: **`i` is a non-negative integer ranging from 0 to len(nums) - 1, `j` is an integer ranging from 0 to `i-1`, `nums[i]` is an integer in the list nums, `nums[j]` is an integer in the list nums such that `j < i`, and `dp[i]` is the length of the longest subsequence ending at `i` where each element divides the next element.**
