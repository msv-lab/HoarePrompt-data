Postcondition: ***`i` is greater than 0, `j` is 1, `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[1] + 1)`***

Explanation: Since there is no else part, the postcondition directly follows from the if part. The if condition ensures that `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, and `dp[i]` is updated to `max(dp[i], dp[1] + 1)`. This condition holds true regardless of whether the if condition is met or not because there is no alternative case provided.
