Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code implements a dynamic programming solution to find the size of the largest subset where every pair is divisible. It handles the case where the input list is empty by returning 0. The code sorts the list and uses a DP array to keep track of the longest subsequence where each element divides the next. Given the problem description and the output hints, the code appears to correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases. The logic ensures that for each element in the sorted list, it checks all previous elements to find the longest subsequence where the current element is divisible by the previous element in the subsequence. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description.
