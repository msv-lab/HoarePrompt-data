Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, and `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1` for all `j` where `j < i` and `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. Since there is no else part, the final state of `dp` is determined solely by the if condition.***
