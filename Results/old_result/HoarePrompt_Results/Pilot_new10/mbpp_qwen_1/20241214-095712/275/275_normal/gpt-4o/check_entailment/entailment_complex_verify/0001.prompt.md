You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program seems to correctly implement the logic to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The dynamic programming approach used in `func_1` ensures that for each element, it checks all previous elements to see if they can form a valid subset with the current element. This approach handles the divisibility condition effectively.

Given the test cases:
- For `[1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]`, the output is `4`, which is correct as the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`.
- For `[10, 5, 3, 15, 20]`, the output is `3`, which is correct as the largest subset is `[5, 10, 20]`.
- For `[18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]`, the output is `4`, which is correct as the largest subset is `[1, 3, 6, 18]`.

Since the provided code handles these cases correctly and the logic appears sound for the described problem, the program is correct. There do not appear to be any edge cases or inputs that would cause this program to fail based on the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of positive integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of positive integers, and nums is not empty
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of positive integers sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list of integers where each `dp[i]` is the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` such that every element in the subsequence divides the next element, and `i` is the length of `nums`. After all iterations of the loop, `dp[-1]` (or `dp[len(nums)-1]`) contains the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where each element divides the next element.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value found in the list `dp`, which represents the length of the longest subsequence of `nums` where each element divides the next element
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `nums`. If `nums` is empty, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list and uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest subsequence where each element divides the next element, returning this length.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
