You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the base case where the input list `nums` is empty, returning 0.

2. **Sorting**: Sorting the list helps in ensuring that for each element `nums[i]`, we only consider previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`) for which `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. This ensures that we build up the dynamic programming table (`dp`) correctly.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized to 1 for each element, indicating that the minimum subset size for any element is 1 (the element itself).

4. **Filling DP Table**: The nested loops ensure that for each element `i`, we check all previous elements `j` to update `dp[i]` with the maximum value found such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

5. **Result Calculation**: Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

Given these points, the provided function should work correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no apparent edge cases or logical flaws in the implementation that would cause it to fail under any circumstances. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of positive integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: nums is a list of positive integers, and nums is not empty
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(1, len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of positive integers, and `nums` is not empty, and `nums` is sorted in ascending order, `dp` is a list where each element `dp[k]` (for `k` from `0` to `len(nums) - 1`) is the length of the longest subsequence ending at `nums[k]` such that each element in the subsequence divides the next element, `i` is `len(nums)`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum value in the list `dp`, which represents the length of the longest subsequence ending at `nums[k]` such that each element in the subsequence divides the next element


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
