Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the provided code and the output hints, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. The dynamic programming approach ensures that for each element, it checks all previous elements to form a valid subset, which satisfies the divisibility condition. The test cases provided also confirm the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
