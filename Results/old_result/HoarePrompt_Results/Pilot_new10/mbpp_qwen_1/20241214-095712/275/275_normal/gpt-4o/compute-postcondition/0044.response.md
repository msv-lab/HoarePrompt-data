The annotated code and the return postconditions provide insights into the behavior of the function. Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. **Initial Condition**: The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `nums`.

2. **Empty List Case**:
   - If `nums` is empty (`if (not nums)`), the function returns 0.
   - This means if `nums` is an empty list, the function immediately returns 0.

3. **Non-empty List Case**:
   - If `nums` is not empty, the function proceeds to sort the list in ascending order.
   - It initializes a list `dp` of the same length as `nums`, where each element is set to 1. `dp[i]` will eventually hold the length of the longest subsequence ending at index `i` where each element divides the next element.
   - The function then iterates through the list using two nested loops to update the `dp` list. For each element `nums[i]`, it checks all previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`). If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`.
   - Finally, the function returns the maximum value in the `dp` list, which represents the length of the longest subsequence where each element divides the next element.

4. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - The only explicit edge case mentioned is when `nums` is an empty list, resulting in a return value of 0.
   - There are no other explicit edge cases mentioned in the annotations, but we should consider that the list might contain duplicate values or very large values. However, the code itself handles these cases as long as the input is a list of positive integers.

5. **Missing Logic**:
   - The annotations mention that `dp` is updated based on divisibility, but the code does not explicitly handle cases where multiple `dp[j] + 1` values can be the maximum. The code takes the maximum value, ensuring that the longest subsequence is correctly identified.

Based on the analysis, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `nums`. If `nums` is empty, it returns 0. Otherwise, it sorts the list and uses dynamic programming to find the length of the longest subsequence where each element divides the next element, returning this length.**
