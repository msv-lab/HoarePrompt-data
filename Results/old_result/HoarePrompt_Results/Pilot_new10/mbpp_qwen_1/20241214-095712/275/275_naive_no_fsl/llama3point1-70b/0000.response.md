Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the logic for finding the size of the largest subset where every pair of elements is divisible. Here's a breakdown of why the code is correct:

1. **Base Case Handling**: The function correctly handles the base case where the input list `nums` is empty, returning 0.

2. **Sorting**: Sorting the list helps in ensuring that for each element `nums[i]`, we only consider previous elements `nums[j]` (where `j < i`) for which `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`. This ensures that we build up the dynamic programming table (`dp`) correctly.

3. **Dynamic Programming Table Initialization**: The `dp` array is initialized to 1 for each element, indicating that the minimum subset size for any element is 1 (the element itself).

4. **Filling DP Table**: The nested loops ensure that for each element `i`, we check all previous elements `j` to update `dp[i]` with the maximum value found such that `nums[i] % nums[j] == 0`.

5. **Result Calculation**: Finally, the function returns the maximum value from the `dp` array, which represents the size of the largest divisible subset.

Given these points, the provided function should work correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no apparent edge cases or logical flaws in the implementation that would cause it to fail under any circumstances. Therefore, the correctness is **True**.
