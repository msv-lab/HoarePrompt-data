Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find the smallest number in a list of integers. The function uses Python's built-in `min()` function to achieve this. The examples provided in the assertions demonstrate that the function works correctly for lists with multiple elements and lists with fewer elements. 

Since the function correctly finds the smallest number in any given list of integers (including edge cases like an empty list or a list with a single element), the program is correct.
