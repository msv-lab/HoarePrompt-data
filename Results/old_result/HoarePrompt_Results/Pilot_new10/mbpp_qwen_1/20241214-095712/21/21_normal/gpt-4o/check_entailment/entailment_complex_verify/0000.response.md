Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly uses the built-in `min` function to find and return the smallest number in the list. The provided test cases also validate that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. There are no apparent logical errors or issues with the program based on the problem description and the annotations.
