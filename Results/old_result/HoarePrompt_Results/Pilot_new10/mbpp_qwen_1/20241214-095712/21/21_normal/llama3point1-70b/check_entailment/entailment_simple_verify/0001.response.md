Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1(nums)` correctly uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. The original assessment is accurate because the function works as intended for non-empty lists of numbers, and the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list. Since the input is assumed to be valid, the function is considered correct based on the given assumptions.
