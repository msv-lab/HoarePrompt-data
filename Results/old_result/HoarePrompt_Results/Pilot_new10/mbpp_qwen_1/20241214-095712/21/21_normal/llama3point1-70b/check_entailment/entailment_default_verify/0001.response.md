Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1(nums)` correctly uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. The function works for all potential cases as long as the input is a non-empty list of numbers. Although the problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list, the original assessment correctly notes that the function is expected to work with non-empty lists, and thus it is considered correct within this scope. The output hints also confirm that the function accepts a list of integers and returns the minimum value, which aligns with the problem description.
