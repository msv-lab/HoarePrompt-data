Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly uses the `min` function to find the smallest number in the list `nums`. Given that `nums` is a list of integers as stated in the annotation, and assuming valid input, the function will return the correct result. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
