Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly uses the `min` function to find the smallest element in the list `lst`. The provided test cases in the assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected. There are no logical errors or edge cases that would cause the function to fail under the assumption of valid input. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
