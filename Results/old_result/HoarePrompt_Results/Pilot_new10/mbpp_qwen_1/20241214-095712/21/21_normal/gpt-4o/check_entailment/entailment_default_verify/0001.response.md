Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function is correct, but the output hints indicate that the function should handle the case where the list is empty. However, the provided function `func_1` using `min(lst)` will raise a `ValueError` if the list is empty because the `min()` function cannot determine the minimum value of an empty sequence. The output hints suggest that the function should return the smallest integer in the list, but this would imply handling the empty list case, which the current implementation does not do. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate as the function is not correctly handling all possible cases as described in the problem description and output hints.
