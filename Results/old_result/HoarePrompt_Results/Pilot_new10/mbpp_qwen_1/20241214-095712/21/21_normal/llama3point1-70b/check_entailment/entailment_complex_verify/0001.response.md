Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(nums)` correctly uses the built-in `min()` function to find and return the smallest number in the list `nums`. Given the assumption that the input will always be a valid non-empty list of numbers, the function will always return the correct result. The annotations also correctly describe the behavior of the function, confirming its correctness in meeting the problem description.
