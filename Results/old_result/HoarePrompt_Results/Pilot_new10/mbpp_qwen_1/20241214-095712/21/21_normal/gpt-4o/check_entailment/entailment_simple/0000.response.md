Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` is designed to find and return the smallest number in a list of integers. The function uses Python's built-in `min()` function to achieve this, which correctly identifies and returns the smallest element in the list. The provided assertions also validate that the function works correctly for different inputs:

1. `func_1([10, 20, 1, 45, 99])` should return `1`.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3])` should return `1`.
3. `func_1([45, 46, 50, 60])` should return `45`.

Since the function behaves as expected for these test cases and directly addresses the problem of finding the smallest number in a list, the program is correct according to the problem description.
