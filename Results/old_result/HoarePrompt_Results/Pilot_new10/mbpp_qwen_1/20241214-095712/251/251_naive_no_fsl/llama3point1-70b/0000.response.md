Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ). The function uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the radius `r`, which is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y). It also uses `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle `φ`, which is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point (x, y).

Given the problem description, this function will work correctly for all non-zero coordinates (x, y). However, since the problem does not explicitly exclude the case where (x, y) could be (0, 0), we should consider this special case. For (0, 0), `math.hypot(0, 0)` returns 0, and `math.atan2(0, 0)` is undefined. While `math.atan2` returns 0 when both arguments are zero, this still represents a valid polar coordinate (0, 0). Therefore, the function handles this edge case appropriately.

Since the function works correctly for all other cases and handles the edge case (0, 0) as well, the program is correct according to the problem description.
