Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, Ï†). The formula used for the radius \( r \) is \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is implemented using `math.hypot(x, y)`. The formula for the angle \( \phi \) is \( \arctan2(y, x) \), which correctly handles all quadrants and avoids division by zero issues. Since the function correctly implements the required conversion for all valid inputs (x, y), it meets the problem description for every potential case.
