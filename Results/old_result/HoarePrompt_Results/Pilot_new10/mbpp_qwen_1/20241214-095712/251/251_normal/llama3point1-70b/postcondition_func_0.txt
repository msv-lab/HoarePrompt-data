The function `func_1` accepts two real numbers `x` and `y`, representing rectangular coordinates. It returns the values `r` and `phi`, where `r` is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point `(x, y)`, and `phi` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point `(x, y)`.
