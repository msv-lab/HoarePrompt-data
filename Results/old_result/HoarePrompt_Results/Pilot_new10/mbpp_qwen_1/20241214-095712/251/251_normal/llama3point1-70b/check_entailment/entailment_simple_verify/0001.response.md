Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ). The function uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the radius `r`, which is the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y), and `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle `φ`, which is the angle between the positive x-axis and the line connecting the origin to the point (x, y). The annotations confirm that the function returns `r` and `phi` correctly for the given inputs. The original assessment was accurate as the function handles the general case and the edge case (0, 0) appropriately.
