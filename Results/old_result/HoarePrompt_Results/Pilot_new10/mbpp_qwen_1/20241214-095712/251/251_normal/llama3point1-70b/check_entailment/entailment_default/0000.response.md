Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts rectangular coordinates \((x, y)\) to polar coordinates \((r, \phi)\). The function uses `math.hypot(x, y)` to calculate the radial distance \(r\) from the origin to the point \((x, y)\), and `math.atan2(y, x)` to calculate the angle \(\phi\) in radians between the positive x-axis and the line segment connecting the origin to the point \((x, y)\). This implementation handles all potential cases, including negative values for \(x\) and \(y\), and accounts for the correct quadrant determination through the use of `math.atan2()`. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
