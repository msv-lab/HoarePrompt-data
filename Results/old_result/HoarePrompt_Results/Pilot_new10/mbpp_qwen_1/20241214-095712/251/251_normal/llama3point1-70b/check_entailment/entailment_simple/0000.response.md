Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular (Cartesian) coordinates to polar coordinates. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates. It then calculates the radius `r` using the formula \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \), which is equivalent to `math.hypot(x, y)`. The angle `phi` is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which gives the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point `(x, y)`.

The function returns both `r` and `phi`, which are the polar coordinates. This matches the problem description perfectly, as it requires converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates. The `math.hypot` function and `math.atan2` function handle all potential cases, including handling negative values and edge cases like when `x` or `y` is zero.

Since the program correctly performs the required conversion for any valid input, it meets the problem description in all cases.
