`theta` is assigned the value of `math.atan2(y, x)`, which calculates the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y). The values of `x` and `y` are unchanged, and `r` remains the Euclidean distance \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\).

Output State: **`x` is a real number representing the x-coordinate, `y` is a real number representing the y-coordinate, `r` is the Euclidean distance \(\sqrt{x^2 + y^2}\), `theta` is the angle in radians between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y)**
