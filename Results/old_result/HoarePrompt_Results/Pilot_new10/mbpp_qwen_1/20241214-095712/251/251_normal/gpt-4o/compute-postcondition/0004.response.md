The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`, which represent the rectangular coordinates of a point. It then calculates the Euclidean distance \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) and the angle in radians \( \theta \) between the positive x-axis and the point (x, y). The function returns these two values.

There are no apparent edge cases or missing logic in the provided code. The function correctly computes the Euclidean distance and the angle for any real numbers `x` and `y`.
