Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list in descending order, `n` is the original length of `arr`, `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in the final sorted list.**

### Explanation:
1. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The loop iterates over the sizes from `n` down to `1`.
   - For each size, it finds the index of the maximum element in the current subarray `arr[:size]`.
   - If the maximum element is not at the end of the subarray (`max_index != size - 1`), it reverses the subarray up to `max_index + 1`.
   - It also reverses the entire subarray `arr[:size]`.

2. **Effect of Reversing**:
   - Reversing a subarray `arr[:size]` ensures that the largest element found in that subarray moves towards the beginning of the array.
   - Over multiple iterations, this process gradually places the largest elements in their correct positions in a descending order.

3. **Final State Analysis**:
   - After the loop completes, `arr` will be sorted in descending order because each iteration ensures that the largest unsorted element moves to its correct position.
   - The variable `n` retains its original value as it is not modified within the loop.
   - The variable `max_index` holds the index of the maximum element in the final sorted list, as the loop processes the array to place the largest elements in descending order.

4. **Edge Case**:
   - If the loop does not execute (which would only happen if `n` is 0, making the array empty), the state remains unchanged: `arr` is an empty list, `n` is 0, and `max_index` is undefined or irrelevant as the array is empty.

Thus, the final state after the loop has completed all its iterations is that `arr` is a sorted list in descending order, with `n` retaining its original value and `max_index` indicating the position of the maximum element in the final sorted list.
