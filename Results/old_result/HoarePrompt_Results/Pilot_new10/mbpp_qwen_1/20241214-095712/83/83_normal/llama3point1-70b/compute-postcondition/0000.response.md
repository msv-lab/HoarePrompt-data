`n` is assigned the value of the length of `arr`. The length of `arr` is calculated and stored in `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the length of `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the length of `arr`**
