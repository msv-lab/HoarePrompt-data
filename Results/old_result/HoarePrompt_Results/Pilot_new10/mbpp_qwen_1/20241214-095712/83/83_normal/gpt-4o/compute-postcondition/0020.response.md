Let's analyze the annotated code step by step:

1. The function `func_1` takes a list `arr` as a parameter.
2. It initializes `n` to be the length of `arr`.
3. It iterates over `curr_size` from `n` to 2 (decreasing by 1 each time).
4. For each `curr_size`, it finds the index of the maximum element in the current subarray (`find_max_index(curr_size)`).
5. If the maximum element is not at the last position of the current subarray, it performs two flips: one to move the maximum element to the end of the current subarray and another to swap the last element of the current subarray with the first element.
6. After the loop, the array `arr` is sorted in non-decreasing order, and `curr_size` is 1.
7. The function returns the sorted array `arr`.

Now let's consider the return postconditions and ensure we cover all potential cases:

- The return postcondition states that the program returns the sorted list `arr` with its current size being 1. This implies that after the loop, the array is sorted, and the current size is reduced to 1.

However, we need to consider edge cases and the behavior of the function:

- If the array `arr` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop won't execute, and the array remains unchanged.
- If the array is already sorted, the loop will still run but won't perform any swaps because the maximum element will always be at the correct position.
- If the array has only one element, the loop won't run, and the array remains unchanged.

Given these considerations, the functionality of the function should cover all these cases.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and sorts it in non-decreasing order using a specific swapping mechanism. If the array has fewer than 2 elements, it returns the array as is. After processing, the array is sorted, and its size is reduced to 1.**
