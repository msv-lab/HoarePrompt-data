Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code does not correctly implement the sorting algorithm as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the function `func_1` uses a custom swapping mechanism involving the `flip` and `find_max_index` functions, but it does not consistently produce a sorted list for all possible inputs.

Let's consider the behavior of `func_1`:

1. **Initial State**: The function iterates over `curr_size` starting from `n` down to 2. For each `curr_size`, it finds the maximum element within the current subarray (`arr[0:curr_size]`) and swaps it with the last element of the current subarray.

2. **Example Analysis**:
   - Given the initial array `[15, 79, 25, 38, 69]`:
     - For `curr_size = 5`, the maximum element is 79 (at index 1), which is already at the last position, so no swap occurs.
     - For `curr_size = 4`, the maximum element is 69 (at index 4), which is already at the last position, so no swap occurs.
     - For `curr_size = 3`, the maximum element is 38 (at index 3), which is not at the last position, so it gets swapped with the last element (25), resulting in `[15, 79, 25, 38, 69]`.
     - For `curr_size = 2`, the maximum element is 79 (at index 1), which is already at the last position, so no swap occurs.
     - After the loop, the array remains `[15, 79, 25, 38, 69]`, which is not sorted.

From this analysis, we can see that the provided implementation does not guarantee a sorted list for all inputs. Therefore, the code does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Hence, the correctness is **False**.
