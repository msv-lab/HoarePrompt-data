The code assigns the index of the maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr` to `max_index`. Since `arr[:n-1]` was initially reversed, the new maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr` could be any of those elements, and its index is stored in `max_index`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with the subarray `arr[:n-1]` reversed; `n` is greater than 0; `max_index` is the index of the new maximum element in the first `n` elements of `arr`.**
