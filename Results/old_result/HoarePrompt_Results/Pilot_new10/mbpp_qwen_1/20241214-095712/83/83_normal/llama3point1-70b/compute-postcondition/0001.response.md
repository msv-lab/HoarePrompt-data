State before the loop starts: `arr` is a list of elements, `n` is the length of `arr`.

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The loop `for size in range(n, 0, -1):` will start with `size` equal to `n` and decrement by 1 until `size` becomes 0.

2. For the loop to execute at least once, the initial value of `size` (which is `n`) must be greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or less, the loop will not execute even once because the range function will generate no values.

3. The variable `size` starts as `n`, but we don't need to explicitly mention `size` in the state since its value is derived directly from `n`.

4. Since `n` is the length of `arr`, `arr` must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute at least once. If `arr` has fewer than 1 element, `n` would be 0, and the loop would not run.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute is that `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements, `n` must be greater than 0**
