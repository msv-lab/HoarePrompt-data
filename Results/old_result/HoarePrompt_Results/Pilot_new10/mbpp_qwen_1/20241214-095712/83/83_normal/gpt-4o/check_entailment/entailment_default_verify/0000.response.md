Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly points out that the provided code does not guarantee a fully sorted array for every potential case. The program attempts to sort the array by repeatedly finding the maximum element and swapping it to the end of the current subarray, but this approach is incomplete and can lead to incorrect results, as demonstrated by the example input `[1, 2, 3, 2, 1]`. The output hints do not contradict this assessment; they merely describe the functionality of the individual functions without addressing the overall correctness of the sorting logic. Therefore, the original assessment remains accurate.
