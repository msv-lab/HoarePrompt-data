You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sublists is a list of sublists (i.e., each element of sublists is a list).
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
    #The program returns a list of the first elements from each sublist in the list 'sublists'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `sublists`, which is a list of sublists. The code creates a new list where each element is the first element from each sublist in the input list `sublists`. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations, and the code directly returns the list comprehension without any additional conditions or errors.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

**The function accepts a list of sublists and returns a list containing the first element from each sublist.**
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
