Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It extracts the first element from each sublist and returns them in a new list. The code handles all the provided test cases correctly:

- For `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]])`, the output `[1, 3, 6]` is correct.
- For `func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]])`, the output `[1, 4]` is correct.
- For `func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]])`, the output `[9, 1]` is correct.

The code also handles cases where sublists are empty by simply returning `None` in those positions, which aligns with the provided output hints. Since the code works correctly for all tested cases and potential edge cases mentioned, the correctness is `True`.
