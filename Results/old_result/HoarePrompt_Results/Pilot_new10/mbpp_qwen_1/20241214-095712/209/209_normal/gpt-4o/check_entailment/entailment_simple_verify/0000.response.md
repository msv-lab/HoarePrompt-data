Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly extracts the first element from each sublist in the given list. The original assessment was accurate because the function handles the task correctly for any valid input list of sublists as described in the problem statement. The provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected. Therefore, there is no reason to change the original assessment.
