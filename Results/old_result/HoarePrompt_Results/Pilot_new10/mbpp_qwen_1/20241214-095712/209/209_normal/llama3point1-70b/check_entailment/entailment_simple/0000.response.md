Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. The function takes a list of sublists as input and returns a new list containing the first element from each sublist. 

Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

- The function iterates over each sublist in the input list using a list comprehension.
- For each sublist, it accesses the first element (`sublist[0]`).
- It collects these first elements into a new list and returns this list.

This behavior exactly matches the requirement to "get the first element of each sublist." The function will work correctly for any list of sublists, regardless of the number of sublists or their lengths (assuming they all have at least one element). Thus, the program is correct according to the given problem description.
