Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original problem description confirm that the function `func_1` correctly retrieves the first element of each sublist in the input list `sublists`. The function handles valid inputs as described and there are no issues or edge cases mentioned that would make the original assessment inaccurate. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
