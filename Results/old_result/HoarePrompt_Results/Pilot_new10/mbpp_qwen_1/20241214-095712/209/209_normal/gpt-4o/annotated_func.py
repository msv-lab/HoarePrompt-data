#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of sublists (i.e., a list where each element is also a list).
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #A list where each element is the first item from each sublist in the original list `lst`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of sublists. It returns a list where each element is the first item from each sublist in `lst`. If any sublist in `lst` is empty, the corresponding position in the returned list will contain `None`.
