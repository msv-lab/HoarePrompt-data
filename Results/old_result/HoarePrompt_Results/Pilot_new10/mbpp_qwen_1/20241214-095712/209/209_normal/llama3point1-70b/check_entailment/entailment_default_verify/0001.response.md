Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly retrieves the first element of each sublist in the input list `sublists`. The output hints confirm that the function processes each sublist and creates a new list containing the first elements of each sublist. Since the problem description does not specify any constraints beyond the input being a list of sublists, and the function handles these cases correctly, the original assessment is accurate.
