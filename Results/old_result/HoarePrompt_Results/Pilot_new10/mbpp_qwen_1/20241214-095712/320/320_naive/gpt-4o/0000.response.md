Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the second smallest number in the list. It first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and then sorts the resulting list. If the length of the unique sorted list is greater than 1, it returns the second element, which is the second smallest number. If the list has fewer than two unique elements, it returns `None`. This approach handles all edge cases such as duplicate values, negative numbers, and floating-point numbers as shown in the provided test cases. There does not seem to be any potential case where the program would fail based on the given problem description and examples.
