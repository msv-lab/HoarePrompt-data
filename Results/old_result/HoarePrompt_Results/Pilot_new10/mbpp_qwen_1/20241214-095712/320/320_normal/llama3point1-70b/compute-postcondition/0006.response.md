Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of integers with at least two distinct elements. It first removes duplicates and sorts the unique elements. If there are fewer than two unique elements, it returns `None`. Otherwise, it returns the second smallest element from the sorted list of unique elements.**
