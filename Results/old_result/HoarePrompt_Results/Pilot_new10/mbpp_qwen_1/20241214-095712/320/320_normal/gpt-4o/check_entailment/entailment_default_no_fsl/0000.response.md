Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly finds the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates using `set(nums)` and then sorting the unique numbers. It returns the second element of this sorted list if it exists, otherwise it returns `None`. This logic aligns with the problem description and handles all the provided test cases correctly:

1. For `[1, 2, -8, -2, 0, -2]`, the unique sorted list is `[-8, -2, 0, 1, 2]`, and the second smallest number is `-2`.
2. For `[1, 1, -0.5, 0, 2, -2, -2]`, the unique sorted list is `[-2, -0.5, 0, 1, 2]`, and the second smallest number is `-0.5`.
3. For `[2, 2]`, there is only one unique element, so it returns `None`.
4. For `[2, 2, 2]`, there is also only one unique element, so it returns `None`.

Since the code works correctly for all the given test cases and follows the problem description accurately, the correctness is `True`.
