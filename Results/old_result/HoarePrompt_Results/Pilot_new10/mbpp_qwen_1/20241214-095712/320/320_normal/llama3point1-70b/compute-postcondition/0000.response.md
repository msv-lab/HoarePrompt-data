The code `unique_nums = list(set(nums))` removes duplicates from the list `nums` and assigns the resulting list to `unique_nums`. Since `nums` initially contains at least two distinct elements, the set operation will remove any duplicate elements, and the list conversion will maintain the order of the unique elements as they appeared in `nums`.

Therefore, the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements (though possibly fewer now due to duplicates being removed); `unique_nums` is a list of the unique elements from `nums`, maintaining their original order.

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two distinct elements; `unique_nums` is a list of the unique elements from `nums`, maintaining their original order.**
