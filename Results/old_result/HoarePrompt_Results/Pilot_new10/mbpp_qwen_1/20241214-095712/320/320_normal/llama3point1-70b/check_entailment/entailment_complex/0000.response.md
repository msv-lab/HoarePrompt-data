Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of integers, ensuring it meets the requirement of having at least two distinct elements.
2. The function first converts the list to a set to remove any duplicate elements, then back to a list (`unique_nums`). This step ensures that all elements in `unique_nums` are distinct, adhering to the requirement of handling only unique elements.
3. The function checks if the length of `unique_nums` is less than 2. If so, it returns `None`, which aligns with the requirement to return `None` if there are fewer than two distinct elements.
4. If there are at least two distinct elements, the function sorts `unique_nums` and returns the second element in the sorted list, which is the second smallest number in the original list `nums`.

The program handles all cases as per the problem description:
- If there are fewer than two distinct elements, it correctly returns `None`.
- If there are two or more distinct elements, it correctly finds and returns the second smallest element.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description in all possible cases.
