Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in a list. It first removes duplicates by converting the list to a set and back to a list. Then it checks if there are fewer than two unique elements, returning `None` if so. Otherwise, it sorts the unique elements and returns the second element in the sorted list. This approach handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and output hints, ensuring the function works correctly for any list with at least two distinct elements.
