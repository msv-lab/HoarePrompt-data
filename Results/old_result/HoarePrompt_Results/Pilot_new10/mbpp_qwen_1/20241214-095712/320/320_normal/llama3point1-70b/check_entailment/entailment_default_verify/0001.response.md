Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly finds the second smallest number in a list by first removing duplicates and then sorting the unique numbers. The function handles all cases where there are fewer than two unique numbers by returning `None`. The output hints provided align with the problem description and the functionality of the code. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
