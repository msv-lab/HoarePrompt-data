Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description by calculating the phase angle (angle) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The test cases given in the assertions confirm that the function returns the correct angles for the specified complex numbers. The function takes the real and imaginary parts of a complex number as input and returns the corresponding phase angle, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Since the function works as expected for the provided test cases and the problem description, and there are no apparent edge cases or issues, the code is considered correct.
