Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. Inside the function, a complex number is created using these parameters, and then the phase angle (in radians) of this complex number is computed using the `cmath.phase` function from the `cmath` module. The phase angle is returned as the output of the function.

The problem description states that the function should get the angle of a complex number. In mathematics, the angle (or phase) of a complex number \( z = a + bi \) (where \( a \) is the real part and \( b \) is the imaginary part) is the angle \( \theta \) in the polar form \( z = r(\cos \theta + i \sin \theta) \), where \( r \) is the magnitude (or modulus) of the complex number. The function correctly computes this angle using the `cmath.phase` function, which is designed to return the phase angle of a complex number.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement for any valid input values of `real` and `imag`.
