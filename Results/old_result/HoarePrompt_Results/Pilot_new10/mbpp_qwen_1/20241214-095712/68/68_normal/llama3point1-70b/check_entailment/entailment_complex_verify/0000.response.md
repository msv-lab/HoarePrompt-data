Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts using the `cmath.phase` function. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, taking two floating-point numbers, creating a complex number, and returning its phase angle. The original assessment is accurate as the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
