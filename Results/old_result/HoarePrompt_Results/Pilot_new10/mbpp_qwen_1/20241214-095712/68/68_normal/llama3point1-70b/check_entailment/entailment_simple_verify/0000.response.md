Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original explanation both confirm that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts using the `cmath.phase` function. The annotations describe the state of the program accurately, showing that `real` and `imag` are used to create a complex number, and the phase angle of this complex number is returned. Since the `cmath.phase` function handles all necessary edge cases and the problem description only requires calculating the angle of a complex number, the original assessment is accurate.
