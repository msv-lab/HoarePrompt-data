Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The state of the program before the function call indicates that `real` and `imag` are valid floating-point numbers, which is appropriate for constructing a complex number. The function returns the phase angle of the complex number as expected. Since the function meets the requirements of the problem description and the annotated version confirms its correctness, the original assessment is accurate.
