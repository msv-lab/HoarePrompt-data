The code creates a complex number using the `real` and `imag` values. After executing the line `complex_number = complex(real, imag)`, the variable `complex_number` is assigned a new complex number with the real part being `real` and the imaginary part being `imag`. The values of `real` and `imag` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`real` is an integer or floating-point number, `imag` is an integer or floating-point number, `complex_number` is a complex number with real part `real` and imaginary part `imag`.**
