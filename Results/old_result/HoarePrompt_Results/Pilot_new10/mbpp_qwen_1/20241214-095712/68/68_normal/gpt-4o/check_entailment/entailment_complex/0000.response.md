Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. The function then creates a complex number using these parameters and returns its phase angle (in radians) using the `cmath.phase` function. 

The problem description states that the function should get the angle of a complex number, which is exactly what the function `func_1` does. The function correctly uses the `cmath.phase` method to compute the phase angle of the given complex number.

The provided assertions also validate the correctness of the function with specific test cases, confirming that the function behaves as expected for different inputs. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description in all cases.
