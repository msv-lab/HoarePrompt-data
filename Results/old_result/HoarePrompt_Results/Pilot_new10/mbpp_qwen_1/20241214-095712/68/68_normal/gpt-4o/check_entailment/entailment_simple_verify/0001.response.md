Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment appears to be accurate. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number using `cmath.phase`, and the provided test cases cover various scenarios (purely imaginary numbers with positive and negative imaginary parts, and a complex number with both real and imaginary parts). The annotations confirm that the function accepts real and imaginary parts as inputs and returns the phase angle as expected. Therefore, there is no evidence from the provided information that the original assessment of correctness being **True** is inaccurate.
