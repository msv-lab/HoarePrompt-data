Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly calculates the phase angle of a complex number using `cmath.phase`, which returns the angle in radians. The provided output hints confirm that the function accepts real and imaginary parts as parameters and returns the phase angle of the corresponding complex number. The test cases in the assertions cover various scenarios, including purely imaginary numbers and complex numbers with both real and imaginary parts, and the results match the expected values within the specified tolerance. Therefore, the function appears to be correct based on the problem description and the given test cases.
