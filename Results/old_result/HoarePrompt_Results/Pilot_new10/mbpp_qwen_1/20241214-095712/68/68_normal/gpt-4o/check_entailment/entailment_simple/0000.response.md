Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two arguments, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. It then creates a complex number using these values and returns its phase angle using the `cmath.phase` function.

The problem description requires a function to get the angle of a complex number. The function `func_1` in the program does exactly this by calculating the phase angle of the given complex number. The test cases provided in the annotations also confirm that the function returns the expected angles for the given inputs, within an acceptable tolerance.

Therefore, the program correctly meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
