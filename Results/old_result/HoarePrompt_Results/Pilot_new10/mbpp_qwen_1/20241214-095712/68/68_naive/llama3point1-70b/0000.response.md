Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly uses the `cmath.phase` function from the `cmath` module to calculate the phase angle (also known as the argument) of a complex number given its real and imaginary parts. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `real` and `imag`, constructs a complex number using these parameters, and then returns the phase angle of that complex number. Since the `cmath.phase` function handles all necessary edge cases (including zero and negative real/imaginary values), the provided program works correctly for all potential cases as per the problem description.
