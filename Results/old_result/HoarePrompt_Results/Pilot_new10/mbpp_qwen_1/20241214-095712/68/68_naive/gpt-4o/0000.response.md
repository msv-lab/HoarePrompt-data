Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the angle (phase) of a complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The examples given in the assertions verify the correctness of the function for different inputs:

- For the complex number `0 + 1j`, the angle is `1.5707963267948966` radians (which is π/2).
- For the complex number `2 + 1j`, the angle is approximately `0.4636476090008061` radians.
- For the complex number `0 + 2j`, the angle is again `1.5707963267948966` radians (which is π/2).

Since the function uses the correct mathematical approach and the provided test cases indicate that the function works as expected, the program is correct.
