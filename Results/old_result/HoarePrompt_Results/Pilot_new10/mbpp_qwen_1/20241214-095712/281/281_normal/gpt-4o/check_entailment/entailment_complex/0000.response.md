Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The list comprehension used in the function iterates over each number in the input list and includes it in the output list only if it is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs, ensuring its correctness according to the problem description.
