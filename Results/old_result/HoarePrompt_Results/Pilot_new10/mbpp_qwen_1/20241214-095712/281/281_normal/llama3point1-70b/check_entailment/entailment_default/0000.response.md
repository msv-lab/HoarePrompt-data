Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a list of numbers and returns a new list containing only the even numbers from the original list. The list comprehension iterates over each number in the input list and includes it in the output list only if it is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). There are no edge cases or specific inputs that would cause this code to fail based on the problem description and the output hints provided.
