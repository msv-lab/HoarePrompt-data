Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a list of even numbers. The list comprehension correctly filters out the even numbers using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. The annotations align with the functionality described in the problem statement, and there are no logical errors or edge cases not handled by the program. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
