Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find even numbers from a list of integers. The list comprehension iterates through each number in the input list `numbers` and includes it in the returned list only if it is even (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). The annotated code correctly describes the state of the program at various points, confirming that the function behaves as intended for valid input. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
