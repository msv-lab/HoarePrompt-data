Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from the input list using a list comprehension. The function checks each number in the input list and includes it in the result if it is divisible by 2 (i.e., `num % 2 == 0`). The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including lists with even numbers only, odd numbers only, and a mix of even and odd numbers. The function passes all these assertions, indicating that it works correctly for the given problem description and potential cases.
