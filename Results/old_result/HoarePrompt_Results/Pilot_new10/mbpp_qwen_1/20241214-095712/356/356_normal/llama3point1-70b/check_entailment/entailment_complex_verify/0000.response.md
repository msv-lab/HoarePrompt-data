Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function takes a string `input_str` and returns it with all spaces removed. There are no issues with the program based on the given assumptions and problem requirements, so the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
