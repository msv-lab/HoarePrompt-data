Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string. The output hints also confirm that the function accepts a string and returns the same string with all spaces removed. There are no edge cases or examples provided in the hints that suggest the function fails to meet the requirements under any circumstances. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
