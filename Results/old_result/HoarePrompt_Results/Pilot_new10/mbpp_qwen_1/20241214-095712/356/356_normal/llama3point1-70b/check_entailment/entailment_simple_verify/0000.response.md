Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. The annotated version confirms that the function operates as intended, returning the input string without any spaces. There are no edge cases or examples provided that would indicate the function fails to meet the requirements under valid input conditions. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate.
