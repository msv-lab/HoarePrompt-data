Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes all whitespaces from the input string using the `replace` method. This method will replace all occurrences of the specified space character (' ') with an empty string, effectively removing them. Since the function works as expected for any string input, there are no edge cases or examples where the program fails to meet the requirements. Therefore, the function is correct.
