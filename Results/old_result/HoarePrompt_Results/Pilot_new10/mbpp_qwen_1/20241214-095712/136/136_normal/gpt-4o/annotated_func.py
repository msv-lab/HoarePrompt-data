#State of the program right berfore the function call: d is a dictionary where the values are comparable (e.g., integers, floats), and n is an integer or float.
def func_1(d, n):
    return {k: v for k, v in d.items() if v >= n}
    #A dictionary where each key-value pair includes only those pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a dictionary `d` and a comparable value `n`, and returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This holds true for all potential cases, including dictionaries with non-comparable values for `n`, and considering that `n` can be any type that supports comparison (e.g., integers, floats).
