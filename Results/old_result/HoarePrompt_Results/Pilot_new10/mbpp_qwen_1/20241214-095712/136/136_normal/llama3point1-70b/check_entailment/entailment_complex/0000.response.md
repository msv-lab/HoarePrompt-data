Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(d, n)` takes a dictionary `d` and an integer `n` as inputs. It then returns a new dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. This is exactly what the problem description requires. The dictionary comprehension used in the function ensures that only the key-value pairs meeting the condition `v >= n` are included in the returned dictionary. This logic will hold true for any input dictionary `d` and any integer `n`, thus ensuring the program's correctness for all potential cases.
