Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1(d, n)` correctly filters the dictionary `d` to only include entries where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with the desired key-value pairs, which aligns with the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected for valid inputs, and there is no indication that the function fails for any potential cases within the given constraints.
