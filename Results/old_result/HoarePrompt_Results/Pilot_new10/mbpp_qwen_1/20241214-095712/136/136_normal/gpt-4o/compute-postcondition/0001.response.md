The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `d`, which is a dictionary where the values are comparable (e.g., integers, floats), and `n`, which is an integer or float. The function returns a dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `d` and a comparable value `n`, and returns a dictionary containing only the key-value pairs from `d` where the value is greater than or equal to `n`.**
