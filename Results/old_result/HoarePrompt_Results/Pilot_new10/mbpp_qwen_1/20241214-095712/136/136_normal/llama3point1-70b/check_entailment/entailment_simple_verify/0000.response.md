Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly filters the dictionary to only include entries where the value is greater than or equal to `n`. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary with the appropriate key-value pairs based on the given condition. The annotations align with the function's behavior and there are no issues or edge cases mentioned that would invalidate the original assessment.
