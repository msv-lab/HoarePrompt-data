Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians by multiplying the input degrees by `math.pi / 180`. The test cases (90, 60, and 120 degrees) match the expected outputs, confirming the correctness of the function. The output hints also correctly describe the functionality of the function, and there are no indications that the program fails to meet the problem description under any potential cases.
