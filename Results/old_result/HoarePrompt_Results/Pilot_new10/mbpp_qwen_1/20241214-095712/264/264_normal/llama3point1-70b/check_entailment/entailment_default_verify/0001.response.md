Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The output hints confirm that the function accepts a float or integer representing degrees and returns the equivalent value in radians. Given the problem description and the provided code, the function works correctly for any valid input as per the mathematical definition of converting degrees to radians.
