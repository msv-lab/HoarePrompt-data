Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original program clearly implement the conversion from degrees to radians using the correct formula. The function `func_1` takes a degree value (which can be an integer or float) as input and returns the corresponding radian value, which is consistent with the problem description. The original assessment was accurate as there are no issues or edge cases identified in the provided code that would make the function incorrect for the given task.
