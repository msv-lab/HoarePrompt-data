Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` converts an angle from degrees to radians by multiplying the input angle by Ï€/180, which is the correct formula for converting degrees to radians. The function consistently applies this conversion formula for any input value, as demonstrated by the test cases provided. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
