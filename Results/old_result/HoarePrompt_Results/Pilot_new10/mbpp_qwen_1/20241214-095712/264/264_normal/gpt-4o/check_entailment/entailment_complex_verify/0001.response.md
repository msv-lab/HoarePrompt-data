Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly converts degrees to radians by multiplying the input degrees by `math.pi / 180`. The provided test cases (90, 60, and 120 degrees) match the expected outputs, which are accurate conversions using the mathematical constant Ï€. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
