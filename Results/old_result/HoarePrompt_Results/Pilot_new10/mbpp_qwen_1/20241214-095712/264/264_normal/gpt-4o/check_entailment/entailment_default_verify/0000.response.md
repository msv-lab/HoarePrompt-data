Final: **True**

Reason: The provided program correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The function `func_1` passes the given assertions, and there is no apparent logic error or edge case that would cause it to fail for any valid input. The output hints also align with the functionality of the program, confirming that it accurately converts degrees to radians. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
