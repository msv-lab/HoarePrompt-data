Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the conversion from degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The output hints confirm that the function accepts a float or integer representing degrees and returns the equivalent value in radians. Since the problem description only requires converting degrees to radians and the function does this accurately without any issues for valid inputs, the original assessment of correctness being True is valid.
