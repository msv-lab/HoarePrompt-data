State before the loop starts: `num` is an integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `num`; `num_len` is the length of `num_str`; `sum` is 0

Now, let's think step by step:

1. The for loop iterates over each character in `num_str`.
2. For the loop to execute, `num_str` must contain at least one character because the loop body processes each digit (character) in the string.
3. The variable `digit` will take on each character in `num_str` during each iteration of the loop.

To ensure the loop can execute, `num_str` must have at least one character. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect this condition.

State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, `sum` is 0**
