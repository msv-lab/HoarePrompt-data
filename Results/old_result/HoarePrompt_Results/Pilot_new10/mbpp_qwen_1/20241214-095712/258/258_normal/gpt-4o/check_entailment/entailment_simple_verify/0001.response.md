Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to check if a number is an Armstrong number. The function converts the number to a string to iterate over each digit, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and checks if this sum is equal to the original number. The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
