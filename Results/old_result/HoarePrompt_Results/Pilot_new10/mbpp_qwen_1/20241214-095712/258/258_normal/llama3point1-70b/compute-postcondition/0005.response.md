According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digit`, which is each character in `num_str`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str`, and `sum` is the cumulative sum of the digits of `num_str`.

Since the loop iterates over each character in `num_str`, the loop will continue as long as there are characters left in `num_str`. At the end of the last iteration, `num_str` must have at least one character, and since we are processing one character per iteration, `num_str` should now have one less character.

Here's the updated state:

- `num` remains the same (unchanged).
- `num_str` will now be `num_str` without the last character.
- `num_len` will be reduced by 1.
- `sum` will remain the same (unchanged).

Therefore, the updated state at the start of the next iteration is:
State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1, `sum` is the cumulative sum of the digits of `num_str`**
