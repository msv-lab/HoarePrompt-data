Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number). An Armstrong number is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. The code correctly converts the number to a string, calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits, and compares this sum to the original number. The code handles all potential cases correctly based on the problem description and the provided output hints.
