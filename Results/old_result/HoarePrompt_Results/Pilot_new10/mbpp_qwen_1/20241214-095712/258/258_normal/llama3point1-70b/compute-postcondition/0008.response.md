Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. The initial state is:
   - `num` is an integer
   - `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least one character
   - `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1
   - `sum` is the cumulative sum of the digits of `num_str` without the current digit raised to the power of the new `num_len`

2. The code snippet is:
   ```python
   sum += int(digit) ** num_len
   ```

3. This line increments `sum` by the value of the current digit (converted to an integer) raised to the power of `num_len`.

4. Since the exact value of `digit` and `num_len` are not specified, we know that `sum` is updated accordingly. The variable `num` remains unchanged, as well as `num_str` and `num_len`.

5. Therefore, the only updated variable is `sum`, which now includes the contribution from the current digit.

Output State: **`num` is an integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num` that must have at least one character, `num_len` is the length of `num_str` minus 1, `sum` is the cumulative sum of the digits of `num_str` without the current digit raised to the power of the new `num_len` + int(digit) ** num_len**
