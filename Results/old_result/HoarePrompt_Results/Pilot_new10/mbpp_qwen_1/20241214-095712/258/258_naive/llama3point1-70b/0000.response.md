Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program checks if a number is an Armstrong number, but it does not correctly implement the logic for Armstrong numbers. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

The current implementation calculates the sum of the digits raised to the power of the length of the string representation of the number, but it does not correctly handle the number of digits. The variable `num_len` should be the number of digits in the number, not the length of its string representation. 

For instance, consider the number 1634:
- The correct calculation should be \(1^4 + 6^4 + 3^4 + 4^4\).
- However, the program incorrectly calculates \(1^1 + 6^1 + 3^1 + 4^1\).

To fix this, the code should calculate the power using the actual number of digits, which can be obtained by converting the number to a string and getting its length:

```python
def is_armstrong(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num
```

This corrected version will correctly identify Armstrong numbers.
