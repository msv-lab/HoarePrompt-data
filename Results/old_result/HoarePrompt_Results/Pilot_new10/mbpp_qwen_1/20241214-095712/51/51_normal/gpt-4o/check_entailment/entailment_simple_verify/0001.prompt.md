You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to multiply all the numbers in a list and divide with the length of the list.
Program:
```
import math

assert math.isclose(func_1((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((-10, -20, -30)), -2000.0, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((19, 15, 18)), 1710.0, rel_tol=0.001)

def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to meet the problem description. It multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. The assertions provided also seem to validate the function for different scenarios:

1. The first assertion checks a list with both positive and negative numbers.
2. The second assertion checks a list with negative numbers only.
3. The third assertion checks a list with positive numbers only.

Since the function behaves as expected in these cases and there are no obvious edge cases or logical flaws identified, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert math.isclose(func_1((8, 2, 3, -1, 7)), -67.2, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((-10, -20, -30)), -2000.0, rel_tol=0.001)
assert math.isclose(func_1((19, 15, 18)), 1710.0, rel_tol=0.001)

import math

#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `product` is the product of all integers in `numbers`, `numbers` is an empty list.
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns None since `result` is not defined and no value is explicitly returned or calculated


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
