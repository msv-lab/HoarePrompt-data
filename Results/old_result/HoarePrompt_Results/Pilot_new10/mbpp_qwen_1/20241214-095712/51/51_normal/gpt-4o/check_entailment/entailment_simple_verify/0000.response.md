Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is not accurate because the annotated version reveals a critical issue in the program. Specifically, after the for loop, the variable `numbers` is an empty list, which leads to an incorrect calculation of `result`. The correct `result` should be calculated using the `product` variable, not `numbers`. Additionally, the program returns `None` because `result` is not defined or returned properly. The correct implementation should be:

```python
import math

def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
```

This corrected version ensures that the product of all numbers in the list is divided by the length of the list, as required by the problem description.
