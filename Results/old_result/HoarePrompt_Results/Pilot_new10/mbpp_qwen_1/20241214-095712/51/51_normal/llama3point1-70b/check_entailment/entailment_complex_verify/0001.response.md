Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and then divides the product by the length of the list. This matches the problem description for any input list of numbers. The annotations describe the state of the variables at different points in the program, which align with the expected behavior of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
