The code `product *= num` multiplies the current value of `product` by `num`. Given that the initial state is `numbers` is a list of integers or floating-point numbers with at least two elements, `product` is the product of the first and second elements of `numbers`, and `num` is the third element in the list, we can proceed as follows:

- Initially, `product` is equal to `numbers[0] * numbers[1]`.
- `num` is equal to `numbers[2]`.

After executing `product *= num`, the new value of `product` will be `numbers[0] * numbers[1] * numbers[2]`.

The states of the other variables (`numbers` and `num`) are not affected.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of integers or floating-point numbers that must have at least two elements, `product` is `numbers[0] * numbers[1] * numbers[2]`, and `num` is the third element in the list**.
