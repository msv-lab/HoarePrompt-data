Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly multiplies all the numbers in the list and divides the product by the length of the list. The examples given in the problem description confirm that the function works as expected for different inputs:

1. `func_1((8, 2, 3, -1, 7))` returns `-67.2`, which is calculated as `(8 * 2 * 3 * -1 * 7) / 5 = -67.2`.
2. `func_1((-10, -20, -30))` returns `-2000.0`, which is calculated as `(-10 * -20 * -30) / 3 = -2000.0`.
3. `func_1((19, 15, 18))` returns `1710.0`, which is calculated as `(19 * 15 * 18) / 3 = 1710.0`.

The function handles both positive and negative numbers and works correctly for lists of varying lengths. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to meet the problem description.
