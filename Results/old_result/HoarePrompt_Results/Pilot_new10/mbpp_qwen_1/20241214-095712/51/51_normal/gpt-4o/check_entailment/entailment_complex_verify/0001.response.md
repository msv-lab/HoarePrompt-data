Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is correct based on the problem description. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it becomes clear that there is an issue with the function implementation. Specifically, after the `for` loop, the `numbers` list is assumed to be empty, which leads to a division by its length (which is non-zero). This means that the `result` calculation should not involve the length of the `numbers` list anymore because it has already been modified during the iteration.

Here is the corrected reasoning based on the annotated version:

1. The function initializes `product` to 1.
2. It iterates over each number in the list, multiplying `product` by each number.
3. After the loop, `product` contains the product of all numbers in the list.
4. The `result` is calculated as `product / len(numbers)`, but `numbers` is now an empty list, which causes the division to be undefined.

Therefore, the function does not correctly implement the intended logic of multiplying all numbers in the list and then dividing by the length of the list. The correct approach would be to use the length of the original list before the loop, not after.
