Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` meets the problem description. However, based on the provided output hints, it appears that the function actually returns `None` instead of the expected numerical result. The problem description requires the function to multiply all the numbers in a list and then divide the product by the length of the list, returning a numerical value. Since the function is returning `None`, it does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate.
