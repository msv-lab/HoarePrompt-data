Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should multiply all the numbers in a list and then divide the product by the length of the list. However, the code provided contains several issues:

1. **Type Mismatch**: The function `func_1` is defined to accept a tuple (`numbers = (8, 2, 3, -1, 7)`), but the problem description implies that the input should be a list. Tuples and lists are different types in Python, and operations like `len()` and iteration are generally performed on lists.

2. **Division by Zero**: The code includes a division by `len(numbers)`, which will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` if the input list is empty. The problem description does not specify how to handle an empty list, but typically, the function should return 0 in such cases.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns `None` because there is no explicit `return` statement for non-empty lists. It should return the computed result.

To fix these issues and make the program correct, the following changes are needed:

- Change the function parameter from a tuple to a list.
- Handle the case of an empty list by returning 0.
- Ensure the function returns the correct result.

Here's the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(numbers):
    if not numbers:
        return 0
    
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    result = product / len(numbers)
    return result
```

With these corrections, the function will correctly multiply all the numbers in the list and divide the product by the length of the list, handling both non-empty and empty lists appropriately.
