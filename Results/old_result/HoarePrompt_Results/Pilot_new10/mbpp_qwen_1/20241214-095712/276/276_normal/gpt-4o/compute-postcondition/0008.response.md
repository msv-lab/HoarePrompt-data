The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `n`. Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of integers with the same size `n`, and `n` is a positive integer. The function returns the median of the merged list, which is calculated as follows: if the length of the merged list is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements (`(merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2`), where `mid` is `n`; if the length of the merged list is odd, the median is the middle element (`merged_list[mid]`).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of equal size `n`, merge them, and return the median of the merged list based on the given conditions.
