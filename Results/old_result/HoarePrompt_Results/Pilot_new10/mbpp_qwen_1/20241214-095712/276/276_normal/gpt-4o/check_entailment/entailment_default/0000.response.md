Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. It merges the two lists into a single sorted list and then calculates the median based on whether the total number of elements is odd or even. The test cases given also confirm that the function works as expected for different scenarios. The merging and sorting process ensures that the resulting list is correctly ordered, and the median calculation handles both odd and even lengths appropriately. Therefore, the code follows the problem description for every potential case.
