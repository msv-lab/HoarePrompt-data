You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
Program:
```
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    return median


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both lists are empty. In such a scenario, the function will attempt to concatenate and sort two empty lists, which results in an empty `merged_list`. When calculating the middle index, it will still try to access indices that do not exist, leading to an error. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where one of the lists is empty and the other is not, which could also lead to incorrect results or errors.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (size), and size is a positive integer.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`merged_list` is a sorted list of integers formed by merging and sorting `list1` and `list2`; `list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (`size`), and `size` is a positive integer; `middle_index` is `size - 1`. If `size` is even, `median` is the average of `merged_list[size - 1]` and `merged_list[size]`. If `size` is odd, `median` is the element at index `size - 1` in `merged_list`.
    return median
    #`The program returns the median of the merged_list, which is the average of merged_list[size - 1] and merged_list[size] if size is even, or the element at index size - 1 if size is odd`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size and a positive integer `size`, and returns the median of the merged and sorted list. Specifically, if `size` is even, it returns the average of the elements at indices `size - 1` and `size` in the merged list. If `size` is odd, it returns the element at index `size - 1` in the merged list.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
