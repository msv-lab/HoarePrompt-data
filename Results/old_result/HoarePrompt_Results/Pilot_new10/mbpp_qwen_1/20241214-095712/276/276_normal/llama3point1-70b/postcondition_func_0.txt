The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size and a positive integer `size`, and returns the median of the merged and sorted list. Specifically, if `size` is even, it returns the average of the elements at indices `size - 1` and `size` in the merged list. If `size` is odd, it returns the element at index `size - 1` in the merged list.
