The code assigns the value of `merged_list[mid]` to the variable `median`. Here, `mid` is equal to `n`, which is the middle index of the `merged_list` (since the length of `merged_list` is odd). Therefore, `median` is assigned the value of `merged_list[n]`.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with size 2n, `mid` is n, `median` is equal to `merged_list[n]` and the length of `merged_list` is odd.**
