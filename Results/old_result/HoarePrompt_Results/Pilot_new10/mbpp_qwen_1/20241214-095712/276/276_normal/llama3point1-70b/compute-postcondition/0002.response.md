Postcondition: ***`merged_list` is a sorted list of integers formed by merging and sorting `list1` and `list2`; `list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same size (`size`), and `size` is a positive integer; `middle_index` is `size - 1`. The length of `merged_list` is even because `size` is even.***
