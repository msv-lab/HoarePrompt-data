Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. It merges the two lists into a single sorted list, calculates the middle index, and computes the median based on whether the length of the merged list is even or odd. The provided assertions cover various cases, including both even and odd lengths, and the code passes these tests. Therefore, the code appears to handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
