Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size `n`, merges them into a single sorted list `merged_list`, and returns the median of this merged list. If the length of `merged_list` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements; if the length is odd, the median is the middle element.**

This summary covers the following points:
- The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (`list1` and `list2`) with the same size `n`.
- The function merges these lists into a single sorted list `merged_list`.
- The function calculates the median based on the length of `merged_list`.
- If the length of `merged_list` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements.
- If the length of `merged_list` is odd, the median is the middle element.
- There are no explicit edge cases mentioned in the code, so the functionality described above covers all possible cases.
