The code calculates the median of the `merged_list` by taking the average of the two middle elements. Since `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with a length of `2n` (even), the median is the average of the elements at indices `mid - 1` and `mid`. 

- `mid` is equal to `n`.
- The median is calculated as `(merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2`.

The values of the other variables (`list1`, `list2`, `merged_list`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `list2` is a sorted list of integers with size n, `merged_list` is a sorted list of integers with size 2n, `mid` is n, `median` is (merged_list[n - 1] + merged_list[n]) / 2**
