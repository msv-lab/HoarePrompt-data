The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. Both `list1` and `list2` are sorted lists of integers with the same size, and `size` is a positive integer. If `size` is even, the function returns the average of the elements at indices `size - 1` and `size` in the merged and sorted list. If `size` is odd, the function returns the element at index `size - 1` in the merged and sorted list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two sorted lists `list1` and `list2` of the same size and a positive integer `size`, and return the median of the merged and sorted list based on whether `size` is even or odd.
