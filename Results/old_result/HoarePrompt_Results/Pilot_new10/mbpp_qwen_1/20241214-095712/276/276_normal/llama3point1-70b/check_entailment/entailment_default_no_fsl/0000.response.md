Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code has an issue with calculating the median for both even and odd sizes of the merged list. According to the problem description and the output hints, the median should be the middle element(s) of the combined and sorted list. However, the code incorrectly sets `middle_index` to `size - 1`. For a list of size `n`, the correct middle index for even-sized lists would be `n//2 - 1` and `n//2`, and for odd-sized lists, it would be `n//2`.

For example, consider two sorted lists of size 4:
- `list1 = [1, 3, 5, 7]`
- `list2 = [2, 4, 6, 8]`

The merged and sorted list is `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8]`. The median should be the average of the 4th and 5th elements, which are 4 and 5. However, the current implementation would incorrectly calculate the median as either 4 or 5 based on the incorrect `middle_index` value.

To fix this, the code should set `middle_index` to `size // 2 - 1` for even-sized lists and `size // 2` for odd-sized lists.
