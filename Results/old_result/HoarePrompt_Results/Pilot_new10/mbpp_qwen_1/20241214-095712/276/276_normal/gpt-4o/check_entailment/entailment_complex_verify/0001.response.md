Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` meets the requirements of finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The annotated version of the code accurately describes the states of the program at different points, confirming that the function merges the two lists, sorts the resulting merged list, and then correctly calculates the median based on the length of the merged list. The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
