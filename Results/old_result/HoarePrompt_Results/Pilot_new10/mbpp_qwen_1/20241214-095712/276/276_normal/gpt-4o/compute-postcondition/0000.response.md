The code `merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)` merges `list1` and `list2` into a single list and sorts it. Since `list1` and `list2` are both sorted lists of integers with the same size `n`, their concatenation and subsequent sorting will result in a new sorted list of length `2n`. The original lists `list1` and `list2` remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **list1 is a sorted list of integers with size n, list2 is a sorted list of integers with size n, and merged_list is a sorted list of integers with size 2n**
