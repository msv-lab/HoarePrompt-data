Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The program does not handle the case where both lists are empty. In such a scenario, the function will attempt to concatenate and sort two empty lists, which results in an empty `merged_list`. When calculating the middle index, it will still try to access indices that do not exist, leading to an error. Additionally, the program does not handle the case where one of the lists is empty and the other is not, which could also lead to incorrect results or errors.
