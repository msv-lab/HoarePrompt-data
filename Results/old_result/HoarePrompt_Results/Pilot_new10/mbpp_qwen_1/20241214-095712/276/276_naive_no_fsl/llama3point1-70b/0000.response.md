Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program has an issue with calculating the median for lists of even size. The `middle_index` variable is incorrectly set to `size - 1`, which will lead to accessing an out-of-bounds index for the list. For a list of even size, the correct middle indices should be `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`. 

Here's a corrected version of the code:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index1 = size // 2 - 1
    middle_index2 = size // 2
    if size % 2 == 0:
        median = (merged_list[middle_index1] + merged_list[middle_index2]) / 2
    else:
        median = merged_list[middle_index2]
    return median
```

With this correction, the program should handle both even and odd-sized lists correctly.
