Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The function uses a loop to iterate through each digit of the input number `n`, adding each digit to the `total` variable. This process continues until all digits have been processed, and the final sum is returned.

The assertions provided cover a range of test cases:
- `func_1(345)` returns `12` (3 + 4 + 5 = 12)
- `func_1(12)` returns `3` (1 + 2 = 3)
- `func_1(97)` returns `16` (9 + 7 = 16)

These test cases cover different scenarios including numbers with multiple digits and single-digit numbers. Since the function handles these cases correctly and the provided test cases do not reveal any issues, we can conclude that the function works correctly for the described problem.
