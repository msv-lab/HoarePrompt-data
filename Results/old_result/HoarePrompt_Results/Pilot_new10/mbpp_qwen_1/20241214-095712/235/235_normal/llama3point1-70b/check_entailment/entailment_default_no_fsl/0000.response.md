Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality of summing the digits of a non-negative integer. It handles all potential cases where `n` is a non-negative integer, including edge cases like `0` (which has a single digit whose sum is `0`) and larger numbers with multiple digits. The code converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up. This approach works for all non-negative integers without any issues.
