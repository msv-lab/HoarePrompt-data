Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer `n`. The function converts `n` to a string to iterate over each digit, converts each digit back to an integer, and sums them up. This approach is accurate and handles all valid inputs as per the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
