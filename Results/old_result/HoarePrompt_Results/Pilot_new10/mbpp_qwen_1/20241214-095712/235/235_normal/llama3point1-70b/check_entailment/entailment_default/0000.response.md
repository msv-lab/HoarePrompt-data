Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It converts the integer to a string, iterates over each character (digit), converts each character back to an integer, and sums them up. This approach works for every potential case of non-negative integers, including edge cases like 0, single-digit numbers, and large numbers. The code handles all digits correctly and there are no missing functionalities or edge cases that need special mention.
