Final: **True**

Reason: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The logic within the `func_1` function is sound, and the given test cases (`assert` statements) confirm its correctness. The output hints accurately describe the functionality of the function, and there is no indication in the provided information that the program fails to meet the requirements for any potential valid input. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
