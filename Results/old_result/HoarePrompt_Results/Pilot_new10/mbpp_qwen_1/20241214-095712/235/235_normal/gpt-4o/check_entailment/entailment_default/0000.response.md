Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. The code uses a while loop to iterate through each digit of the number, adding each digit to a running total (`total`). The loop continues until `n` becomes 0, ensuring that all digits are processed. Given the assertions provided:

- `func_1(345) == 12` (3 + 4 + 5 = 12)
- `func_1(12) == 3` (1 + 2 = 3)
- `func_1(97) == 16` (9 + 7 = 16)

The code works correctly for these examples. Additionally, since the logic of summing digits of a non-negative integer is straightforward and the provided code accurately reflects this logic, it should handle all potential cases of non-negative integers without issues. Therefore, the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
