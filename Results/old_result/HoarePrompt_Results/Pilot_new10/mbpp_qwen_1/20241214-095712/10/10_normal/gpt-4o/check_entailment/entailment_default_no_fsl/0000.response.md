Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a triangular prism correctly. The formula used, \( \text{volume} = 0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \), matches the standard formula for the volume of a triangular prism. The assertions provided in the code verify the function with different sets of inputs, and the output hints confirm that the function works as intended. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues with the provided code that would cause it to fail for any input.
