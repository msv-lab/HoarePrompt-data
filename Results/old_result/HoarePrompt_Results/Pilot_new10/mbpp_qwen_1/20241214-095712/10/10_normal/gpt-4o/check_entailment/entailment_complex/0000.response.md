Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the calculation for the volume of a triangular prism. The function accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`, which represent the base, height of the triangle, and the length of the prism, respectively. According to the problem description, the function should calculate the area of the triangular base using the formula \(0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\) and then multiply this area by the `length` to find the volume of the prism. The function returns the calculated volume.

The assertions provided in the annotated program also validate the correctness of the function for different sets of input values:
- `func_1(10, 8, 6)` should return 240, which matches \(0.5 \times 10 \times 8 \times 6\).
- `func_1(3, 2, 2)` should return 6, which matches \(0.5 \times 3 \times 2 \times 2\).
- `func_1(1, 2, 1)` should return 1, which matches \(0.5 \times 1 \times 2 \times 1\).

Since the function correctly implements the required formula and the assertions pass for the given test cases, the program is correct according to the problem description.
