Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(b, h, l)` correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism. According to the problem description, the volume \( V \) of a triangular prism can be calculated using the formula:

\[ V = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height}\right) \times \text{length} \]

In the annotated program, the function takes three parameters:
- `b`: representing the base length of the triangular face.
- `h`: representing the height of the triangular face.
- `l`: representing the length of the prism.

The function then computes the area of the triangular base as \( \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h \) and multiplies it by the length of the prism `l` to get the volume of the triangular prism. This matches the mathematical formula provided in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases as it always follows the problem description.
