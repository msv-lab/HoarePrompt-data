The `volume` variable is assigned the value of `base_area * length`. The `base_area` is initially defined as `0.5 * base * height`, and the `length` is non-negative. Therefore, the `volume` will be calculated using these values.

Output State: **`base_area` is 0.5 * `base` * `height`, `base` is non-negative, `height` is non-negative, `length` is non-negative, `volume` is `base_area * length`**
