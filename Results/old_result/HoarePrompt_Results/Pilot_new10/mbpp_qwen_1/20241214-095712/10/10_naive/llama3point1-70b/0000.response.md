Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(b, h, l)` calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the formula \( \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). This formula is correct according to the problem description, which asks for the volume of a triangular prism. Since the function implements the formula accurately and there are no apparent edge cases or missing logic, the function should work correctly for all valid inputs (i.e., positive values for base, height, and length). Therefore, there is no potential case found where the program does not work as expected.
