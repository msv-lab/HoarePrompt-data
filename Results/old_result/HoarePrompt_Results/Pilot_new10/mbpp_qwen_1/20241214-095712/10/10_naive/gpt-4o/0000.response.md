Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program calculates the volume of a triangular prism correctly using the formula \( \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{2} \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length} \). The examples given (`func_1(10, 8, 6) == 240`, `func_1(3, 2, 2) == 6`, `func_1(1, 2, 1) == 1`) all match the expected results. There are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause the function to fail. Thus, the program meets the requirements for every potential case described.
