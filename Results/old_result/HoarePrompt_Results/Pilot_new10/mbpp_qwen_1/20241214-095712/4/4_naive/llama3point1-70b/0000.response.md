Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by performing a bitwise XOR operation and counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. This approach is correct because:

- If the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, the XOR result will have exactly one '1' in its binary representation.
- If they differ at more than one bit position, the XOR result will have more than one '1'.
- If they are identical, the XOR result will be 0, which has no '1's.

Since the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, it should work for all valid inputs. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the provided description and the nature of the XOR operation.
