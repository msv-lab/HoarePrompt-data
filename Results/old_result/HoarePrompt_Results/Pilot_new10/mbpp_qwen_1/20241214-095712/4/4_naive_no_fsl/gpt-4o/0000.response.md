Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The logic used in the function is correct. Here's a brief explanation:

- `xor_result = a ^ b` computes the bitwise XOR of `a` and `b`. This will result in a number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of `a` and `b` are different.
- `xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0` checks if `xor_result` has exactly one bit set to 1. This works because subtracting 1 from a number that has exactly one bit set flips all the bits after that bit (including the bit itself) to 1, and then the AND operation with the original number results in 0.

Given the test cases provided:
- `func_1(13, 9)` returns `True` because `13` in binary is `1101` and `9` is `1001`, their XOR is `0100` (4), which has exactly one bit set.
- `func_1(15, 8)` returns `False` because `15` in binary is `1111` and `8` is `1000`, their XOR is `0111` (7), which has more than one bit set.
- `func_1(2, 4)` returns `False` because `2` in binary is `0010` and `4` is `0100`, their XOR is `0110` (6), which has more than one bit set.
- `func_1(2, 3)` returns `True` because `2` in binary is `0010` and `3` is `0011`, their XOR is `0001` (1), which has exactly one bit set.
- `func_1(5, 1)` returns `True` because `5` in binary is `0101` and `1` is `0001`, their XOR is `0100` (4), which has exactly one bit set.
- `func_1(1, 5)` returns `True` because `1` in binary is `0001` and `5` is `0101`, their XOR is `0100` (4), which has exactly one bit set.

Since the function passes all the provided test cases and the logic is sound, the program is correct.
