Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by using a bitwise XOR operation and counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. The output hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, accepting two non-negative integers and returning `True` if the XOR result has exactly one '1'. There are no edge cases or potential inputs mentioned in the problem description that would cause this function to fail based on the given logic. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
