Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment align well with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly uses the XOR operation to identify differing bits between two numbers and counts the number of '1's in the resulting binary string. If the count is exactly 1, it means the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The annotated explanation supports this, stating that the function returns `True` if the count is exactly 1 and `False` otherwise. Given the problem description and the provided code, the original assessment is accurate.
