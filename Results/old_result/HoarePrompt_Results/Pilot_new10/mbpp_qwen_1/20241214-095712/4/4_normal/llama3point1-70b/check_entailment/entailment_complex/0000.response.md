Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two non-negative integers `num1` and `num2`, performs a bitwise XOR operation on them (`num1 ^ num2`), converts the result to its binary representation using `bin()`, counts the number of '1's in this binary string with `.count('1')`, and returns `True` if this count is exactly 1, otherwise it returns `False`. 

This approach ensures that the function will return `True` only when the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. The function correctly handles all cases where the input numbers meet the criteria and also correctly identifies cases where they do not, thus fulfilling the requirements of the problem description accurately.
