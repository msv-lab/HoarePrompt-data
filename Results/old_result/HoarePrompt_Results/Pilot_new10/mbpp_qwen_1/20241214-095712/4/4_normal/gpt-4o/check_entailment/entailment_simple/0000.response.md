Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input and checks whether they differ at exactly one bit position. 

Here's how the function works:
1. It computes the XOR of `a` and `b`, which results in a number whose bits are set only at positions where `a` and `b` differ.
2. It then checks if this XOR result is a power of 2 using the condition `xor_result != 0 and xor_result & xor_result - 1 == 0`.
   - A number is a power of 2 if its binary representation has exactly one '1' bit and all other bits are '0'.
   - The expression `xor_result & xor_result - 1` will be zero if and only if `xor_result` is a power of 2. This is because subtracting 1 from a power of 2 flips all the bits after the single '1' bit, and the bitwise AND with the original number will yield zero.

The provided test cases verify different scenarios:
- When `a` and `b` differ at exactly one bit (e.g., `2` and `3`), the function returns `True`.
- When `a` and `b` do not differ at exactly one bit (e.g., `13` and `9`, `15` and `8`, `2` and `4`, `5` and `1`), the function returns `False`.

Since the function logic correctly checks if the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position and the test cases validate this behavior, the program is correct according to the problem description.
