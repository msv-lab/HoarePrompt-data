Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements the functionality described in the problem statement correctly. It uses a bitwise XOR operation to compare the two numbers, which will result in a number where each bit is set to 1 if the corresponding bits of the two numbers are different. Counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result using `bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1')` and checking if this count is exactly 1 ensures that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This approach works for all potential cases without any edge cases being missed.
