You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the two numbers differ at one bit position only or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if two numbers differ at exactly one bit position by performing a bitwise XOR operation and counting the number of '1's in the binary representation of the result. This approach is correct because:

- If the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position, the XOR result will have exactly one '1' in its binary representation.
- If they differ at more than one bit position, the XOR result will have more than one '1'.
- If they are identical, the XOR result will be 0, which has no '1's.

Since the function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement, it should work for all valid inputs. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause this function to fail based on the provided description and the nature of the XOR operation.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num1 and num2 are non-negative integers.
def func_1(num1, num2):
    return bin(num1 ^ num2).count('1') == 1
    #The program returns True if the number of '1's in the binary representation of (num1 XOR num2) is exactly 1, otherwise False


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
