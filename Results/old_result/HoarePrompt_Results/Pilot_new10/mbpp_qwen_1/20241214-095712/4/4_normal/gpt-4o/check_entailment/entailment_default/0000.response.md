Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code checks whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. The function `func_1` first computes the XOR of the two numbers. If the result is a power of 2, it means that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position; otherwise, they differ at more than one bit position or not at all.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios:
- `func_1(13, 9)` returns `True` because `13` (1101 in binary) and `9` (1001 in binary) differ at exactly one bit position.
- `func_1(15, 8)` returns `False` because `15` (1111 in binary) and `8` (1000 in binary) differ at more than one bit position.
- `func_1(2, 4)` returns `False` because `2` (0010 in binary) and `4` (0100 in binary) differ at more than one bit position.
- `func_1(2, 3)` returns `True` because `2` (0010 in binary) and `3` (0011 in binary) differ at exactly one bit position.
- `func_1(5, 1)` returns `True` because `5` (0101 in binary) and `1` (0001 in binary) differ at exactly one bit position.
- `func_1(1, 5)` returns `True` because `1` (0001 in binary) and `5` (0101 in binary) differ at exactly one bit position.

The function correctly implements the logic to determine if the XOR result is a power of 2, which ensures that the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. Therefore, the code is correct for all the given cases.
