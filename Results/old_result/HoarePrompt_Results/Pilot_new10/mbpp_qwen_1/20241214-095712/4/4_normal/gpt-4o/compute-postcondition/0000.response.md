The XOR operation (`^`) between two integers `a` and `b` results in a new integer `xor_result`. Since the initial values of `a` and `b` are non-negative integers, `xor_result` will also be a non-negative integer resulting from the XOR operation on `a` and `b`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer, `b` is a non-negative integer, `xor_result` is `a ^ b`**
