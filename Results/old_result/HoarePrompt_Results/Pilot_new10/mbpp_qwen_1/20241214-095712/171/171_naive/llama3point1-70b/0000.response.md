Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the given number `n` has an odd parity by using the expression `n % 2 != 0`. This expression returns `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even, which correctly implements the requirement to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. Since the function works correctly for all potential cases (any integer value), the program meets the problem description.
