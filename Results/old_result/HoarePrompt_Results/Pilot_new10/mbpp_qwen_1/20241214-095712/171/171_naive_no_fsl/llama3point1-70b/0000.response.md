Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the given number `n` is odd by using the condition `n % 2 != 0`. However, this function does not actually determine the parity of the number as described in the problem statement. Instead, it returns `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. To meet the requirement of finding whether the parity of a given number is odd, the function should return `True` if the number is even (since even numbers have an odd parity) and `False` if the number is odd. Therefore, the function should be modified to return `not (n % 2 != 0)` or equivalently, `(n % 2 == 0)`.
