Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The problem description asks for a function to find whether the parity of a given number is odd. However, the provided function `func_1` checks if the number is even (`n % 2 != 0`), which is incorrect. The function should check if the number is odd. The provided test cases and output hints confirm that the function incorrectly identifies the parity as even when it should be odd. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
