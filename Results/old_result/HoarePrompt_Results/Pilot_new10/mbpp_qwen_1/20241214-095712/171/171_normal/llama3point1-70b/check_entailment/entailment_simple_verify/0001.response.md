Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the problem description, the task is to write a function that determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. The provided function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. According to the annotation, the function returns `True` if `n` is an odd integer and `False` if `n` is an even integer. This behavior is opposite to what the problem description requires. The function should return `True` if the number has even parity (i.e., the number is even), and `False` if the number has odd parity (i.e., the number is odd). Therefore, the original assessment is accurate because the function does not correctly implement the required functionality.
