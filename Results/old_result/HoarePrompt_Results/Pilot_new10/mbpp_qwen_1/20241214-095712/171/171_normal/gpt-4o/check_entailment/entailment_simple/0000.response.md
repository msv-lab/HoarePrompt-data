Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The problem description asks to write a function that determines whether the parity of a given number is odd. However, the provided program checks if a number is odd by using the condition `n % 2 != 0`, which returns `True` if the number is odd and `False` if the number is even. This actually checks for odd numbers rather than finding whether the parity (odd or even) of a given number is odd.

To meet the problem description correctly, the function should check if the parity of the given number is odd, which would mean checking if the number itself is even (since even numbers have an odd parity when considering the set of all integers). Therefore, the correct implementation should return `True` if `n % 2 == 0` and `False` if `n % 2 != 0`.

Here's the corrected version of the function:

```python
def func_1(n):
    return n % 2 == 0
```

This function will correctly determine if the parity of a given number is odd (i.e., if the number is even).
