Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is odd and `False` if `n` is even. This is achieved using the modulus operator `%`, which calculates the remainder of the division of `n` by 2. If the remainder is not zero (`n % 2 != 0`), then `n` is odd, and the function returns `True`. Otherwise, `n` is even, and the function returns `False`.

The assertions provided in the comments also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases:
- `func_1(12)` returns `False` because 12 is even.
- `func_1(7)` returns `True` because 7 is odd.
- `func_1(10)` returns `False` because 10 is even.

Since the function's logic aligns with the problem description and the provided test cases validate its correctness, the program is correct.
