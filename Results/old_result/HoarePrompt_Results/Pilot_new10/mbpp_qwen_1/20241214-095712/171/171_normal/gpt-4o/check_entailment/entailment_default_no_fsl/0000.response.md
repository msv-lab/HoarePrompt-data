Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` returns `True` if `n % 2 != 0`, which means it returns `True` for odd numbers. However, the problem description asks to find whether the parity of a given number is odd, which implies the function should return `True` if the number is odd (i.e., its parity is odd) and `False` if the number is even (i.e., its parity is even). 

In the given assertions:
- `func_1(12)` should return `False` because 12 is even.
- `func_1(7)` should return `True` because 7 is odd.
- `func_1(10)` should return `False` because 10 is even.

However, the implementation of `func_1` is returning the opposite of what is expected based on the problem description. It should check if the number is even (`n % 2 == 0`) and return `False` for even numbers and `True` for odd numbers. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
