Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and returns `True` if `n` is odd, and `False` if `n` is even.** 

This summary accurately reflects the behavior of the function based on the provided code. The code directly computes `n % 2 != 0` and returns the result, which correctly identifies whether `n` is odd or even. There are no edge cases or missing functionality to consider in this simple operation.
