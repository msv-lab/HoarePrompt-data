Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is the index of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise it remains -1, `low` is 0, `high` is -1, `mid` is -1**

Explanation:
- The loop continues to execute as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`. Once `low` exceeds `high`, the loop terminates.
- If `arr[mid] == target`, then `result` is set to `mid`, and the search narrows to the lower half of the array by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.
- If `arr[mid] < target`, the search narrows to the upper half of the array by setting `low` to `mid + 1`.
- If `arr[mid] > target`, the search narrows to the lower half of the array by setting `high` to `mid - 1`.

After the loop completes, `result` will be the index of `target` in `arr` if `target` exists in `arr`, or `-1` if `target` does not exist. The loop control variables `low`, `high`, and `mid` are no longer relevant post-loop, hence their final states are not necessary to explicitly mention unless they hold specific values that impact the outcome. In this case, they do not, so they are left as initial values.
