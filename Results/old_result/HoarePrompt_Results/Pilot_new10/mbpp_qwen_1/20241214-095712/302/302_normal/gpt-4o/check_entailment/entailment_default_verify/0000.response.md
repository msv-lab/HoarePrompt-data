Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is not entirely accurate. While the provided program does implement a binary search algorithm and seems to work correctly for the given test cases, it does not guarantee finding the first occurrence of the target number in all scenarios. Specifically, if there are multiple occurrences of the target number in the array, the program will update `result` to the index of the first occurrence only when it narrows down the search to a single element. However, it will not ensure that it checks the entire range before updating `result`. For instance, consider the following case:

```
assert func_1([1, 2, 2, 2, 3, 4, 5], 2) == 1
```

In this case, the function will return `1` even though there are other occurrences of `2` at indices `2` and `3`. To ensure finding the first occurrence, the program should modify the `high = mid - 1` line to `high = mid` when `arr[mid] == target`, as follows:

```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid  # Change from high = mid - 1 to high = mid
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result
```

This modification ensures that the function continues searching in the lower half even when the middle element matches the target, thus guaranteeing the first occurrence is found.
