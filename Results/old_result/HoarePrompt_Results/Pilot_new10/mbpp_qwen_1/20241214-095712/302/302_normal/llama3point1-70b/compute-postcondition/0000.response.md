State before the loop starts: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `num` is an integer.

Now, please think step by step: Which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute?

1. The `arr` list must have at least one element to ensure that the loop can iterate at least once.
2. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0, as the loop starts from the first element of the list.
3. The variable `x` should be set to the first element of the list, which is `arr[0]`.

Given these points, we can adjust the initial state accordingly.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least one element, `num` is an integer, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `arr`**
