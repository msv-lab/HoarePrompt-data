Let's analyze the given annotated code step by step to determine the functionality of the function `func_1`.

1. **Initial State**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `num` is an integer.

2. **Function Execution**:
   - The function iterates over each element in `arr` using `enumerate` to get both the index `i` and the value `x`.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `x` is equal to `num`.
     - If `x == num`, it returns the index `i`.
     - If the loop completes without finding `num`, it exits the loop and returns `-1`.

3. **Post-loop State**:
   - After the loop, the function returns `-1` if `num` was not found in `arr`.

4. **Annotations and Return Postconditions**:
   - The annotations suggest that the function returns `0`, `1`, `2`, or `None` based on specific conditions.
   - However, the actual code only returns `i` if `x == num` or `-1` if `num` is not found.

5. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - If `num` is found in `arr`, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of `num`.
   - If `num` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `-1`.

6. **Missing Logic**:
   - The annotations mention specific return values (`0`, `1`, `2`, `None`), but the actual code only returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` or `-1`.

Given the analysis, the correct functionality should focus on the actual behavior of the code, which is searching for the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` and returning its index or `-1` if not found.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` (sorted in non-decreasing order) and an integer `num`, and returns the index of the first occurrence of `num` in `arr` or `-1` if `num` is not found.**
