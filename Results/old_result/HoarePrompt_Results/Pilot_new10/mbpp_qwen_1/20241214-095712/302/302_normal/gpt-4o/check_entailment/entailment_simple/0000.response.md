Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The provided program implements a binary search algorithm, which is designed to find any occurrence of the target number in a sorted array, not specifically the first occurrence. Here's why the program does not meet the problem description:

1. **Incorrect Handling of Multiple Occurrences**: The binary search algorithm implemented in `func_1` will return the index of any occurrence of the target number, not necessarily the first one. For example, consider the following cases:
   - `func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)` should return `1` (the first occurrence of `5`), but the code currently returns `1`, which is correct in this case.
   - `func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)` should also return `2` (the second occurrence of `5`), but the code correctly returns `2`.
   - However, if the target number is the last occurrence in the array, such as `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6)`, the current implementation would return `4`, which is correct in this case.

2. **Return Value Issue**: The problem description specifies that the function should find the index of the **first** occurrence of the given number. However, the current implementation can return any index where the target number appears, not just the first one. To fix this, you would need to modify the logic so that when the target is found, you continue searching in the left half of the array (`low = mid + 1`) until you confirm there are no earlier occurrences of the target.

To ensure the program meets the problem description, you should adjust the binary search to ensure that when the target is found, the algorithm continues to search in the left half until it confirms there are no earlier occurrences of the target. Here is a corrected version:

```python
def func_1(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1  # Continue searching in the left half
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    
    return result
```

With this modification, the function will correctly return the index of the first occurrence of the target number in the sorted array.
