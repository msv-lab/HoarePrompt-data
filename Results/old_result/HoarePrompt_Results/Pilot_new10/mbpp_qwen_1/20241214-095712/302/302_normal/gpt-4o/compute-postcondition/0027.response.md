The code `high = mid - 1` changes the value of `high` to `mid - 1`. Before this line, `mid` was defined as `(low + high) // 2`. Since the value of `low` and `high` before the assignment is unknown but we know `low <= high`, we can represent `mid` as `(low + high) // 2`. After executing the code, the new value of `high` is `mid - 1`, which can be substituted as `(low + high) // 2 - 1`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is the index of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise it remains -1, `low` and `high` are such that `low <= high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `high` is updated to (low + high) // 2 - 1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is the index of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise it remains -1, `low` and `high` are such that `low <= high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2, `high` is (low + high) // 2 - 1**
