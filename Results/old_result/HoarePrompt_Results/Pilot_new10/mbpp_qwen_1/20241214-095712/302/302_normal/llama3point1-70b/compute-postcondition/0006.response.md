Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element. `num` is an integer, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element of `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`. If `x == num`, the function returns 1. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (i.e., the postcondition remains as in the precondition).***
