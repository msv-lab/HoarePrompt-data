Let's analyze the given situation step by step:

1. **Initial State at the End of the Previous Iteration**:
   - `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element.
   - `num` is an integer.
   - `i` is 1.
   - `x` is the second element of `arr`.
   - `x` is not equal to `num`.

2. **For Loop Statement**:
   ```python
   for (i, x) in enumerate(arr):
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Conditions for the Next Iteration**:
   - The loop iterates over the elements of `arr` using `enumerate`, which provides both the index (`i`) and the value (`x`).
   - For the loop to execute one more time, the condition `i < len(arr)` must be true.

4. **Current Values**:
   - `i` is currently 1.
   - Since `arr` has at least one element and is sorted in non-decreasing order, if `i` is 1, then `x` is the second element of `arr`.

5. **Next Iteration Requirements**:
   - To proceed to the next iteration, `i` must be incremented by 1.
   - Therefore, `i` should be 2.
   - Consequently, `x` should be the third element of `arr`.

6. **Updated State**:
   - `arr` remains a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element.
   - `num` remains an integer.
   - `i` is now 2.
   - `x` is the third element of `arr`.

**Final State**:
State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order with at least one element, `num` is an integer, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element of `arr`, and `x` is not equal to `num`.**
