You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the description of program's output. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the Output hints to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
The output hints summarise the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly, but make sure that the output hints make sense.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Output hints: Let's analyze the provided annotated code step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `target`, an integer.
2. **Variable Initialization**: The variables `low` and `high` are initialized to 0 and `len(arr) - 1`, respectively. The variable `result` is initialized to -1.
3. **Binary Search Loop**:
   - The loop continues as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - Inside the loop, the middle index `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2`.
   - If `arr[mid]` equals `target`, `result` is set to `mid` and `high` is set to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.
   - If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is set to `mid + 1` to search in the right half.
   - If `arr[mid]` is greater than `target`, `high` is set to `mid - 1` to search in the left half.
4. **Post-loop State**: After the loop, `result` contains the index of `target` if found, otherwise it remains -1. `low` and `high` are set to 0 and -1, respectively, and `mid` is set to -1.
5. **Return Statement**: The function returns `result`.

From the code, we can observe that the function performs a binary search on the sorted list `arr` to find the index of `target`. If the target is found, it returns the index; otherwise, it returns -1.

**Analyze Potential Edge Cases**:
- **Empty List**: If `arr` is empty, `low` will never be less than or equal to `high`, so the loop will never run, and `result` will remain -1.
- **Single Element**: If `arr` has only one element and it matches `target`, the function will return the index of that element.
- **Target Not Found**: If `target` is not present in `arr`, the function will return -1.

Given the return postconditions and the actual code, the functionality of the function is correctly described in the initial annotation. However, it is important to note that the function returns -1 if the target is not found, regardless of whether a search process was conducted or not.

**Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and an integer `target`. It performs a binary search to find the index of `target` in `arr`. If the target is found, it returns the index; otherwise, it returns -1.

Does the code do what the problem description says,  for every potential case?
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The hints might provide such cases but make sure that the hints indeed agree with the code. Also the program description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
