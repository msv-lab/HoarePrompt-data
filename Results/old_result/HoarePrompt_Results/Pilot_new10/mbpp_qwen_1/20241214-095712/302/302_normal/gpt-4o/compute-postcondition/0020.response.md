Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is -1, `low` must be less than or equal to `high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2. If `arr[mid] < target`, then `low` is updated to (low + high) // 2 + 1. Otherwise, `high` is updated to (low + (low + high) // 2) - 1.***
