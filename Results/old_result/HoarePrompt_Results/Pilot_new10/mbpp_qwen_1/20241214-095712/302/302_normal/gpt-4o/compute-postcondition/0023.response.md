The code `mid = (low + high) // 2` calculates the middle index of the current search range defined by `low` and `high`. This calculation does not affect `low`, `high`, `target`, or `result` directly. However, this line of code indicates that a binary search process might be underway, which will update `low` and `high` based on the comparison between `arr[mid]` and `target`.

Since the exact values of `low` and `high` are not provided, we can only state that `mid` is calculated as the integer division of the sum of `low` and `high` by 2. The states of `arr`, `target`, `result`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged from their initial states.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is the index of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise it remains -1, `low` and `high` are such that `low <= high`, `mid` is (low + high) // 2**
