The code assigns the value of `mid` to `result`. Given that `mid` is calculated as `(low + high) // 2` and `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, the value of `result` will be set to `mid`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is `mid`, `mid` is `(low + high) // 2`, and `result` is equal to `mid`.**
