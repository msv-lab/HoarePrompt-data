Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment are consistent with each other. The function `func_1` correctly implements a binary search algorithm to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The provided assertions cover various scenarios, including the case where the target is not found in the array, which results in a return value of -1. The function adheres to the problem description, and there are no obvious edge cases or potential issues identified in the given code. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
