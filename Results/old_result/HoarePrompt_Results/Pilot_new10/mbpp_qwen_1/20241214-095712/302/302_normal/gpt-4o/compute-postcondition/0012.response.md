Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `low` is updated such that it points to the upper half of the array if `arr[mid] < target`, otherwise it points to the lower half of the array. `high` is updated accordingly. `result` remains -1, and `mid` is recalculated based on the new `low` and `high`.***
