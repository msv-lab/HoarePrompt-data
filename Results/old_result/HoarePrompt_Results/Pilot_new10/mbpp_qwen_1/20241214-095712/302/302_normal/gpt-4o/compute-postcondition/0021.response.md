Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is the index of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise it remains -1. If `arr[mid] == target`, `result` is set to `mid`. Otherwise, if `arr[mid] < target`, `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`; if `arr[mid] > target`, `high` is updated to `(low + (low + high) // 2) - 1`.***
