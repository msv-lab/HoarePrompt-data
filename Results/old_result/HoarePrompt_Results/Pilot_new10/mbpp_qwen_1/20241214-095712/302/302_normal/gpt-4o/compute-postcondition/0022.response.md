To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions under which the loop continues:

1. The loop condition is `low <= high`.
2. The loop body updates `low` and `high` based on the comparison between `arr[mid]` and `target`.

Let's break down the conditions and the state after the previous iteration:

- `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order.
- `target` is an integer.
- `result` is the index of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise it remains `-1`.
- If `arr[mid] == target`, `result` is set to `mid`.
- If `arr[mid] < target`, `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.
- If `arr[mid] > target`, `high` is updated to `(low + (low + high) // 2) - 1`.

At the end of the previous iteration:
- `low <= high` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

We need to ensure that the loop condition `low <= high` remains valid for the next iteration. Let's analyze the possible scenarios:

1. **Case where `arr[mid] == target`:**
   - If `arr[mid] == target`, then `result` is set to `mid`, and the loop terminates.
   - This scenario does not affect the loop continuation condition directly.

2. **Case where `arr[mid] < target`:**
   - `low` is updated to `(low + high) // 2 + 1`.
   - For the loop to continue, this update must ensure that `low <= high` still holds. Given that `mid` was such that `arr[mid] < target`, the new `low` should be adjusted accordingly.

3. **Case where `arr[mid] > target`:**
   - `high` is updated to `(low + (low + high) // 2) - 1`.
   - Similarly, this update must ensure that `low <= high` still holds. Given that `mid` was such that `arr[mid] > target`, the new `high` should be adjusted accordingly.

Given the conditions, we need to ensure that `low <= high` is maintained for the next iteration. Since the updates to `low` and `high` depend on the values of `arr[mid]` relative to `target`, we cannot directly control these values but must ensure the range is valid.

Thus, the state that needs to be adjusted is to maintain the condition `low <= high` for the next iteration.

State: **`arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `target` is an integer, `result` is the index of `target` in `arr` if found, otherwise it remains -1, `low` and `high` are updated as per the loop body, ensuring that `low <= high` must still hold true.**

In simpler terms, no specific state adjustment is needed beyond ensuring the loop condition remains valid, but the context implies that `low` and `high` should be updated correctly based on the loop body logic.
