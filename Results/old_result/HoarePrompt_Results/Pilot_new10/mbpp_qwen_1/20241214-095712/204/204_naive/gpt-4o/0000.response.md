Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether a given month number contains 31 days or not by using a set of month numbers that have 31 days. The function returns `True` if the month is in the set and `False` otherwise. The provided test cases cover the months January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12), which all have 31 days, and February (2) and June (6), which do not. Additionally, the function correctly handles the other months (April, September, November) which are not included in the test cases but would also return `False` since they do not have 31 days. Since the function behaves as expected for all tested cases and the logic is sound, the program is correct.
