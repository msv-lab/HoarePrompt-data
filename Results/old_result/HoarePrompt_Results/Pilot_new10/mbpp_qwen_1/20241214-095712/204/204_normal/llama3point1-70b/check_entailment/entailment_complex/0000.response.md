Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` representing a month number (1 through 12) and checks if this number is in the list of month numbers that contain 31 days. The list `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]` accurately represents the month numbers (January, March, May, July, August, October, December) that have 31 days. Therefore, the function will return `True` for these month numbers and `False` for the other month numbers (4, 6, 9, 11). This exactly matches the requirement specified in the problem description.
