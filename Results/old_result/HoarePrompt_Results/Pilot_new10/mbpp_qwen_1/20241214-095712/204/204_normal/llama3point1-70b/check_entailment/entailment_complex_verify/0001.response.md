Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether the given month number contains 31 days or not. The function works as intended for all potential cases of month numbers (1 through 12), returning `True` for months with 31 days and `False` for those without. The annotations confirm that the function handles all valid inputs correctly, aligning with the problem description.
