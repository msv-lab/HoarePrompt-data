Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. The function checks if the given month number `n` (where 1 represents January and 12 represents December) is one of the months that contain 31 days. 

Here's a breakdown of why the function is correct:

- The function takes an integer `n` as input, which should be between 1 and 12 inclusive.
- It defines a list `months_31_days` containing the integers corresponding to the months that have 31 days: `[1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12]`.
- It then checks if `n` is in this list using the `in` keyword.
- If `n` is in the list, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days.
- If `n` is not in the list, the function returns `False`, indicating that the month does not have 31 days.

Since the function correctly identifies the months with 31 days and returns the appropriate boolean value for each possible input, it meets the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the function is correct.
