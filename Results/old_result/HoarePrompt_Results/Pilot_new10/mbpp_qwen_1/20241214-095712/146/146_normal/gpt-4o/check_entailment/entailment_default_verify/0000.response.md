Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the list with the maximum length in a list of lists. The function iterates through each list, compares their lengths, and keeps track of the longest list found. After checking all lists, it returns the length of the longest list along with the list itself. The output hints and the provided test cases confirm that the function works as expected for the given problem description. There are no indications that the function fails to meet the requirements for any potential case. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
