#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists where each element is a list.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #`The program returns the maximum length of the sublists within 'list_of_lists' and the first sublist from 'max_sublists' that has this maximum length`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `list_of_lists` and returns the maximum length of the sublists within `list_of_lists` and the first sublist that has this maximum length.
