The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list. The function returns two values: `max_len`, which is the length of the longest list within `list_of_lists`, and `max_list`, which is the longest list among all the lists in `list_of_lists`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a parameter `list_of_lists` and return the length of the longest list and the longest list itself from `list_of_lists`.
