In the given code snippet, `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`. The variable `lst` is a list within `list_of_lists` and its length is assumed to be `max_len` because `max_len` is defined as the length of `lst`. The assignment does not change the length or contents of `lst`, nor does it affect any other lists within `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the only change is that `max_list` now references the same list as `lst`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one list, each list within `list_of_lists` has a length greater than `max_len`; `max_len` is the length of the list `lst` within `list_of_lists`, `max_list` references the same list as `lst`.**
