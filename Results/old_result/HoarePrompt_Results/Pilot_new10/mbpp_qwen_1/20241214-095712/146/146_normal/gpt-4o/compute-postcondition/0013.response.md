`max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`. The value of `max_len` is still the length of `lst`, and `list_of_lists` remains unchanged from the previous iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one list, `max_list` is now equal to `lst`.

Output State: **`max_len` is the length of `lst`, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one list, `max_list` is equal to `lst`**
