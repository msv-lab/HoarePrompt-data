Let's analyze the given program state and the for loop step by step.

### Given State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- `list_of_lists` must contain at least one list.
- If any list within `list_of_lists` has a length greater than `max_len`, `max_list` references the longest list among those longer than `max_len`. Otherwise, `max_list` remains referencing the same list as `lst`.

### For Loop Statement:
```python
for lst in list_of_lists:
    # the loop body is omitted
```

### Analysis:
1. **Condition for Loop Execution:**
   - The loop will continue as long as there are elements in `list_of_lists` that have not been processed yet.
   - After each iteration, `lst` takes the next element from `list_of_lists`.

2. **State Changes:**
   - `lst` changes to the next list in `list_of_lists` during each iteration.
   - The state of `max_list` depends on the condition involving `max_len`. If a new list in `list_of_lists` is longer than `max_len`, it might change `max_list` to reference this new list.

### Step-by-Step Adjustment of States:
- Since the loop is about to start its next iteration, `lst` will now reference the next list in `list_of_lists`.
- The state of `max_list` remains unchanged unless the next `lst` encountered is longer than `max_len`.

### Updated State:
- `list_of_lists` still contains at least one list (as the loop would not have continued otherwise).
- `max_list` either remains the same or could change if the next `lst` is longer than `max_len`.

Given these considerations, we can update the state as follows:

### Updated State:
- `list_of_lists` must contain at least one list.
- `max_list` references the longest list among those longer than `max_len` if such a list exists, otherwise it remains the same.

Since the exact contents of `list_of_lists` and `max_list` are not specified in the previous iteration, we focus on the fact that the loop is about to process the next list in `list_of_lists`.

State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one list, `max_list` references the longest list among those longer than `max_len` if such a list exists, otherwise it remains the same.**
