To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, let's break down the given code and the initial state:

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each element is a list.
   - `max_len` is 0.
   - `max_list` is an empty list.

2. **For Loop**:
   ```python
   for lst in list_of_lists:
       # the loop body is omitted
   ```

3. **Analysis**:
   - The loop iterates over each list (`lst`) in `list_of_lists`.
   - For the loop to execute, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one list (non-empty).

4. **Required Adjustments**:
   - Since the loop iterates over `list_of_lists`, we need to ensure that `list_of_lists` is non-empty. If it were empty, the loop would not execute at all.
   - We do not need to explicitly adjust `max_len` or `max_list` because they are initialized to 0 and an empty list, respectively, and these values do not affect whether the loop can execute.

5. **Final State**:
   - `list_of_lists` must contain at least one list.

Therefore, the state to be adjusted for the loop to execute is:

**State: **`list_of_lists` must contain at least one list**.
