Let's break down the function step by step:

1. **Initialization**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists.
   - It initializes `max_len` to the maximum length among all sublists in `list_of_lists`.

2. **Filtering Sublists**:
   - It creates a new list `max_sublists` containing only those sublists from `list_of_lists` whose lengths are equal to `max_len`.

3. **Returning Values**:
   - The function returns two values: `max_len` and the first sublist from `max_sublists` that has the maximum length.

### Analysis:
- The function correctly identifies the maximum length of the sublists within `list_of_lists`.
- It also correctly selects the first sublist that has this maximum length.
- There are no apparent edge cases or missing functionalities in the provided code.

### Functionality Summary:
- The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists.
- It returns the maximum length of the sublists within `list_of_lists` and the first sublist from `list_of_lists` that has this maximum length.

### Final Summary:
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of lists `list_of_lists` and returns the maximum length of the sublists within `list_of_lists` and the first sublist that has this maximum length.**
