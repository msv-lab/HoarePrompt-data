Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the maximum length from a list of lists and returns a tuple containing this maximum length and the first sublist that matches this length. However, based on the annotated version of the code, the function actually returns only the first sublist that has the maximum length, rather than all sublists with the maximum length. The annotation states that the function returns "the maximum length of the sublists within 'list_of_lists' and the first sublist that has this maximum length," which implies that only one sublist is returned. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirement specified in the problem description to return a list of all maximum length sublists.
