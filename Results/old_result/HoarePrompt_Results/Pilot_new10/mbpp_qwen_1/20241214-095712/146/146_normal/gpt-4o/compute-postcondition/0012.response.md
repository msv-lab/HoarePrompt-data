The code snippet provided is:
```python
max_len = len(lst)
```
Now, let's think step by step: The code calculates the length of the list `lst` and assigns it to the variable `max_len`. The initial state indicates that `list_of_lists` must contain at least one list, and `max_len` and `max_list` remain unchanged from the previous iteration. After executing this line of code, the value of `max_len` is updated to the length of `lst`.

Since the initial state only mentions the conditions for `list_of_lists` and `max_len` and `max_list` remaining unchanged, these conditions are still valid. Therefore, the updated state is that `max_len` is now the length of `lst`.

Output State: **`max_len` is the length of `lst`, `list_of_lists` must contain at least one list, `max_list` remains as it was from the previous iteration.**
