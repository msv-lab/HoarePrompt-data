Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both accurately reflect the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type or if the tuple is empty. The annotations provide a clear step-by-step explanation of the program's behavior, which matches the intended logic described in the problem statement. There are no issues or edge cases identified in the provided assertions or the annotated version that suggest the original assessment should be changed.
