Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type by converting each element to its type, creating a set of these types, and checking if the length of the set is 1. This logic correctly identifies whether all elements in the tuple share the same type, aligning with the problem description. The annotations also clarify that the function returns `True` if all elements are of the same type and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the original assessment is correct.
