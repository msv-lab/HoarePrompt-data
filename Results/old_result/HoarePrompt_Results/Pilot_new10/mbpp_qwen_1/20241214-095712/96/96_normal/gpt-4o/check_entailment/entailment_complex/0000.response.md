Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. Here's why:

1. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input.
2. It first checks if the tuple is empty using `if (not tup):`. If the tuple is empty, it returns `True`, which aligns with the requirement to return `True` if all elements are of the same type (since there are no elements).
3. If the tuple is not empty, it proceeds to check the type of the first element using `first_type = type(tup[0])`.
4. It then iterates through each element in the tuple and compares its type with `first_type`. If any element's type differs from `first_type`, it immediately returns `False`.
5. If the loop completes without finding any differing types, it returns `True`.

The provided test cases also validate the correctness of the implementation:
- `func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.
- `func_1((1, 2, '4'))` returns `False` because the elements are of different types (integer, integer, string).
- `func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5))` returns `True` because all elements are integers.

Thus, the program correctly checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type, meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
