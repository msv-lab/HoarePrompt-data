Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The annotations support this, showing that the function returns `True` if the tuple is empty or if all elements are of the same type, and `False` otherwise. The original assessment is accurate as the function behaves as expected and passes the provided test cases.
