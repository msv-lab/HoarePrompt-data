Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The function handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is correct. It also iterates through the tuple and compares the type of each element with the type of the first element, returning `False` as soon as it finds a differing type, and `True` if all types match. The provided test cases cover different scenarios (all elements of the same type, mixed types), and the function passes these tests. The output hints also correctly summarize the functionality of the function. Therefore, the function is correct for all potential cases based on the problem description.
