Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type. It handles an empty tuple by returning `True`, which is correct since there are no different types in an empty tuple. The function also iterates through the tuple and compares the type of each element with the type of the first element, returning `False` as soon as it finds a differing type, and `True` if all types match. The provided test cases cover different scenarios (all elements of the same type, mixed types), and the function passes these tests. Therefore, the function appears to be correct for all potential cases.
