Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly checks if all elements in the tuple have the same data type. The function uses a set to store the unique types of elements in the tuple. If all elements have the same type, the length of the set will be 1. This approach handles all potential cases as long as the input is a tuple. Therefore, the function works as expected for any tuple input.
