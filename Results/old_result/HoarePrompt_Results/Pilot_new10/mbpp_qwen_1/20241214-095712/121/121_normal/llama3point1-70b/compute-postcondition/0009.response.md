The code `count += 1` increments the value of `count` by 1. The initial value of `count` is 1, so after executing this line, `count` will be 2. The other variables (`n`, `num`, and the function `func_1(num)`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n) and not equal to 1; `count` is 2; `num` is 7; the function `func_1(num)` evaluates to True; the current value of `num` is either 1 more than a multiple of 6 or 5 more than a multiple of 6**
