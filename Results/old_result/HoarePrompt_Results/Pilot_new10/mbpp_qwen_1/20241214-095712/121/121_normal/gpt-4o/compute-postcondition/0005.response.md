The code `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0` updates the value of `S_next` based on the current values of `S0` and `S1`. Given the initial state where `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, and `i` is 2, the calculation for `S_next` is straightforward.

- `S0` is 1
- `S1` is 1
- `i` is 2 (unchanged)

So, `S_next = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3`.

Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 1, `i` is 2, `S_next` is 3**
