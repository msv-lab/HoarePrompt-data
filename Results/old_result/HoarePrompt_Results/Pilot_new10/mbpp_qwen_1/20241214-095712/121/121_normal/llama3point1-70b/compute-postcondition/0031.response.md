The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n). The function returns 7 under certain conditions: when `n` is either 1 more than a multiple of 6 or 5 more than a multiple of 6, and it initially sets `num` to 7. Additionally, the function returns 8, 9, and 7 in other cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return 7, 8, 9, or 7 based on specific conditions involving `n`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer, and returns 7, 8, 9, or 7 based on specific conditions involving `n`.**
