Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 <= n) and the code to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number has been initiated but no specific value has been assigned to any new variables yet.**

Note: The initial state remains unchanged as no code has been executed to modify the variables. The comment in the code does not affect the state of the variables.
