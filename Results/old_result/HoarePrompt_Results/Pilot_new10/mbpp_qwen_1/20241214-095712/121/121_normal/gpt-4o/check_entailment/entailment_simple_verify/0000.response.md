Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` implements a linear recurrence relation for generating a sequence where \( S_0 = 1 \), \( S_1 = 1 \), and \( S_i = 2S_{i-1} + S_{i-2} \) for \( i \geq 2 \). This sequence is not the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence, which is defined as \( P_n = 2^{2^n} + 1 \). The provided assertions and the problem description indicate that the function should generate Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, but the function does not do so. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is not correct based on the problem description.
