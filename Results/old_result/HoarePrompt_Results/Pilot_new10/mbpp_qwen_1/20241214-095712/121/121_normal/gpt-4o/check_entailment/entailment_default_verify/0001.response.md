Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not generate the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. The output hints confirm that the function generates a sequence based on a specific recurrence relation but does not generate the intended sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. The function returns the (n+1)th term in a particular sequence, which is different from the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime sequence as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
