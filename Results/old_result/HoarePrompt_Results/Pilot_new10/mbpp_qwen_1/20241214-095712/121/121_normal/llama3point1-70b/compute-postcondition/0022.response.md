The value of `num` is incremented by 1, so `num` becomes 9. The values of `n` and `count` remain unchanged, and the condition for returning 8 does not apply because `count` is either 3 or remains 2, which is not equal to `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n) and not equal to 1; `count` is either 3 or remains 2; `num` is 9.**
