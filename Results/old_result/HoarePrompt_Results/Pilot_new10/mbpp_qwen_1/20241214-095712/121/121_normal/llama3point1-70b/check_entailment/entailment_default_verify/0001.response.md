Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided implementation does not correctly generate Newman-Shanks-Williams (NSW) primes. The function `func_2` uses a heuristic (`num % 6 in [1, 5]`) to filter primes, which is not sufficient for identifying NSW primes. Additionally, the sequence generation and prime checking logic are flawed. The output hints do not align with the correct definition of NSW primes, as they do not mention generating the NSW sequence and checking each term for primality. Therefore, the original assessment correctly identifies the issue with the program.
