The code swaps the values of `S0` and `S1` with `S1` and `S_next` respectively. Initially, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, and `S_next` is 7. After the assignment, `S0` will take the value of `S1`, which is 3, and `S1` will take the value of `S_next`, which is 7. The other variables, `n` and `i`, remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `i` is 3**
