Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The function `func_2` does not correctly implement the logic to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. According to the Newman-Shanks-Williams sequence, the sequence starts with 7, and subsequent primes are of the form \(6k \pm 1\), where \(k\) is an integer. However, the current implementation checks if a number is prime and then checks if it is 1 more or 5 more than a multiple of 6. This is a valid condition for some primes but not for all Newman-Shanks-Williams primes.

For example, consider the first few Newman-Shanks-Williams primes: 7, 13, 19, 37, 43, 61, etc. The function correctly returns 7 when `n` is 1, but for `n > 1`, it may miss some primes that are part of the sequence. Specifically, the function does not handle cases where the next prime in the sequence is not immediately after the previous one but rather further down the list of primes.

A counterexample is when `n = 2`, the correct answer should be 13, but the function might return a different prime number due to the way it increments and checks primality. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
