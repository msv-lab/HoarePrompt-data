Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. The problem description asks for a function to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, but the provided implementation does not generate prime numbers at all. Instead, it generates a sequence defined by the recurrence relation \(S_i = 2S_{i-1} + S_{i-2}\) with initial conditions \(S_0 = 1\) and \(S_1 = 1\). The sequence generated is:

- For \(n = 0\): \(1\)
- For \(n = 1\): \(1\)
- For \(n = 2\): \(3\)
- For \(n = 3\): \(7\)
- For \(n = 4\): \(17\)
- For \(n = 5\): \(41\)

However, these values are not prime numbers. For example, the first few terms of the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence (which are prime numbers) are: 2, 3, 7, 41, 239, 577, 3329, etc. Notice that the values produced by the given function do not match these primes. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
