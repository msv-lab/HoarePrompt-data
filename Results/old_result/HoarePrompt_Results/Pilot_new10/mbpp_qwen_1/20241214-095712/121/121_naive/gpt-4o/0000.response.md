Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` does not correctly implement the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence. The sequence is defined such that each term \( P_n \) is given by the formula:

\[ P_n = 2^{2^n} + 1 \]

However, the provided function generates terms using a linear recurrence relation which does not match this definition. For instance, for \( n = 3 \), the expected value according to the Newman–Shanks–Williams sequence is \( 2^{2^3} + 1 = 257 \), but the function returns 7. Similarly, for \( n = 4 \), the expected value is \( 2^{2^4} + 1 = 65537 \), but the function returns 17. These discrepancies show that the function does not correctly generate Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers.
