Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` generates a sequence based on a recurrence relation but does not actually generate Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. The sequence generated by the recurrence relation given in the function is not the sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes. To verify this, consider the first few terms of the sequence generated by the function:

- For \( n = 0 \): \( 1 \)
- For \( n = 1 \): \( 1 \)
- For \( n = 2 \): \( 3 \)
- For \( n = 3 \): \( 7 \)
- For \( n = 4 \): \( 17 \)
- For \( n = 5 \): \( 41 \)

The values \( 7 \), \( 17 \), and \( 41 \) match the provided test cases, but they do not correspond to the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime sequence. The actual Newman–Shanks–Williams prime sequence starts with \( 2, 3, 7, 29, 593, 524887, \ldots \).

Since the function does not generate the correct sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, it is incorrect.
