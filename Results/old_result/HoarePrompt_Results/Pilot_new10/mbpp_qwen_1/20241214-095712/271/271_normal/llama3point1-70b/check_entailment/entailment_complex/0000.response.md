Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes a single parameter `tuples`, which is expected to be a list of tuples containing numerical values (either integers or floats). This aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should take a list of tuples.

2. **Average Calculation**: Inside the function, the line `[(sum(val) / len(tuples)) for val in zip(*tuples)]` calculates the average for each corresponding position across all tuples:
   - `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, creating an iterator that aggregates elements from each tuple at the same index.
   - `sum(val)` computes the sum of the values in each aggregated group.
   - `sum(val) / len(tuples)` then divides the sum by the number of tuples to get the average.
   - A list comprehension generates a new list with these computed averages.

3. **Edge Case Handling**: The function returns an empty list when `tuples` is an empty list, which is consistent with the problem description's requirement that the function should return an empty list for an empty input.

Given these points, the function `func_1` accurately performs the required operation of computing the average of corresponding elements across all tuples in the list, thus meeting the problem description in all cases.
