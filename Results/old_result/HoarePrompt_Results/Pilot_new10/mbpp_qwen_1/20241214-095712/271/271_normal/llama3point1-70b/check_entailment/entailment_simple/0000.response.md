Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Validation**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `tuples`, which is expected to be a list of tuples containing numerical values (integers or floats). The function does not explicitly validate this, but it assumes that the input is in the correct form.

2. **Averaging Across Tuples**: The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the list of tuples, effectively aligning the elements at the same positions across all tuples. This results in an iterator of tuples, where each tuple contains elements from the same position in the original tuples.

3. **Summing and Averaging**: For each aligned group of elements, the function computes the sum using `sum(val)` and divides by the length of the `tuples` list (`len(tuples)`) to get the average.

4. **Returning the Result**: The result is a list comprehension that generates a list of these computed averages.

Given these points, the function correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the list of tuples, meeting the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
