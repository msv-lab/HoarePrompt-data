`averages` appends the current value of `avg` to itself, making the list contain two elements: the original `avg` and the new `avg`. The value of `i` is updated to `i + 1`, and `avg` is updated to the new calculated average based on the current `elements_at_position`.

Output State: **`elements_at_position` is a list of elements at index (i + 1) from each tuple in `tuples`; `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `tuples`; `averages` is a list containing the original `avg` and the new calculated `avg`; `tuples` retain their original values; `i` is `i + 1`; `avg` is updated to the new calculated value**
