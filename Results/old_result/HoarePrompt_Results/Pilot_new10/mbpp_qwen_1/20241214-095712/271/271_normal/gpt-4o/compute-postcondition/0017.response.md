Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains numeric values (integers or floats), and returns a list of the average values of the elements at each position across all tuples in the input list. This includes handling cases where the input list is empty or contains tuples of varying lengths, resulting in the function returning an empty list in such scenarios.**
