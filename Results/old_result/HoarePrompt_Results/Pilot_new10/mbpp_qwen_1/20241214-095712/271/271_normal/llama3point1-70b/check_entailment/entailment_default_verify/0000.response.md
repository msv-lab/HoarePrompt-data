Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The program handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty list, as indicated in the output hints. Since the problem description and the output hints do not mention any other edge cases or specific requirements beyond averaging the corresponding values, the original assessment of correctness is valid.
