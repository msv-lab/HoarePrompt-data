Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately describes the behavior of the program. The function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple in the input list of tuples. The use of `zip(*tuples)` transposes the list of tuples, allowing the function to iterate over each position and sum the values, then divide by the number of tuples to get the average. Given the problem description and the annotations, the original assessment of correctness is accurate.
