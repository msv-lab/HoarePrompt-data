Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly computes the average of the corresponding elements across all tuples in the input list. It handles the case where the input list is empty by returning an empty list, as stated in the output hints. The function uses `zip(*tuples)` to transpose the list of tuples, allowing it to iterate over corresponding elements and calculate their average. This approach works for any number of tuples and any number of elements within each tuple, as long as all tuples have the same length. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
