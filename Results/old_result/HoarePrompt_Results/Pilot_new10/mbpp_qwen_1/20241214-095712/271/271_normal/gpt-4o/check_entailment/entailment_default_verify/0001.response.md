Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is correct because it handles any potential case where the input is a tuple of tuples with numeric values. However, upon closer inspection, the function does not handle cases where the input tuples have varying lengths. The function assumes that all tuples have the same number of elements, which can lead to incorrect results or errors if this assumption is not met. The output hints indicate that the function should handle cases where input tuples have varying lengths by returning an empty list, but the provided implementation does not account for this scenario. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate as the function does not correctly handle all potential cases.
