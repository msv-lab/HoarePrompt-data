#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains numeric values (integers or floats).
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        
        averages.append(avg)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `averages` is a list of the average values of the elements at each position across all tuples in `tuples`; `tuples` retain their original values; `num_elements` is the number of elements in the first tuple of `tuples`.
    return averages
    #`The program returns the list of average values of the elements at each position across all tuples in 'tuples'`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of tuples, where each tuple contains numeric values (integers or floats), and returns a list of the average values of the elements at each position across all tuples in the input list. This includes handling cases where the input list is empty or contains tuples of varying lengths, resulting in the function returning an empty list in such scenarios.
