Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple for each position. It handles cases where the input list is not empty and all tuples have the same length. The function also correctly returns an empty list when the input list is empty, which aligns with the problem description and the output hints. Since the code works for all the provided test cases and handles the described edge cases, it meets the requirements for every potential case.
