The code `averages.append(avg)` appends the value of `avg` to the list `averages`. The value of `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `elements_at_position`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`num_elements` must be greater than 0; `elements_at_position` is a list of elements extracted from the tuples at index `i`; `avg` is the sum of `elements_at_position` divided by the length of `elements_at_position`; `averages` is a list containing `avg`**
