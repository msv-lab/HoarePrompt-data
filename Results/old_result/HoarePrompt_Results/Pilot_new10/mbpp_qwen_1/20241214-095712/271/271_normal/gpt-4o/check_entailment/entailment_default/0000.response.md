Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It calculates the average of the elements at each position across all tuples in the input list. The function iterates over the first tuple to determine the number of elements and then computes the average for each corresponding position across all tuples. The code handles cases where the input list is empty or contains tuples of varying lengths by returning an empty list in such scenarios, as indicated by the output hints. All provided assertions confirm the correctness of the implementation. Therefore, the code works correctly for every potential case within the scope of the problem description.
