Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function correctly computes the average of the corresponding values from each tuple at each position as specified in the problem description. The annotations match the functionality of the code, and there are no issues or edge cases that would make the original assessment inaccurate. The function handles the provided test cases correctly, and the assumptions about valid inputs align with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
