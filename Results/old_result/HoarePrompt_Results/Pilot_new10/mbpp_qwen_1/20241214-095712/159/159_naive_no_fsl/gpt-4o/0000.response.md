Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where \(r\) is the radius and \(h\) is the height. The function is tested with three assertions that cover different values for the radius and height. All assertions pass, and the results match the expected values within the given relative tolerance. Since the function correctly implements the formula for the volume of a cone and passes all provided test cases, it appears to be correct for the given problem description. There are no obvious edge cases or potential issues found that would cause the function to fail for other inputs.
