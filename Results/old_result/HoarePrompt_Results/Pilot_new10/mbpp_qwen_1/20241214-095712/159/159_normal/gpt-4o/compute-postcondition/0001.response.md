The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative floating-point numbers. The function returns the value calculated as \( \frac{1}{3} \times \mathbf{math.pi} \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative floating-point numbers `radius` and `height`, and return the volume of a cylinder with the given radius and height.
