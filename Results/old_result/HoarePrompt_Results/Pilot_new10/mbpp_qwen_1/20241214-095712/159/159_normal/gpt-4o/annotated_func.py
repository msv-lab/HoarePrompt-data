#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative floating-point numbers.
def func_1(radius, height):
    return 1 / 3 * math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    #The program returns 1/3 * math.pi * radius
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative floating-point numbers `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume of a cylinder with the given radius and height, calculated as \( \frac{1}{3} \times \mathbf{math.pi} \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \).
