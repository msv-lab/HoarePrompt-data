The annotated code and the return postconditions provide clear information about the function. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which are non-negative numbers. The function directly returns the volume of a cone using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). There are no conditional statements or loops that might alter this behavior or introduce additional logic. 

Given this, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative parameters `radius` and `height` and returns the volume of a cone calculated using the formula \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \).**
