Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). The function takes two non-negative parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume of the cone as specified in the problem description. Since the formula and the implementation match, the function works correctly for every potential case where both `radius` and `height` are non-negative.
