Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two non-negative floating-point numbers `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume of a cylinder with the given radius and height, calculated as \( \frac{1}{3} \times \mathbf{math.pi} \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \).** 

This summary accurately reflects the code and does not rely on any potentially misleading annotations. The function specifically calculates the volume of a cylinder using the provided formula, and there are no edge cases or missing functionalities to consider in this particular code snippet.
