Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is given by the equation \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). The function accepts two non-negative parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume. The use of `math.pi` ensures that the value of \(\pi\) is accurately represented. Additionally, the function correctly handles the requirement that both `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers, as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
