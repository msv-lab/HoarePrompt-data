Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\). The provided test cases validate the function with different sets of inputs and expected outputs, and the function passes these tests. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations.
