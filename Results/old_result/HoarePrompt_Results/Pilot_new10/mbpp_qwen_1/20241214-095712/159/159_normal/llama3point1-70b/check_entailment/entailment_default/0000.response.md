Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, which is \( \frac{1}{3} \times \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume of the cone as specified in the problem description. The output hints confirm that the function works as intended, and there are no apparent edge cases or potential issues with the implementation that would violate the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
