Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), with `radius` and `height` being non-negative numbers as per the problem description. The original assessment correctly identifies that the function meets the requirements for finding the volume of a cone given valid inputs. The annotations support this conclusion, and there are no identified issues with the program based on the problem description and the provided code.
