Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone, \(\frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h\), where `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers. The original assessment is accurate because the function meets the requirement specified in the problem description and handles valid inputs correctly.
