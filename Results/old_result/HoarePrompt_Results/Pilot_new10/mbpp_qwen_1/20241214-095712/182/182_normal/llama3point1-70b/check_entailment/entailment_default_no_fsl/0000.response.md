Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. The list comprehension `[s[-1] for s in strings]` iterates over each string in the tuple and extracts the last character using `s[-1]`. This functionality matches the problem description exactly, and there are no edge cases or special cases mentioned in the problem description that this function would fail to handle. Therefore, the function works correctly for every potential case described.
