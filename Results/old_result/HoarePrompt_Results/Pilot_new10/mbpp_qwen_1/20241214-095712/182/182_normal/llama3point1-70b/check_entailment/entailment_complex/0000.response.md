Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the problem description perfectly. The function `func_1` takes a tuple of strings as input and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. This behavior is consistent with the problem description, which states that the function should extract the rear index element (the last character) of each string in the given tuple. The list comprehension used in the function iterates over each string in the tuple and extracts the last character using the index `s[-1]`. Since this implementation correctly extracts the last character from each string regardless of the content or length of the strings in the tuple, the function always behaves as required by the problem description.
