Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple, which aligns with the problem description. The original assessment is accurate because the function works as intended for the provided test cases and there is no indication of potential issues with the current implementation under the assumption of valid input.
