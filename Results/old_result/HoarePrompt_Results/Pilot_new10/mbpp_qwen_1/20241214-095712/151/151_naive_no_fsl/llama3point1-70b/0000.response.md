Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` recursively flattens a nested list structure. It checks each element in the input list; if the element is a list, it recursively calls itself to flatten that sublist and extends the current flat list with the result. If the element is not a list, it appends the element directly to the flat list. This approach correctly handles all potential cases where the input can be a mix of integers and nested lists. Since there is no edge case identified where this function fails to produce the expected output, the program is correct.
