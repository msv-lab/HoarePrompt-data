Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided `func_1` function correctly flattens a nested list structure. It handles both nested lists and non-list items within the input list. The function recursively processes each element, ensuring that all elements are eventually added to the `flat_list`. Given the provided test cases and the recursive nature of the function, it appears to handle various potential cases correctly without any issues. Therefore, the program meets the requirements for all tested scenarios.
