Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure by recursively extending the flat list with elements from sublists. The function checks if each item is a list and, if so, calls itself recursively to handle the sublist. Otherwise, it appends the item directly to the flat list. This approach ensures that all elements from the nested list are included in the final flattened list. Based on the provided test cases, the function works correctly for the given examples and no edge cases were found where the function behaves incorrectly.
