State before the loop starts: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level); `flat_list` is an empty list.

To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variable `item`, which is used in the loop to iterate over each element in `nested_list`. The loop will execute if `nested_list` contains at least one item. 

Let's break this down step by step:

1. **Initial State**: `nested_list` is a list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level), and `flat_list` is an empty list.
2. **Loop Condition**: For the loop to execute, `nested_list` must have at least one item. If `nested_list` is empty, the loop will not execute.
3. **Variables Inside Loop**: During the loop execution, `item` will take on the value of each element in `nested_list`.

Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the state such that `nested_list` contains at least one item. 

**State:**
- `nested_list` is a list that must contain at least one item.
- `flat_list` remains an empty list.

Final State:
State: **`nested_list` is a list that must contain at least one item, `flat_list` is an empty list**
