Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly flattens a nested list structure. The output hints confirm that the function handles lists containing integers or other lists at any nesting level. The recursive approach ensures that all elements, regardless of their depth in the nested structure, are included in the flattened list. The original assessment is accurate because the provided test cases and the explanation align with the expected behavior of the function. The output hints also support this conclusion, indicating that the function behaves as intended for the given input types.
