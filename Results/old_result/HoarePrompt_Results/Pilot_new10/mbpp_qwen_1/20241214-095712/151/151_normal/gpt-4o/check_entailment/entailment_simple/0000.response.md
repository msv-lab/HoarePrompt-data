Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly flattens a given nested list structure. It uses recursion to handle nested lists of arbitrary depth. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Definition and Input**: The function `func_1` takes a single argument `nested_list`, which can be a list containing integers or other lists (nested to any level).

2. **Initialization**: An empty list `flat_list` is initialized to store the flattened result.

3. **Iterate Through the List**: The function iterates through each item in `nested_list`.
   - If an item is a list (`isinstance(item, list)`), the function calls itself recursively with this sublist, effectively flattening it.
   - If an item is not a list, it is directly appended to `flat_list`.

4. **Return Statement**: After processing all items, the function returns `flat_list`, which contains all elements from the original nested list, flattened.

This approach ensures that all nested structures are fully expanded into a single, flat list, meeting the problem description's requirement. The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected across different input scenarios, including lists of varying depths and structures.

Therefore, the program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement.
