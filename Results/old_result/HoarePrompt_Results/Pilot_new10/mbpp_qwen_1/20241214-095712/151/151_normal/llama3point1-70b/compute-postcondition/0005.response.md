The code appends the first element `i` from `nested_list` to `flat_list`. Since `i` is not a list, it is added directly to `flat_list`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the updated states are:

- `nested_list` remains a non-empty list that may contain integers or other lists.
- `flat_list` contains the first element `i` of `nested_list`.
- `i` is no longer the first element in `nested_list` since it has been removed (or more accurately, its reference is no longer the first element due to the append operation).

Output State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain integers or other lists; `flat_list` contains the first element `i` of `nested_list`; `i` is no longer the first element in `nested_list`.**
