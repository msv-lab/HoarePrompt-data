Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure. The function checks each item in the input list. If the item is a list, it recursively calls itself to flatten the nested list and extends the current list with the result. If the item is not a list, it simply appends the item to the current list. This ensures that all nested structures are flattened into a single list, matching the problem description.

The function handles all potential cases as described, including nested lists of any depth. The provided test cases confirm that the function works correctly for various inputs, ensuring that it meets the requirements of the problem description in every scenario.
