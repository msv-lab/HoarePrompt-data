Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the explanation provided align well with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly flattens a given nested list structure by recursively processing each element. If an element is a list, it calls itself with that sublist and extends the result to `flat_list`. Otherwise, it appends the element directly to `flat_list`. This approach ensures that all elements, regardless of their nesting level, are included in the final flattened list. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
