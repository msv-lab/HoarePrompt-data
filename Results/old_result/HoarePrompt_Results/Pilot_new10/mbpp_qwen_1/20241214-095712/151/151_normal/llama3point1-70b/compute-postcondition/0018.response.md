The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which can be a list containing integers or other lists (nested to any level). The function processes this list by recursively flattening it into a single-level list called `flat_list`. This is achieved by iterating through each element in `nested_list`, and if an element is itself a list, the function calls itself recursively to flatten that sublist and extends `flat_list` with the result. If an element is not a list, it is directly appended to `flat_list`.

The return postcondition states that the function returns `flat_list`, which is the fully flattened version of `nested_list` obtained by recursively extending `flat_list` with each element in `nested_list` until no more elements are lists.

After analyzing the code, there are no apparent edge cases or missing functionality mentioned in the annotations. The code accurately follows the described process of flattening the nested list.

Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `nested_list` and returns a fully flattened list `flat_list` by recursively processing and flattening any nested lists within `nested_list`.**
