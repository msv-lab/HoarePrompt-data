Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level), `flat_list` is an empty list extended by either the flattened version of the first element of `nested_list` if the first element is a list, or the first element itself if it is not a list.***

This postcondition covers both cases:
- If the first element `i` of `nested_list` is a list, `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(i)`.
- If the first element `i` is not a list, `flat_list` is extended by `i`.

In both scenarios, the first element `i` is no longer the first element in `nested_list` after the operation.
