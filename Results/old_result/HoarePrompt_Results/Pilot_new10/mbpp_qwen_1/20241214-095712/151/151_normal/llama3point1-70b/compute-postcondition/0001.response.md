State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain integers or other lists (nested to any level), `flat_list` is an empty list, `i` is the first element in `nested_list`**.

Step-by-step reasoning:

1. **Loop Condition**: The for loop iterates over `nested_list`. For the loop to execute, `nested_list` must contain at least one element. Therefore, `nested_list` must be a non-empty list.
   
2. **First Iteration**: In the first iteration of the loop, `i` should be set to the first element of `nested_list`. This ensures that the loop body can access and process the first element.

3. **Other States**: The state of `flat_list` remains as an empty list since it is not modified within the loop body in the given snippet. 

Thus, the required state adjustments are that `nested_list` must be a non-empty list and `i` should be set to the first element of `nested_list`.
