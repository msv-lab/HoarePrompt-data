Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened version of that list. Here’s why it is correct:

1. **Recursive Flattening**: The function checks each item in the nested list. If an item is a list, it calls itself recursively to flatten that sublist. This ensures that all levels of nesting are handled.
2. **Appending Elements**: If an item is not a list, it directly appends the item to the `flat_list`. This ensures that non-list items are included in the final output without further recursion.
3. **Test Cases**: The test cases provided in the annotations cover various scenarios, including lists with multiple levels of nesting and lists containing duplicate values. The function passes these tests, indicating that it works correctly across different inputs.
4. **Return Value**: The function returns the `flat_list`, which contains all the elements from the nested list structure in a single, flat list.

Given that the function meets the criteria specified in the problem description—flattening a nested list structure to produce a single-level list—and that it passes the provided test cases, the program is correct.
