Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the n'th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:
- \( L(0) = 2 \)
- \( L(1) = 1 \)
- For \( n > 1 \), \( L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \)

The function initializes `a` and `b` to the first two Lucas numbers (2 and 1) and then iteratively computes the next Lucas numbers up to the n'th term. This matches the problem description accurately and works for all non-negative integer values of `n`. Therefore, the program is correct.
