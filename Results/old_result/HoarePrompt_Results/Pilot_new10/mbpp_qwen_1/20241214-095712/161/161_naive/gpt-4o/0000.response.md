Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program calculates the n-th Lucas number using a simple iterative approach. However, the function `func_1` only handles positive integers for `n`. According to the problem description, the function should work for any non-negative integer `n`, including zero. 

The problem description states that the first Lucas number (when `n=0`) should be 2, which the program correctly handles. However, for `n=1`, the program returns 1, which is correct as well. The issue arises when considering `n > 1`. The program correctly computes the Lucas sequence for these values, but it does not explicitly handle negative inputs, which is outside the scope of the problem description but important for completeness.

Since the problem description does not specify handling of negative numbers, we focus on whether the function works for all non-negative integers as described. While the function works correctly for the provided test cases, it fails to demonstrate correctness for a broader range of inputs, particularly negative numbers. Therefore, without explicit handling, the program is considered incorrect.
