Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment incorrectly stated that the function returns the n'th Lucas number. However, based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, it is clear that the function actually returns the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number. The Lucas numbers are defined as \( L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \) with \( L(0) = 2 \) and \( L(1) = 1 \). The function provided computes the Fibonacci sequence starting from \( F(2) = 2 \) and \( F(1) = 1 \), where \( F(n) \) is the n-th Fibonacci number. Therefore, the function should be returning the n-th Lucas number as per the corrected interpretation, which is the (n+1)-th Fibonacci number starting from \( F(1) = 1 \) and \( F(2) = 1 \).

Given the function definition and the annotations, the correct implementation should be adjusted to match the Lucas number sequence directly. Thus, the original assessment is not accurate.
