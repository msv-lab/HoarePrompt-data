The code swaps the values of `a` and `b`, and updates `b` to be the sum of its original value and the new value of `a`. Initially, `a` is 1 and `b` is 3. After the swap, `a` becomes 3 and `b` becomes 1 + 3, which is 4. The precondition that `n` must be at least 3 remains unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is 3, `b` is 4, `n` must be at least 3**
