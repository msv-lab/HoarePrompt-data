The code `a, b = b, a + b` swaps the values of `a` and `b`, and then updates `a` to be the sum of the original values of `a` and `b`. Given the initial state where `a` is 2 and `b` is 1:

- Initially, `a` is 2 and `b` is 1.
- After executing the code, `b` will take the value of the original `a`, which is 2.
- `a` will be updated to the sum of the original values of `a` and `b`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 2.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 2**
