Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for finding the n-th Lucas number. The annotations clearly show that the program initializes the first two values of the Lucas sequence correctly and then iteratively computes the subsequent values. For n=0, it returns 2, and for n=1, it returns 1, which are the base cases of the Lucas sequence. For n > 1, the program uses a loop to compute the n-th Lucas number using the recurrence relation L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2). The annotations also confirm that after the loop, `b` contains the value of the n-th Lucas number. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
