Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the function `func_1` correctly calculates the n-th Lucas number for any non-negative integer `n`. The function handles the base cases (`n=0` and `n=1`) appropriately and uses an iterative approach to compute the Lucas sequence for `n > 1`. The provided assertions verify the correctness of the function for the given test cases. Since the problem description specifies that the function should work for any non-negative integer `n`, and the function meets this requirement, the original assessment that the program is incorrect is not accurate.
