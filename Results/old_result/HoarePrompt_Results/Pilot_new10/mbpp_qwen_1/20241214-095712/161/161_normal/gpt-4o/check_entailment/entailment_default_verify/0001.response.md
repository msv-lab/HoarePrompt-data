Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the program does not handle invalid inputs as expected. Based on the problem description and the output hints, the function should be able to handle non-negative integers correctly. However, the original assessment points out that the function does not handle negative or non-integer inputs, which is a valid concern. While the output hints suggest that the function behaves correctly for valid inputs, they do not address the issue of input validation. Therefore, the program should include input validation to ensure it behaves correctly for all potential cases, making the original assessment correct.
