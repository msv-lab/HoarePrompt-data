Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Loop Condition**: The loop is defined as `for _ in range(2, n + 1):`. This means the loop will start from 2 and continue until `n + 1`, incrementing by 1 each time.

2. **Determine the Initial State of Variables**:
   - `n` is a non-negative integer and not equal to 0 and 1. Therefore, `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute.
   - `a` is 2.
   - `b` is 1.

3. **Analyze the Loop Execution**:
   - For the loop to start, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2 because the range starts from 2.
   - The loop variable `_` will take values starting from 2 up to `n`.

4. **State Adjustment**:
   - Since `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than or equal to 2.
   - The initial values of `a` and `b` are given and do not need to be adjusted based on the loop itself.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 2, `b` is 1**
