Let's break down the annotated code and return postconditions step by step to understand the functionality of the function.

### Annotated Code Breakdown:

1. **Initial Condition:**
   - `n` is a non-negative integer.

2. **Case 1: \( n = 0 \)**
   - The function directly returns 2.
   - Postcondition: The function returns 2.

3. **Case 2: \( n = 1 \)**
   - The function directly returns 1.
   - Postcondition: The function returns 1.

4. **Case 3: \( n \geq 2 \)**
   - Variables `a` and `b` are initialized to 2 and 1 respectively.
   - A for loop runs from 2 to `n + 1`.
     - Inside the loop, `a` and `b` are updated such that `a` becomes `b` and `b` becomes `a + b`.
   - After the loop, `b` contains the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number.
   - The function returns `b`.
   - Postcondition: The function returns the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number.

### Return Postconditions Recap:
- Case 1: The function returns 2.
- Case 2: The function returns 1.
- Case 3: The function returns the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The code handles the cases where `n` is 0 and 1 correctly.
- For \( n \geq 2 \), the code correctly computes the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number using dynamic programming.

### Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 2 if `n` is 0, 1 if `n` is 1, and the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number if `n` is greater than or equal to 2.

### Final Summary:
Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 2 if `n` is 0, 1 if `n` is 1, and the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number if `n` is greater than or equal to 2.**
