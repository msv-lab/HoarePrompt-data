Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the loop condition**: The loop runs for values of `_` from 2 to `n` inclusive. This means the loop starts when `_` is 2 and continues as long as `_` is less than or equal to `n`.

2. **Determine the current state at the end of the previous iteration**:
   - `n` must be greater than or equal to 2.
   - `a` is 3.
   - `b` is 2.

3. **Understand the loop variable behavior**:
   - The loop runs as long as `_` (the loop variable) is less than or equal to `n`.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `_` must have reached the value of `n`.

4. **Adjust the states for the next iteration**:
   - Since `_` has reached `n`, for the next iteration, `_` should start from `n + 1` if the loop is to continue.
   - However, since the loop condition is checked at the start of each iteration, `n` remains unchanged unless the loop body modifies it.
   - `a` and `b` remain unchanged as there is no information suggesting they are modified within the loop.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 (as it was at the start), but `_` should start from `n + 1`.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 2, and `_` starts from `n + 1`**. 

Since we typically don't explicitly show the initial value of the loop variable in the state, the primary focus should be on `n` and ensuring the loop condition is met.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is 3, `b` is 2**.
