Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly implement the logic to find the n-th Lucas number. According to the problem description, the function should find the n-th Lucas number, but the implementation provided returns the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number instead. 

The Lucas numbers are defined by the recurrence relation:
\[ L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) \]
with initial values \( L(0) = 2 \) and \( L(1) = 1 \).

However, the given program computes the (n+2)-th Fibonacci number, which follows a similar recurrence relation but with different initial values:
\[ F(n) = F(n-1) + F(n-2) \]
with initial values \( F(0) = 0 \) and \( F(1) = 1 \).

To correctly implement the n-th Lucas number, the program should initialize \( a \) and \( b \) to 2 and 1 respectively, and then iterate to compute the n-th Lucas number directly. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 2, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return a
```

In this corrected version, `a` will hold the n-th Lucas number after the loop completes.
