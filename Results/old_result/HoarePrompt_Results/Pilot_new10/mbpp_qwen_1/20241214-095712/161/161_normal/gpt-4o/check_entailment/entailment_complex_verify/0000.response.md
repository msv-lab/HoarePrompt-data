Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly handles the first two cases for the Lucas sequence (i.e., `func_1(0) = 2` and `func_1(1) = 1`). For any `n > 1`, the function correctly computes the `n`-th Lucas number using an iterative approach. The problem description specifies that the function should find the `n`-th Lucas number for any non-negative integer `n`. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected for the given assertions and the general logic of computing the Lucas sequence. Therefore, the original assessment was inaccurate because the program does handle the problem description correctly.
