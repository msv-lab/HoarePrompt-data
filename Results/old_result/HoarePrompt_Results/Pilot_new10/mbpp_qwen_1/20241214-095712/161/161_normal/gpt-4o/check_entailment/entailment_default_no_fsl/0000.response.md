Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided code implements a function `func_1` that calculates the n'th Lucas number. However, the problem description asks for the n'th Lucas number, but the output hints indicate that the function returns the (n-1)th Fibonacci number. Specifically:

- For `n = 0`, the Lucas number is 2, but the function returns 2, which is correct.
- For `n = 1`, the Lucas number is 1, but the function returns 1, which is correct.
- For `n = 2`, the Lucas number is 3, but the function returns 1 (the 1st Fibonacci number), which is incorrect according to the problem description.

To fix this, the function should return the nth Lucas number, not the (n-1)th Fibonacci number. The correct implementation would be:

```python
def func_1(n):
    if n == 0:
        return 2
    elif n == 1:
        return 1
    else:
        a, b = 2, 1
        for _ in range(2, n + 1):
            a, b = b, a + b
        return b
```

This ensures that the function correctly computes the nth Lucas number for all non-negative integers n.
