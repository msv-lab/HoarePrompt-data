#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join(s[i] for i in range(0, len(s), 2))
    #The program returns a string containing every second character from the original string `s`, starting from the first character
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns a string containing every second character from `s`, starting from the first character.
