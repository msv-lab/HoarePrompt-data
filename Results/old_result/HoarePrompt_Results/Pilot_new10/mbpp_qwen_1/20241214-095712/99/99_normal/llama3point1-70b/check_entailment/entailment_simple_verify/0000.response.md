Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original program logic accurately reflect the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly removes characters from the given string that have odd index values by iterating over the string and considering only characters at even indices. The annotation correctly describes the output as a string containing every second character from the original string, starting from the first character, which aligns with the problem statement. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
