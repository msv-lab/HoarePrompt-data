Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly removes characters from the given string `s` that have odd index values. The function uses list comprehension to iterate over the string and includes only characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), which matches the problem description. The assertions in the code also confirm that the function works correctly for the provided test cases. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem statement.
