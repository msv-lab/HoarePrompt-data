Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(s)` correctly removes characters with odd index values from the given string `s` by iterating over the string with a step of 2, starting from index 0. The output hints correctly describe that the function returns a string containing every second character from `s`, starting from the first character, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct based on the provided information.
