Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the characters at even indices (0-based). 

Here's why it is correct:

- The function iterates over the indices of the string `s` using a list comprehension.
- It includes only those characters where the index `i` is even (`i % 2 == 0`).
- Finally, it joins these selected characters back into a string using `''.join()`.

The provided test cases also confirm that the function behaves as expected:

- `func_1('abcdef')` returns `'ace'`.
- `func_1('python')` returns `'pto'`.
- `func_1('data')` returns `'dt'`.
- `func_1('lambs')` returns `'lms'`.

Since the program correctly removes characters at odd indices and keeps characters at even indices for all tested cases, it satisfies the problem description.
