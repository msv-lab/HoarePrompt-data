The annotated code states that the function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns a string containing every second character from the original string `s`, starting from the first character. The return postcondition also confirms this behavior. Upon analyzing the code, it appears to accurately reflect the described behavior without any missing functionality or edge cases.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and returns a string containing every second character from `s`, starting from the first character.**
