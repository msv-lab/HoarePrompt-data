Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly removes characters from the given string that have odd index values. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over the string and includes only the characters with even indices. The provided test cases in the form of assertions all pass, and the function behaves as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being **True** is accurate.
