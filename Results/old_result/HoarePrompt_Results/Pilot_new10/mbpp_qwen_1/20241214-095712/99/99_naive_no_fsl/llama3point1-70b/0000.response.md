Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` removes characters with odd index values from the given string `s` by iterating over the string with a step of 2, starting from index 0. This approach effectively keeps only the characters with even index values, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. Since the function works as expected for any string input, there are no potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.
