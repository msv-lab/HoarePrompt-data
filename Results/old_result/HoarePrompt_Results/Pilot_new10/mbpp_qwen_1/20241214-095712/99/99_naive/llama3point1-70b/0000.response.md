Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly removes characters from a given string that have odd index values. The function iterates over the string, considering only characters at even indices (0, 2, 4, ...), and concatenates them to form the new string. This logic aligns with the problem description, which asks to remove characters with odd index values. Since the program handles all cases as expected without any logical flaws or edge cases that it fails to address, it is considered correct.
