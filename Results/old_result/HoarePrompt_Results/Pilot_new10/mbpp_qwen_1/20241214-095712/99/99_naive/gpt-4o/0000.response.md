Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly removes characters from the given string that have odd index values. It iterates over the string and includes only characters with even indices in the resulting string. The examples given (`'abcdef' -> 'ace'`, `'python' -> 'pto'`, `'data' -> 'dt'`, `'lambs' -> 'lms'`) all demonstrate the correct behavior of the function. Since the function works as expected for the provided examples and the problem description, and there are no obvious edge cases that would cause it to fail, the function is correct.
