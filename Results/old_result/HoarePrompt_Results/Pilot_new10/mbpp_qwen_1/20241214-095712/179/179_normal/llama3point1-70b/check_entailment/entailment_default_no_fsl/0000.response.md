Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. It uses a generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` to generate the cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`. This aligns with the problem description which asks for the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. For example:

- When `n = 1`, the function computes the cube of 2 (the first even number), which is 8.
- When `n = 2`, the function computes the cubes of 2 and 4, which are 8 and 64 respectively, and their sum is 72.
- When `n = 3`, the function computes the cubes of 2, 4, and 6, which are 8, 64, and 216 respectively, and their sum is 288.

Since the function behaves as expected for these and other potential cases, the program is correct.
