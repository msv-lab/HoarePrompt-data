Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(n)` calculates the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers. Hereâ€™s how it works:

- It uses a generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` to generate the cubes of even numbers starting from 2 up to but not including `n * 2 + 1`.
- The `sum()` function then adds these cubes together.

Given that the problem description asks for the sum of cubes of the first `n` even natural numbers, the code satisfies this requirement. For example:
- If `n = 1`, the function computes \(2^3 = 8\).
- If `n = 2`, the function computes \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).

Since the code handles all the cases as described and there are no edge cases mentioned in the output hints that would cause the function to fail, the correctness is **True**.
