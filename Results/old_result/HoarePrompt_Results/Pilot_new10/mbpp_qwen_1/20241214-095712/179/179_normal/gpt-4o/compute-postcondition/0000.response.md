The code creates a list of even numbers by multiplying each number in the range from 1 to `n` (inclusive) by 2. This means that `even_numbers` will contain the even numbers from 2 up to `2 * n`. The initial state's value of `n` is a positive integer, and no other variables are affected.

Therefore, after executing the code, `n` remains a positive integer, and `even_numbers` is a list containing the even numbers from 2 to `2 * n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer; `even_numbers` is a list containing the even numbers from 2 to `2 * n`**
