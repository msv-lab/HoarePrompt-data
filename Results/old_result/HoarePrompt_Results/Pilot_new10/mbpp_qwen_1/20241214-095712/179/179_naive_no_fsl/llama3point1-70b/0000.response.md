Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(n)` correctly calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers. The function uses a generator expression `(i ** 3 for i in range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2))` to generate the cubes of the first `n` even numbers starting from 2. It then sums these values using the `sum()` function. 

To verify this, let's consider a few test cases:
- For `n = 1`, the first even number is 2, so the cube sum is \(2^3 = 8\).
- For `n = 2`, the first two even numbers are 2 and 4, so the cube sum is \(2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72\).

The function works correctly for these cases and handles the problem description accurately. There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to fail based on the given implementation.
