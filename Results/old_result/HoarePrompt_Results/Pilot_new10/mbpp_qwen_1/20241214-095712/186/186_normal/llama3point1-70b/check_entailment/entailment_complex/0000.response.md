Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, both of the same length, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`. This matches the problem description exactly. The use of `zip(tup1, tup2)` ensures that elements from both tuples are processed in parallel, and the generator expression `x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2)` performs the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements. The result is then converted to a tuple using the `tuple()` function. This approach works for any pair of tuples of the same length, making the function generally applicable and meeting the requirements of the problem description.
