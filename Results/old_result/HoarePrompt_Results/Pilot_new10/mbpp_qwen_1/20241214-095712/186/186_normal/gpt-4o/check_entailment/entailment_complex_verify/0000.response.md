Final: **False**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clarifies that the function `func_1` performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples. Given the problem description asks to extract the elements from the given tuples, the function does not meet the requirement. The expected behavior is to return a tuple containing the elements themselves, not their bitwise AND results. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate because the function does not fulfill the problem description requirements.
