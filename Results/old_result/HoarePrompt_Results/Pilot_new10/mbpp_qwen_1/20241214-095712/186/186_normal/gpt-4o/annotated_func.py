#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuple1 and tuple2 are tuples with the same length.
def func_1(tuple1, tuple2):
    return tuple(a & b for a, b in zip(tuple1, tuple2))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the intersection of the corresponding elements from tuple1 and tuple2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two tuples `tuple1` and `tuple2` with the same length and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements from `tuple1` and `tuple2`.
