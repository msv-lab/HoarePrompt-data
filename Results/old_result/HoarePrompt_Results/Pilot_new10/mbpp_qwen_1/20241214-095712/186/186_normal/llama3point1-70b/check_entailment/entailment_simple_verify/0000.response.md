Final: **False**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code, the program indeed performs a bitwise AND operation between the corresponding elements of the two tuples. However, the problem description asks to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples, which implies generating a Cartesian product or combinations of elements rather than performing a bitwise operation. The current implementation does not achieve this; instead, it performs a single element-wise operation. Therefore, the original assessment correctly identifies the issue, and the annotated version confirms that the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
