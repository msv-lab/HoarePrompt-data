You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to extract the elementwise and tuples from the given two tuples.
Program:
```
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple((x & y for (x, y) in zip(tup1, tup2)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` attempts to perform a bitwise AND operation between corresponding elements of two tuples using a generator expression. However, the problem description asks for "elementwise" extraction and handling of tuples, which typically means extracting elements from the tuples rather than performing operations on them.

The function's current implementation uses a bitwise AND operation (`&`), which is not what the problem description suggests. A correct approach would be to simply return the tuples themselves or extract specific elements as required by the problem description.

For example, if the problem description was to return the two tuples as they are, the function should be:

```python
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tup1, tup2
```

Since the given function does not match the described behavior and performs an unintended operation, the correctness is **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of the same length.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(x & y for x, y in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple where each element is the bitwise AND of the corresponding elements from tup1 and tup2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of the same length and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of the bitwise AND operation on the corresponding elements from `tup1` and `tup2`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
