Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided program uses the bitwise AND operator `&` between the elements of the tuples, which is not the intended operation for extracting element-wise values. The problem description asks to extract the element-wise and tuples from the given two tuples, implying a Cartesian product or combination of elements rather than a bitwise operation. 

For example, consider the input tuples `(1, 2)` and `(3, 4)`. The expected output should be `((1, 3), (1, 4), (2, 3), (2, 4))`, but the program will instead perform a bitwise AND operation, resulting in `(1 & 3, 2 & 3) = (1, 2)`, which is not the correct interpretation of the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements for the given problem.
