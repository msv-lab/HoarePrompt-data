Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns them swapped in a tuple. The assertions provided in the annotated version confirm that the function behaves as expected, swapping the two input values and returning them in the correct order. Given the problem description and the function definition, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input parameters and returns them as a tuple, meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
