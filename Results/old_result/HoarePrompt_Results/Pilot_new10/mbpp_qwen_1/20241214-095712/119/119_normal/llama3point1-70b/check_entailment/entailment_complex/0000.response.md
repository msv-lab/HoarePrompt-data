Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. The function takes two numbers `a` and `b` as input and returns a tuple containing the values of `b` followed by `a`. This exactly matches the problem description which states: "Write a function that takes in two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number and then the first number."

Since the function performs the exact operation as specified and handles all cases (as no edge cases or special conditions are involved), it satisfies the requirements of the problem description.
