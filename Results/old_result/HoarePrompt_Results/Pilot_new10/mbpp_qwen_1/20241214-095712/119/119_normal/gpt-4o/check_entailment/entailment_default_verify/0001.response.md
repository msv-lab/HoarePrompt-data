Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly swaps the order of the two input numbers and returns them as a tuple in the format `(b, a)`. The provided output hints also correctly describe the functionality of the function. Since the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description and the test cases confirm its correctness, the original assessment is accurate.
