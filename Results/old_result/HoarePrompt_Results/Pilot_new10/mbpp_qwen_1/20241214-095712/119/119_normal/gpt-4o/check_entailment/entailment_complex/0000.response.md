Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple containing `b` followed by `a`. The assertions in the annotated program confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases:

- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`

Since the function always returns a tuple with the second input value followed by the first input value, it correctly implements the described functionality for any pair of numbers (integers or floats). Therefore, the program is correct.
