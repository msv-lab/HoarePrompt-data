Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two numbers as input and returns a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number. The provided assertions confirm this behavior:

- `func_1(10, 20)` returns `(20, 10)`, which is the second number followed by the first number.
- `func_1(15, 17)` returns `(17, 15)`, which is also the second number followed by the first number.
- `func_1(100, 200)` returns `(200, 100)`, again following the pattern of the second number followed by the first number.

The function consistently produces the expected output for all tested cases, thus meeting the requirements specified in the problem description.
