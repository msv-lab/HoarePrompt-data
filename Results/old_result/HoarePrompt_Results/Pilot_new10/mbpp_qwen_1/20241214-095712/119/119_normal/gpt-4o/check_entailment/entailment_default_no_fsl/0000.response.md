Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two arguments `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple `(b, a)`. This matches the problem description exactly. The problem description asks for a function that takes two numbers and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The provided function correctly implements this behavior. The assertions in the code also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Since the function appears to work correctly for the described task and there are no hints suggesting otherwise, the code is correct.
