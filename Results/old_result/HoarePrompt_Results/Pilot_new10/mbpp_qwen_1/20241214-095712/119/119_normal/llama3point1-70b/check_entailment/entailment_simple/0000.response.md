Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two numbers (`a` and `b`) as input and returns a tuple containing `b` followed by `a`. This exactly matches the problem description, which states that the function should take in two numbers and return a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
