Let's analyze the provided annotated code and the return postconditions step by step:

### Annotated Code Analysis
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    return b, a
    # The program returns the values of `b` and `a` as a tuple
```

### Return Postconditions
The program returns the values of `b` and `a` as a tuple.

### Step-by-Step Analysis
1. **Parameters**: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which can be either integers or floats.
2. **Return Value**: The function directly returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a` in that order.
3. **Annotations**: The comment states that the function returns the values of `b` and `a` as a tuple, which aligns perfectly with the actual code.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic
- There are no complex operations or conditional statements in the function. Therefore, there are no edge cases to consider beyond the general behavior described.
- The function does exactly what it is annotated to do without any missing functionality or contradictions.

### Summary
Given the analysis, the function `func_1` simply swaps the values of `a` and `b` and returns them as a tuple.

### Functionality
**The function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which can be integers or floats, and returns a tuple containing the values of `b` and `a`.**
