Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly swaps the two input parameters and returns them as a tuple, as described in the problem statement. The provided assertions and the function implementation itself confirm that the function works as intended for any valid pair of inputs (both integers or floats). The output hints also align with this understanding, specifying that the function accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which can be integers or floats, and returns them in the order of `b` followed by `a`. There are no potential cases where this program would fail to meet the problem description under the assumption of valid input.
