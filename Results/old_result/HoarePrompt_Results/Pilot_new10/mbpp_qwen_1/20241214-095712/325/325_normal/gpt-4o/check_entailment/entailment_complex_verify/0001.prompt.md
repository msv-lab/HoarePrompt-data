You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given month number contains 30 days or not. Months are given as number from 1 to 12.
Program:
```
assert func_1(6) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(12) == False

def func_1(month: int) -> bool:
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a given month number contains 30 days. The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` which contains the numbers of the months that have 30 days: 4, 6, 9, and 11. The function returns `True` if the given month is in this set and `False` otherwise.

The function correctly handles all the test cases provided:
- For month 6, it returns `True` because June has 30 days.
- For month 2, it returns `False` because February typically does not have 30 days (it usually has 28 or 29 days).
- For month 12, it returns `False` because December does not have 30 days.

Additionally, the function will correctly handle other potential cases:
- Month 1 (January): False
- Month 3 (March): False
- Month 5 (May): False
- Month 7 (July): False
- Month 8 (August): False
- Month 10 (October): False
- Month 11 (November): False

Since the function correctly identifies months with 30 days and those without, and since no other potential cases violate the problem description, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(6) == True
assert func_1(2) == False
assert func_1(12) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer such that 1 <= month <= 12.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}
    return month in months_with_30_days
    #The program returns True if month is 4, 6, 9, or 11, otherwise returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `month` (1 ≤ month ≤ 12) and returns `True` if the month has 30 days, specifically if the month is 4, 6, 9, or 11. If the month does not match any of these, it returns `False`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
