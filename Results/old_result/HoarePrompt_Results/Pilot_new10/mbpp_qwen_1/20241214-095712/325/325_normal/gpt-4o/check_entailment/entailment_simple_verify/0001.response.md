Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly checks if a given month number contains 30 days. The function uses a set to store the month numbers that have 30 days (4, 6, 9, and 11) and returns `True` if the given month is in this set. The provided test cases (assertions) are correctly handled, and the function behaves as expected based on the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
