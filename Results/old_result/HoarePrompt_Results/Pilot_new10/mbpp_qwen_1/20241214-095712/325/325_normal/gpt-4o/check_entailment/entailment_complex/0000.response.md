Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given month number contains 30 days. The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` containing the integers 4, 6, 9, and 11, which represent April, June, September, and Novemberâ€”months that have 30 days. The function returns `True` if the input `month` is found in this set and `False` otherwise. 

The provided test cases also align with the problem description:
- `func_1(6)` returns `True`, which is correct because June has 30 days.
- `func_1(2)` returns `False`, which is correct because February does not have 30 days.
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct because December does not have 30 days.

Since the function and the test cases satisfy the problem description for all potential cases, the program is correct.
