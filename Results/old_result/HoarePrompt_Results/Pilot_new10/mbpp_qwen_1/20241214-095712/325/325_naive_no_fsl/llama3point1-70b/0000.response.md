Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program only checks if the given month number is in the list of months that have 30 days, which are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). However, it does not account for the other months. Specifically, February (2) and July (7) are not included in the list, but according to the problem description, these months do not have 30 days. Therefore, the program will incorrectly return `True` for February and July, which means it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
