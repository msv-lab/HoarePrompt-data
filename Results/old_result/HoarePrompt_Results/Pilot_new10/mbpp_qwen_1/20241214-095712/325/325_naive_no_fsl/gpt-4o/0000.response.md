Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if a given month number contains 30 days. The function uses a set `months_with_30_days` which contains the numbers of the months that have 30 days: 4, 6, 9, and 11. The function returns `True` if the given month is in this set and `False` otherwise.

The function correctly handles all the test cases provided:
- For month 6, it returns `True` because June has 30 days.
- For month 2, it returns `False` because February typically does not have 30 days (it usually has 28 or 29 days).
- For month 12, it returns `False` because December does not have 30 days.

Additionally, the function will correctly handle other potential cases:
- Month 1 (January): False
- Month 3 (March): False
- Month 5 (May): False
- Month 7 (July): False
- Month 8 (August): False
- Month 10 (October): False
- Month 11 (November): False

Since the function correctly identifies months with 30 days and those without, and since no other potential cases violate the problem description, the program is correct.
