Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the given list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list and then checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent elements is exactly 1. Additionally, it verifies that the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list, ensuring no duplicates exist. This approach correctly identifies lists with consecutive numbers, including those with duplicates, as long as they appear consecutively after sorting.

Given these steps, the function should work correctly for all potential cases of lists containing consecutive numbers. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where this function would fail based on the problem description.
