Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. It handles the following cases correctly:

1. An empty list returns `False`.
2. A list with non-consecutive integers returns `False`.
3. A list with consecutive integers returns `True`.

The function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns `False`. Then, it sorts the list and iterates through it to check if each pair of adjacent elements is consecutive. If any pair is not consecutive, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

Given the problem description and the provided assertions, the function seems to cover all necessary cases. There are no apparent edge cases or examples from the output hints that indicate the function does not work as expected.
