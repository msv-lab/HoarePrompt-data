Postcondition: ***`lst_sorted` is a list of integers where the difference between consecutive elements is either 1 or the function returns False. Specifically, if the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` is not 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function does not return anything (returns None).***
