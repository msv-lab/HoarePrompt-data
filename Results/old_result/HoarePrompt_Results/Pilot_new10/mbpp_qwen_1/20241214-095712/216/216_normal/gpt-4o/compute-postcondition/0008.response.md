Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State Analysis:**
   - `lst` is a list of integers and is not empty.
   - `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` and must have at least 2 elements.
   - The difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is 1.

2. **Loop Condition:**
   - The loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(lst_sorted) - 2`.

3. **End of Previous Iteration:**
   - We need to determine the state at the start of the next iteration.
   - At the end of the previous iteration, `i` would have been incremented by 1 from its previous value.

4. **Adjusting States:**
   - Since the loop runs from `i = 0` to `i = len(lst_sorted) - 2`, the loop will continue if `i < len(lst_sorted) - 1`.
   - Therefore, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration.
   - For the loop to execute again, `len(lst_sorted)` must remain the same because the sorting and the number of elements are not modified by the loop body (as it is omitted).

5. **Updated State:**
   - `lst` remains unchanged and is still a list of integers and is not empty.
   - `lst_sorted` remains a sorted version of `lst` and still has at least 2 elements.
   - The difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is still 1.
   - `i` is increased by 1 from its previous value.

Given these points, the state at the start of the next iteration should be:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` and must have at least 2 elements, the difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is 1, and `i` is one more than its value at the end of the previous iteration**.

However, since we only need to specify the exact values for `i` and the condition for `lst_sorted`, we can summarize it as:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` and must have at least 2 elements, the difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is 1, and `i` is the previous value of `i` + 1**.

For clarity, let's denote the previous value of `i` as `i_prev`. Then the final answer is:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers and is not empty, `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst` and must have at least 2 elements, the difference between consecutive elements in `lst_sorted` is 1, and `i` is `i_prev + 1`**.
