Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The function first checks if the list is empty and returns `False` if it is. Then, it sorts the list and iterates through it to ensure that each consecutive pair of elements has a difference of 1. If any pair does not meet this condition, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. For example:
- An empty list returns `False`.
- A list with non-consecutive numbers (e.g., `[1, 2, 1]`) returns `False`.
- A list with consecutive numbers (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`) returns `True`.
- A list with consecutive numbers but missing one (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]`) returns `False`.

Since the code matches the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
