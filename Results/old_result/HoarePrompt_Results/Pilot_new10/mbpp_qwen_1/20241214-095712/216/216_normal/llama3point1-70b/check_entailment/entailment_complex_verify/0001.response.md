Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers by ensuring the list is sorted and each element is exactly one greater than the previous, while also ensuring all elements are unique. The original assessment correctly identified that the function meets the requirements of the problem description. The annotated code provides additional clarity but does not alter the correctness of the function as per the problem statement.
