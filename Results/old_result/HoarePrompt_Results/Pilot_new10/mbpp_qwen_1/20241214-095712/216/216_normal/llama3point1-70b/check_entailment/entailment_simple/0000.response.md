Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The given Python function `func_1(lst)` correctly implements the requirement to check whether the given list `lst` contains consecutive numbers. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Sorting the List**: 
   - The line `lst.sort()` sorts the list in ascending order. This step ensures that if the list contains consecutive numbers, they will be adjacent after sorting.

2. **Checking Consecutive Numbers**:
   - The line `return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))` checks if each element in the sorted list is exactly one greater than its predecessor. This condition ensures that the numbers are consecutive.

3. **Checking Uniqueness**:
   - The line `and len(lst) == len(set(lst))` checks if all elements in the list are unique. The length of the list should be equal to the length of the set of the list, which contains only unique elements.

4. **Combining Conditions**:
   - The function returns `True` if both conditions (consecutive and unique) are satisfied, otherwise it returns `False`.

### Why it is Correct:
- The function first sorts the list, ensuring that any consecutive sequence will be checked sequentially.
- It then verifies that each number is exactly one greater than the previous one, which ensures consecutiveness.
- Finally, it checks that all elements are unique, which prevents cases like `[1, 2, 2, 3]` from being considered as consecutive.

This implementation meets the problem description for all possible cases where the input list can contain consecutive numbers. Therefore, the program is correct.
