Let's analyze the given annotated code step by step to determine the functionality of the function `func_1`.

### Step-by-Step Analysis:

1. **Initial State**: `lst` is a list of integers.
2. **Empty List Check**:
   - If `lst` is empty (`if (not lst)`), the function returns `False`.
   - **State after the if block**: `lst` is a non-empty list of integers.
3. **Sorting the List**:
   - The list is sorted into `lst_sorted`.
   - **State after sorting**: `lst_sorted` is a sorted version of `lst`.
4. **Checking Consecutive Integers**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted list and checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive elements is exactly 1.
   - If any pair does not satisfy this condition, the function immediately returns `False`.
   - **State after the for loop**: If no discrepancies are found, the function proceeds to the next line.
5. **Final Return**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any discrepancies, the function returns `True`.

### Potential Edge Cases and Missing Logic:
- The annotations suggest that the function will return `False` in all cases where the list is not empty and the elements are not consecutive integers. However, the actual code only returns `False` if it finds a discrepancy during the iteration. If the list is empty or if the list contains consecutive integers, the function returns `True`.
- There are no missing functionalities in the code as far as the logic described.

### Functionality Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `True` if the list is a sequence of consecutive integers. If the list is empty or if it contains integers that are not consecutive, the function returns `False`.

### Final Answer:
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers and returns `True` if the list contains consecutive integers. If the list is empty or contains non-consecutive integers, it returns `False`.**
