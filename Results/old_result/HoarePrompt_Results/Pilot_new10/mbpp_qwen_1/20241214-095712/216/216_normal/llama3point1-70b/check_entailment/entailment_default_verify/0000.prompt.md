You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if the given list contains consecutive numbers. It first sorts the list and then checks if the difference between each pair of adjacent elements is exactly 1. Additionally, it verifies that the length of the list is equal to the length of the set of the list, ensuring no duplicates exist. This approach correctly identifies lists with consecutive numbers, including those with duplicates, as long as they appear consecutively after sorting.

Given these steps, the function should work correctly for all potential cases of lists containing consecutive numbers. There are no obvious edge cases or scenarios where this function would fail based on the problem description.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns True if the list is sorted and consecutive with all unique elements, otherwise it returns False. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
