Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the original assessment, the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a given list contains consecutive numbers. The function handles various scenarios such as empty lists, lists with duplicates but in consecutive order, and lists with non-consecutive numbers. The provided test cases and the logic within the function confirm that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
