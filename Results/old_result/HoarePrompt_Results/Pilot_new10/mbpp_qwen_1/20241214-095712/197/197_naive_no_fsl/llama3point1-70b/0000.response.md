Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` attempts to count the occurrences of elements from the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`. However, it has a critical issue: it returns the total count of all elements from `lst` found in `tup`, rather than returning a dictionary with each element's count.

For example, consider the following inputs:
- `tup = (1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 2)` and `lst = [2, 3]`

The function will return `5` because there are three `2`s and two `3`s in the tuple, but the expected output according to the problem description would be a dictionary like `{2: 3, 3: 2}`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case, hence the correctness is **False**.
