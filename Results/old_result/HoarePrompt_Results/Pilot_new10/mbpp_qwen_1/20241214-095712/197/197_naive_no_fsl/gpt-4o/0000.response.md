Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of elements from the list in the given tuple. Let's analyze the function:

1. The function iterates over each element in the `elements` list.
2. For each element, it uses the `count` method to find how many times that element appears in the tuple `tup`.
3. It sums up these counts using a generator expression within the `sum` function.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- First test case: `assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3` (counts 'a' twice and 'b' once)
- Second test case: `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6` (counts '1' three times, '4' twice, and '7' once)
- Third test case: `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2` (counts '1' once and '2' once)

Since the function handles these cases correctly and the logic seems sound, we can conclude that the function works as expected for the given problem description and the provided test cases. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail based on the provided information.
