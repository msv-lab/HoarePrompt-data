Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` returns the sum of counts of elements from `lst` that are present in `tup`, which aligns with the output hints. The function does not return a dictionary with each element's count as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
