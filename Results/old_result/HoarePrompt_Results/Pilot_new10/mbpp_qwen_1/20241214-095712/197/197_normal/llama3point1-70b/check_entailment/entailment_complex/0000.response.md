Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a tuple `tup` and a list `lst` as input parameters. The function then iterates over each element in the list `lst` and uses the `count` method to find how many times each element appears in the tuple `tup`. It sums up these counts and returns the result. 

This approach ensures that the function will count the occurrences of all elements from the list `lst` within the tuple `tup`, including repeated elements and accounting for the fact that if an element in `lst` is not found in `tup`, its count is considered as 0. This matches the requirement specified in the problem description accurately for all potential cases.
