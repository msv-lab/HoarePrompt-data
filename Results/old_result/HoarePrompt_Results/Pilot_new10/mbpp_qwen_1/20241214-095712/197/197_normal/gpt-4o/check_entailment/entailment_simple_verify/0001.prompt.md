You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to count the occurence of all elements of list in a tuple.
Program:
```
assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2

def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum((tup.count(element) for element in elements))
    return count


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of elements from the list in the given tuple. Let's analyze the function:

1. The function iterates over each element in the `elements` list.
2. For each element, it uses the `count` method to find how many times that element appears in the tuple `tup`.
3. It sums up these counts using a generator expression within the `sum` function.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
- First test case: `assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3` (counts 'a' twice and 'b' once)
- Second test case: `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6` (counts '1' three times, '4' twice, and '7' once)
- Third test case: `assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2` (counts '1' once and '2' once)

Since the function handles these cases correctly and the logic seems sound, we can conclude that the function works as expected for the given problem description and the provided test cases. There are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail based on the provided information.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(('a', 'a', 'c', 'b', 'd'), ['a', 'b']) == 3
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 1, 4, 6, 7, 1, 4), [1, 4, 7]) == 6
assert func_1((1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6), [1, 2]) == 2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple, and elements is a list of elements to count within the tuple.
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum(tup.count(element) for element in elements)
    return count
    #The program returns count which is the total number of occurrences of all elements from list 'elements' in tuple 'tup'


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
