Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method. This method iterates over the tuple and returns the number of times the specified element appears. Since the function behaves as expected for any valid input (a tuple and an element), there are no cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
