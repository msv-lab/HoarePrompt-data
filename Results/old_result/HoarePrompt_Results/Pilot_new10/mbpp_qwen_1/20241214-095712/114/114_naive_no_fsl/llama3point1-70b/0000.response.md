Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement by using the built-in `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element in the given tuple. This method works for all possible inputs, including empty tuples, tuples with repeated elements, and tuples with the specified element present or absent. Since the function behaves as expected in all cases, the program is correct.
