Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`. It returns the number of times `elem` appears in `tup` using the built-in method `count()`, which precisely fulfills the requirement of counting occurrences of an element in a tuple. Since the function behaves as expected for all possible tuples and elements (as long as `elem` is hashable, which is a precondition mentioned in the problem description), the program is correct.
