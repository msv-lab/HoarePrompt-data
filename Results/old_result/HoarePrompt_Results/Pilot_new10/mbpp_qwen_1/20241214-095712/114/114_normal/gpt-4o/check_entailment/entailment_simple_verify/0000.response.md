Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The annotated code clarifies that the function takes a tuple and an element as input and returns the count of how many times the element appears in the tuple. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected. Since the problem description does not specify that the function should only work with tuples and not other iterable types, the current implementation is correct. The original assessment was based on a misunderstanding of the problem description, as the provided examples and annotations indicate that the function is working as intended.
