Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment was accurate because the function `func_1` does not handle the case where the tuple is empty and the element is not present in the tuple. Although the provided test cases cover some scenarios, the function should still handle edge cases gracefully. For example, if the tuple is `()` (an empty tuple) and the element is `10`, the function should return `0`. Since the function does not explicitly handle this case, it is not fully robust according to the problem description. Therefore, the correctness is **False**.
