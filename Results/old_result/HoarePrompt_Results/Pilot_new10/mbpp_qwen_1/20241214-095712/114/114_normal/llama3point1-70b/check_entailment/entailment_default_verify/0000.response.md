Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to count the occurrences of an element in a tuple using the built-in `count` method. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a tuple and a hashable object, and returns the number of times the object appears in the tuple. Given that the provided code meets the problem description and the output hints do not indicate any issues, the original assessment is correct.
