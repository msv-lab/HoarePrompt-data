Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element as input parameters and returns the count of how many times the element appears in the tuple. This is exactly what the problem description asked for. The function uses the built-in `count` method of tuples, which returns the number of occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. The provided test cases also correctly validate this behavior. Therefore, the program is correct and always follows the problem description.
