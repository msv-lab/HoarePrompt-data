Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string according to the problem description. Hereâ€™s why:

1. **Problem Description**: Convert a snake case string to a camel case string.
2. **Program Behavior**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a single argument `snake_case_str`.
   - It splits the input string by underscores (`_`), resulting in a list of words.
   - Each word in the list is capitalized using the `capitalize()` method.
   - These capitalized words are then joined back together without any separators to form the camel case string.
   - Finally, the function returns this camel case string.

Since the program processes each word in the snake case string by capitalizing it and joining them together without any separator, it accurately performs the conversion from snake case to camel case as specified in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
