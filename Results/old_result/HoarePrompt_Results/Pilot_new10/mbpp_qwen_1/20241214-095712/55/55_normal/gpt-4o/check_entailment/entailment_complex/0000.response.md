Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It meets the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases:

1. The function `func_1` accepts a string `snake_str` that contains only lowercase letters and underscores.
2. It splits the input string by underscores (`snake_str.split('_')`), resulting in a list of substrings.
3. Each substring is then capitalized using a generator expression within the `join` method (`x.capitalize()`).
4. Finally, the capitalized substrings are joined together without any separators, producing the desired camel case string.

The provided assertions also confirm that the function works as expected for different inputs, further validating its correctness according to the problem description.
