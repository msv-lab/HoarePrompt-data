Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It splits the string by underscores, capitalizes each component, and joins them together without any separators. This matches the problem description and the examples given:

- For `'python_program'`, the function returns `'PythonProgram'`.
- For `'python_language'`, the function returns `'PythonLanguage'`.
- For `'programming_language'`, the function returns `'ProgrammingLanguage'`.

The function handles all potential cases where the input string consists of lowercase letters and underscores, and it processes each component appropriately by capitalizing the first letter of each component and removing the underscores. Therefore, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case.
