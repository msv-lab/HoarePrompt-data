Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly converts a snake case string to a camel case string. It handles edge cases such as an empty string, a string with only underscores, and a string with no underscores appropriately. The function splits the input string by underscores, capitalizes each resulting word, and joins them together, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
