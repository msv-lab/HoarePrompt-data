#State of the program right berfore the function call: snake_str is a string containing only lowercase letters and underscores.
def func_1(snake_str):
    components = snake_str.split('_')
    return ''.join(x.capitalize() for x in components)
    #The program returns a string where each substring in 'components' is capitalized and joined together without any separators
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `snake_str` containing only lowercase letters and underscores, splits the string into components based on underscores, capitalizes each component, and returns a new string with these capitalized components joined together without any separators.
