`snake_case_str` is split into a list of words using the underscore ('_') as the delimiter. This means that each word in the original string, separated by underscores, will become a separate element in the `words` list. The original value of `snake_case_str` is lost, but the resulting list of words is stored in `words`.

Output State: **`words` is a list of strings obtained by splitting `snake_case_str` at each underscore, `snake_case_str` is no longer available**
