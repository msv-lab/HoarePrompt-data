Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly converts snake case strings to camel case strings for the given test cases and appears to handle the conversion logic appropriately. It splits the snake case string by underscores, capitalizes each component, and joins them together without any additional characters. Given the provided assertions and the general structure of the function, it seems to meet the requirements for converting snake case to camel case in all observed cases.
