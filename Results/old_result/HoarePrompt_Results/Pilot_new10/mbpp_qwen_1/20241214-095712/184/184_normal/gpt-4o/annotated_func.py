#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]
    #The program returns a list of odd numbers from the original list 'nums'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list.
