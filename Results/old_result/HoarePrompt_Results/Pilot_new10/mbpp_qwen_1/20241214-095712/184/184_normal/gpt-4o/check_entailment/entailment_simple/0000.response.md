Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the function to filter odd numbers. The function `func_1` takes a list of integers as input and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. This matches the problem description, which states: "Write a function to filter odd numbers."

The provided test cases confirm the function's behavior:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`: This returns the expected list of odd numbers from the input list.
2. `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]) == [45, 67, 93]`: Again, the function correctly filters out the even numbers, returning only the odd ones.
3. `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]) == [5, 7, 9, 3]`: The function filters out the even numbers (8, 6, 4) and keeps the odd numbers (5, 7, 9, 3).

The list comprehension inside the function iterates through each number in the input list and includes it in the result list only if the number is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). This ensures that the function behaves as specified in the problem description for any list of integers.
