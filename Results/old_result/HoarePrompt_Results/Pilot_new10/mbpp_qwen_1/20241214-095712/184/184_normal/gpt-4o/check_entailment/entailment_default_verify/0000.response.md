Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1` correctly filters out the odd numbers from the input list as described in the problem statement. The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list and includes it in the result list only if it is not divisible by 2 (i.e., it is odd). The output hints provided also confirm that the function accepts a list of integers and returns a new list containing only the odd numbers from the original list. There are no issues with edge cases or invalid inputs as per the given problem description and assumptions.
