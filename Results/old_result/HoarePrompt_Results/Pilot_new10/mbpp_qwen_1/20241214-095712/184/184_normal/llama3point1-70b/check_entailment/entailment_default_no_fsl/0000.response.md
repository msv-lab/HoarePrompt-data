Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(nums)` filters out even numbers and returns a list of odd numbers. This matches the problem description which asks for a function to filter odd numbers. The list comprehension `[num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]` correctly checks each number in the input list `nums` to see if it is odd (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). Since this logic works for all integer inputs, the function correctly filters odd numbers for every potential case.
