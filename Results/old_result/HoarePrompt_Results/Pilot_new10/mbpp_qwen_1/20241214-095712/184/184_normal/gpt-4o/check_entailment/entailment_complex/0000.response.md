Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly filters out even numbers from the input list and returns a list containing only the odd numbers. This is consistent with the problem description which states that the function should filter odd numbers. 

The function uses a list comprehension to iterate over each number in the input list `nums` and includes it in the result list only if the number is not divisible by 2 (i.e., `num % 2 != 0`). This ensures that all even numbers are excluded, and only odd numbers are included in the output list.

The provided test cases also validate that the function works as expected for different inputs, further confirming its correctness according to the problem description.
