Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` filters out even numbers from a list and keeps only the odd numbers. The code uses a list comprehension to iterate over the input list `nums` and includes only those numbers that satisfy the condition `num % 2 != 0`, which checks if a number is odd. The provided assertions cover different scenarios, including lists with multiple odd and even numbers, lists with only odd or even numbers, and lists with a mix of odd and even numbers. Since the function behaves as expected in all given examples, we can conclude that the code works correctly for every potential case based on the problem description.
