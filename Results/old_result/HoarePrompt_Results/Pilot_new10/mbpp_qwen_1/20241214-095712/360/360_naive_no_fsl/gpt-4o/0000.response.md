Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum of elements. The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and iterates through each sublist, calculating its sum. If the sum of the current sublist is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist. The assertions provided also cover various cases, including a single sublist and multiple sublists with different sums. Since the function works as expected for the provided examples and there are no apparent logical flaws or edge cases that are not handled, the program is correct.
