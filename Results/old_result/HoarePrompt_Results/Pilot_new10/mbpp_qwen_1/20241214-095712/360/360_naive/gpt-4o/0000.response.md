Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. The function initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and iterates through each sublist, calculating its sum. If the sum of the current sublist is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist. Finally, it returns the sublist with the highest sum.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
1. A list containing multiple sublists with different sums.
2. A list containing sublists with similar sums.
3. A list containing only one sublist.

In all these cases, the function works as expected and returns the correct result. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem description.
