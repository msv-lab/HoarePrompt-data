To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's break down the given conditions and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

### Given Conditions:
- `list_of_lists` must have at least one sublist.
- If the sum of the elements in the first sublist (`current_sum`) is greater than the current `max_sum`, then `max_sum` is updated to `current_sum` and `max_list` is set to the first sublist in `list_of_lists`.
- Otherwise, `max_sum` and `max_list` remain unchanged.

### State at the End of the Previous Iteration:
- The exact values of `max_sum` and `max_list` are not specified, but we know they might or might not have been updated based on the first sublist.
- The key point is that the loop must check if there are more sublists in `list_of_lists` to process.

### Analysis:
- For the loop to continue, there must be at least one more sublist in `list_of_lists` after the first one.
- The variables `max_sum` and `max_list` may have been updated based on the first sublist, but this does not affect the condition for continuing the loop.

### Step-by-Step Reasoning:
1. **Check the Condition for Loop Execution**: The loop continues as long as there are sublists left in `list_of_lists`.
2. **Current State**: We know that `list_of_lists` must have at least one sublist, but we need to ensure there is at least one more sublist for the loop to execute again.

### Conclusion:
Since the loop needs to check the next sublist, `list_of_lists` must have at least two sublists. This ensures that after checking the first sublist, there is still at least one more sublist to process.

### Updated State:
State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least two sublists**.

So, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least two sublists**.
