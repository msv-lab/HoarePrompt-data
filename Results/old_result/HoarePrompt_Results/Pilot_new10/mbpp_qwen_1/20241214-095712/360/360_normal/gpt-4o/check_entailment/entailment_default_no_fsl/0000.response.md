Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code iterates through each sublist in the input list_of_lists, calculates the sum of each sublist, and keeps track of the sublist with the maximum sum. If the input list_of_lists is empty, the function correctly returns an empty list, as implied by the output hints. The assertions provided in the problem description also confirm that the function works correctly for the given examples. Therefore, the code appears to meet the requirements for every potential case.
