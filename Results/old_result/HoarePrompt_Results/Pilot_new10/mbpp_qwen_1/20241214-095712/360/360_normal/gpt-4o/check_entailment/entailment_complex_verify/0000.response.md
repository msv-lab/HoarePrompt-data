Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the list with the highest sum of elements from a list of lists. The annotated version confirms that the function iterates through each sublist, calculates its sum, and updates the maximum sum and corresponding list accordingly. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and demonstrate the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
