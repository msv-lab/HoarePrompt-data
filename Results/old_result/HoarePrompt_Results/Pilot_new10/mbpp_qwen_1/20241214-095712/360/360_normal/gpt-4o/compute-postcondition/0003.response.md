The code assigns the sum of the elements in `sublist` to `current_sum`. The `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`. The value of `current_sum` is now the sum of the elements in `sublist`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` must have at least one sublist, `max_sum` is -inf, `max_list` is an empty list, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`**
