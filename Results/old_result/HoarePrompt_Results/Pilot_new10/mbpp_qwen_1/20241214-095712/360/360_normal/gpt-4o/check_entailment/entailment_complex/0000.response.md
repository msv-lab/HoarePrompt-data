Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it meets the requirements:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should return the list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest.
2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The function `func_1` takes a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists of integers.
   - It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity to ensure any list sum will be larger.
   - A variable `max_list` is initialized to an empty list to store the sublist with the highest sum.
   - The function iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`.
   - For each sublist, it calculates the sum of its elements.
   - If the current sublist's sum is greater than `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` and sets `max_list` to the current sublist.
   - After iterating through all sublists, it returns `max_list`.

The assertions provided in the comments also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different input cases:
- It correctly handles a list of multiple sublists with varying sums.
- It correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum when there is a single sublist.
- It handles the edge case of an empty `list_of_lists` (though no explicit check is needed since an empty list will result in `max_sum` remaining at negative infinity, and thus returning an empty list).

Since the program correctly identifies and returns the sublist with the highest sum for all possible inputs, the program is correct according to the problem description.
