Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement by using the `max` function with `key=sum`. This ensures that the sublist with the highest sum of elements is returned. Since the function works correctly for all potential cases (it handles lists of lists with varying sizes and integer values), and the output hints match the functionality of the code, the program is correct.
