The code initializes an empty list `max_list`. The value of `max_sum` remains unchanged as `-inf`, and the structure of `list_of_lists` also remains the same. Therefore, the only change is in the creation of the new list `max_list`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `max_sum` is -inf, `max_list` is an empty list**
