Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists of integers, `max_sum` is the maximum sum among all sublists, `max_list` is the sublist with the maximum sum.** 

Explanation:
- The loop iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`.
- For each sublist, it calculates the sum of its elements (`current_sum`).
- It compares `current_sum` with `max_sum` and updates `max_sum` and `max_list` if `current_sum` is greater than `max_sum`.

After the loop completes, `max_sum` will hold the highest sum found among all sublists, and `max_list` will be the sublist that corresponds to this maximum sum. If no sublists are present in `list_of_lists`, `max_sum` will remain `-inf` (or the original value), and `max_list` will remain an empty list.
