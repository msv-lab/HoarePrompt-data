Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the `set` data structure to remove duplicate elements from the list, and then calculates the sum of the remaining unique elements using the `sum` function. This approach is correct for finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The provided test cases cover different scenarios, including lists with duplicates and lists without duplicates, and the function passes all these tests. Since the function works correctly for the given examples and the logic is sound, it should handle all potential cases as expected.
