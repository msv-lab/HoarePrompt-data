Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code sums the unique elements of a list using `sum(set(lst))`. This approach works correctly for the given test cases and handles various scenarios:
- It correctly sums the non-repeated elements in a list with duplicates (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]` results in `21`).
- It correctly sums the non-repeated elements in a list with multiple occurrences of some numbers (e.g., `[1, 10, 9, 4, 2, 10, 10, 45, 4]` results in `71`).
- It correctly sums the non-repeated elements in a list with fewer unique elements (e.g., `[12, 10, 9, 45, 2, 10, 10, 45, 10]` results in `78`).

Since the function behaves as expected for the given test cases and the problem description, it is correct for every potential case described.
