Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It uses a generator expression within the `sum()` function to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst` and includes only those elements that appear exactly once in the list (`lst.count(i) == 1`). This ensures that only non-repeated elements are summed. The function handles all potential cases correctly, including an empty list, where it would return 0, and lists with multiple elements, where it correctly sums the non-repeated ones. Thus, the code satisfies the requirements for every potential case.
