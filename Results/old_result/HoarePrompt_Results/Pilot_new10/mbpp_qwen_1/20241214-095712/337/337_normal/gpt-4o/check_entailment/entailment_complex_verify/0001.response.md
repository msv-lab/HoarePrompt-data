Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` uses the `set` data structure to remove duplicate elements from the list and then calculates the sum of the remaining unique elements using the `sum` function. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, and the function passes them. The annotated version confirms that the function handles cases where the list is empty, contains duplicates, or already consists of unique elements. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program is correct based on the problem description.
