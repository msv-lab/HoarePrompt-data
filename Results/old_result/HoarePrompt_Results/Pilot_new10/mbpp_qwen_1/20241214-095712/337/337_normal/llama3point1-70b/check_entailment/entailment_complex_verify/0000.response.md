Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code aligns with the problem description and the original assessment. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. The generator expression filters out elements that appear exactly once using `lst.count(i) == 1`, and then the `sum()` function adds these unique elements together. The explanation in the original assessment accurately reflects the functionality and correctness of the program.
