Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. Here's why:

1. The function takes a list of integers as input (`lst`).
2. It converts the list to a set using `set(lst)`, which automatically removes all duplicate elements, ensuring that only unique elements remain.
3. It then uses the `sum()` function to calculate the sum of these unique elements.
4. The provided test cases verify that the function works correctly for different scenarios, including lists with duplicates, empty lists, and lists with unique elements.

Since the function meets the problem description by accurately calculating the sum of non-repeated elements in any given list, the program is correct.
