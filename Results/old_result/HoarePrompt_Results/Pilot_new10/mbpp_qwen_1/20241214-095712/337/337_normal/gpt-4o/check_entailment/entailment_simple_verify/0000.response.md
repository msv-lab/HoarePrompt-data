Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` takes a list as input and returns the sum of its unique elements by converting it to a set. The provided assertions correctly validate the function against different inputs, and the logic appears sound. The annotated version confirms that the program correctly handles the general case of finding the sum of non-repeated elements in a list, without any issues noted in the original assessment.
