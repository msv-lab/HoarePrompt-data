Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. It calculates the sum of non-repeated (unique) elements in a given list of integers. Here's why:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function accepts a list of integers (`lst`) and returns the sum of all unique integers in the list. An integer is considered unique if it appears exactly once in the list.

2. **Implementation**: 
   - The function uses a generator expression `i for i in lst if lst.count(i) == 1` to iterate over each element `i` in the list `lst`.
   - `lst.count(i) == 1` checks if the element `i` appears exactly once in the list.
   - The `sum()` function then adds up all the unique elements.

3. **Edge Cases**:
   - If the list is empty (`[]`), the generator expression will evaluate to an empty sequence, and `sum([])` returns `0`, which is correct.
   - If all elements are duplicates, the generator expression will still evaluate to an empty sequence because no element will satisfy `lst.count(i) == 1`, and again `sum([])` returns `0`, which is correct.

Therefore, the function always meets the requirements of the problem description for any potential input case.
