Postcondition: ***`i` is an odd integer, and `sum` is the original sum plus `math.comb(n, i)`. Since the if condition checks if `i % 2 == 0`, which would make `i` an even integer, the if part does not execute. Therefore, the overall postcondition remains the same as the precondition, where `i` is an odd integer and `sum` includes the combination term for the original `i`.***
