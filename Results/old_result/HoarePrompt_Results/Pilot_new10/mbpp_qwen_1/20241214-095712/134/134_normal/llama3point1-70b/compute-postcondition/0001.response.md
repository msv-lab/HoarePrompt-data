Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Identify the Variables Involved in the Loop Condition:**
   - The loop condition is `i in range(n + 1)`.
   - This means the loop will iterate from `i = 0` to `i = n`.

2. **Determine the Initial State of the Variables:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (as given in the state).
   - `sum` is 0 (as given in the state).

3. **Analyze the Loop Execution:**
   - For the loop to start executing, the range function needs to generate valid values for `i`.
   - The range function `range(n + 1)` generates numbers from `0` to `n` inclusive.

4. **Identify Necessary Adjustments:**
   - Since `n` is a positive integer, the loop can start executing if `n` is at least 1.
   - The initial value of `i` will be `0`, as the loop starts from `0` and increments up to `n`.

5. **Formulate the Final State:**
   - The state before the loop should include `n` being a positive integer and `i` starting at `0`.

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `n` must be a positive integer.
- `i` must be `0`.

**Final State:**
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0**
