The code updates the value of `sum` by adding `math.comb(n, i)` to it. Since `i` is an odd integer and `sum` was originally the original sum plus `math.comb(n, i)`, the new value of `sum` will be the original sum plus `math.comb(n, i)` plus another `math.comb(n, i)`. Therefore, the new value of `sum` is the original sum plus twice `math.comb(n, i)`. The value of `i` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is an odd integer, and `sum` is the original sum plus twice `math.comb(n, i)`**
