Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code appears to correctly implement the function described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` and calculates the sum of the binomial coefficients for even indices from 0 to `n`. The binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` is added to the sum only if `i` is even. The loop iterates through all integers from 0 to `n`, checking the parity of each index and including the corresponding binomial coefficient in the sum if the index is even.

Since the problem description and the output hints clearly state that the function should return the sum of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even `i` from 0 to `n`, and the code exactly matches this requirement, the program is correct for every potential case.
