Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function `func_1(n)` which calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer `n`. The loop iterates through all integers from 0 to `n`, checks if the index `i` is even using `if i % 2 == 0`, and if so, adds the value of `math.comb(n, i)` to the sum. This matches the problem description exactly, and the output hints also confirm this behavior. There are no known edge cases or inputs where this code would fail to meet the requirements as described.
