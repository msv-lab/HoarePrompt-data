Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). The program iterates through each index from 0 to \( n \), checks if the index is even, and if so, adds the corresponding binomial coefficient to the sum. This logic aligns with the problem description and should work correctly for all positive integers \( n \). There are no obvious edge cases or potential scenarios where this program would fail based on the given problem statement.
