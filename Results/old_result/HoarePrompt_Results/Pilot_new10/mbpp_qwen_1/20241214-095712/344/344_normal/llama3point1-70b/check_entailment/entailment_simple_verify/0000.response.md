Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function is correct, but upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it appears that the function does not always return the correct insertion point. Specifically, the function returns the index `i` where `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`, but it should return the smallest index `i` such that `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`. For example, if `value` is between the first and second elements of `sorted_list`, the function returns 1, which is not the smallest index. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate.
