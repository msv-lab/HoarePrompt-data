Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. Here's a detailed breakdown:

1. **Function Signature**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `sorted_list`, which is a list of integers or floats already sorted in non-decreasing order, and `value`, which is also an integer or float.

2. **Loop Logic**: The function uses a `for` loop to iterate through the elements of `sorted_list`. It checks each element to see if it is greater than or equal to the specified `value`. When it finds an element that meets this condition, it immediately returns the current index `i`.

3. **Return Behavior**:
   - If no element in `sorted_list` is greater than or equal to `value`, the loop will complete without finding a suitable index. In this case, the function returns `len(sorted_list)`, indicating that `value` should be inserted at the end of the list to maintain the sorted order.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `value` is less than all elements in `sorted_list`, the function correctly returns `len(sorted_list)`.
   - If `value` is equal to one of the elements in `sorted_list`, the function correctly returns the index of that element.
   - If `value` is greater than all elements in `sorted_list`, the function correctly returns `len(sorted_list)`.

Since the function accurately implements the logic required to find the right insertion point, it adheres to the problem description in all cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
