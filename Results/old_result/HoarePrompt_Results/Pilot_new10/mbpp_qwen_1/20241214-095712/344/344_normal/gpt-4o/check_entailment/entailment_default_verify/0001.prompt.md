You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses `bisect.bisect_right` from the `bisect` module, which correctly finds the insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The function returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain sorted order. The provided test cases cover different scenarios:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` returns `4`, which is correct because `6` should be inserted at index `4`.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` returns `2`, which is correct because `3` should be inserted at index `2`.
3. `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)` returns `4`, which is correct because `7` should also be inserted at index `4`.

Since `bisect_right` handles edge cases and the provided examples cover typical usage, the function appears to meet the requirements for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a sorted list `sorted_list` of integers or floats and a value. It returns the index in `sorted_list` where the `value` would fit to maintain the sorted order. This index is the rightmost position where the value can be inserted without violating the sorted order of the list. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
