Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. It iterates through the list and returns the index where the specified value should be inserted to maintain the sorted order, or the length of the list if the value is greater than all elements in the list. This matches the problem description and handles all potential cases, including when the value is less than the first element, between two elements, or greater than the last element.
