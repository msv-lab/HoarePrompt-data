Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` uses the `bisect_right` method from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. 

- The function signature `def func_1(sorted_list, value)` matches the requirement that the function should take a sorted list and a value as inputs.
- The use of `bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)` ensures that the returned index is the position where the value can be inserted while maintaining the list's sorted order. Specifically, `bisect_right` returns the index where the value should be inserted to maintain the list in sorted order, ensuring the list remains sorted after the insertion.
- The provided test cases (`assert` statements) verify that the function works correctly for different scenarios:
  - When the value `6` is greater than any element in the list `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, it correctly returns `4`.
  - When the value `3` is between elements `2` and `4`, it correctly returns `2`.
  - When the value `7` is greater than all elements in the list, it correctly returns `4`.

Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
