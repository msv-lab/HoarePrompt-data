Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a sorted list (`sorted_list`) and a value, and it uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for the value in the sorted list. The `bisect_right` function returns the index where the value should be inserted to keep the list sorted, which aligns with the requirement to locate the right insertion point for the specified value in sorted order. The provided assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected for different input cases. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all potential cases.
