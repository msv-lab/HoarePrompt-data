You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. For each element in the list, it checks if the current element is greater than or equal to the specified value. If it finds such an element, it returns the index. If no such element is found (i.e., all elements are less than the specified value), it returns the length of the list, which is the correct position to insert the value to maintain sorted order. This logic handles all potential cases without any missing conditions or edge cases.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer or float.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order, `value` is an integer or float, `i` is the smallest index in `sorted_list` such that `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`, and if no such index exists, `i` is the length of `sorted_list`.
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the length of the list 'sorted_list'

### Analysis

1. **Parameters**:
   - `sorted_list`: A list of integers or floats that is already sorted in non-decreasing order.
   - `value`: An integer or float.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The function iterates through each element in `sorted_list` using a for loop.
   - Inside the loop, it checks if the current element `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`.
   - If such an element is found, the function immediately returns the index `i`.
   - If the loop completes without finding such an element, the function returns the length of `sorted_list`.

3. **Annotations**:
   - The annotations suggest multiple possible return values (0, 1, 2, or the length of `sorted_list`).
   - However, the actual code only returns the index `i` where `sorted_list[i] >= value` or the length of `sorted_list` if no such index exists.

4. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - If `value` is less than the first element of `sorted_list`, the function should return 0.
   - If `value` is greater than or equal to the first element but less than the second element, the function should return 1.
   - If `value` is greater than or equal to the last element, the function should return the length of `sorted_list`.

### Summary

Based on the code and the actual behavior, the function `func_1` accepts a sorted list `sorted_list` and a value, and returns the smallest index `i` such that `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`. If no such index exists, it returns the length of the list.

### Functionality

**The function accepts a sorted list `sorted_list` and a value, and returns the smallest index `i` such that `sorted_list[i]` is greater than or equal to `value`. If no such index exists, it returns the length of the list.**

This summary covers all potential cases and reflects the actual behavior of the function.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
