Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program uses the `bisect_right` function from the `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The `bisect_right` function returns the index where the value would be inserted to keep the list sorted. This matches the requirement to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The provided test cases also confirm that the function works correctly for the given inputs. Since the function behaves as expected for the given examples and the problem description, and there are no obvious edge cases or issues identified, the program is correct.
