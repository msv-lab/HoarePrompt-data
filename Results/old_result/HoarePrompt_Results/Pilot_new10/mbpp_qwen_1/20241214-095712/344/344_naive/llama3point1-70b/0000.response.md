Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic for finding the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. It iterates through the list and returns the index where the value would fit while maintaining the sorted order. If the value is greater than all elements in the list, it returns the length of the list, which is the correct position to insert the value to keep the list sorted. This function works correctly for all potential cases without any missing logic or edge cases.
