Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list (`list1`) with the elements of the second list (`list2`). This behavior aligns with the problem description. The function handles both cases where `list1` is not empty and where it is empty. When `list1` is not empty, it replaces the last element. When `list1` is empty, it simply assigns `list2` to `list1`. Since the function behaves as expected in all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
