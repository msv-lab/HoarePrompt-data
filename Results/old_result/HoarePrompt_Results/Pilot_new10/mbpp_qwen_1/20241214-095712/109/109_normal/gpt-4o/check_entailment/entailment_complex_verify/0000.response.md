Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately describes the behavior of the function `func_1`. The function correctly replaces the last element of the first list with all the elements of the second list by returning a new list that contains all elements of `list1` except the last element, followed by all elements of `list2`. This matches the problem description and the provided assertions. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being True is accurate.
