Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly replaces the last element of the first list with all the elements of the second list. However, based on the provided code and the output hints, the function actually removes the last element of `list1` and appends `list2` to the remaining elements of `list1`. This means that the last element of `list1` is not replaced but rather removed, and `list2` is appended after it. Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate as the function does not perform the operation as described in the problem statement.
