Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` appears to meet the requirements of the problem description in all the cases tested. It correctly replaces the last element of the first list with all elements of the second list. The examples given demonstrate this:

1. Replacing the last element `[10]` of the first list with `[2, 4, 6, 8]`.
2. Replacing the last element `[5]` of the first list with `[6, 7, 8]`.
3. Replacing the last element `['green']` of the first list with `['yellow']`.

Since the function handles these cases correctly and there are no obvious edge cases or issues that could cause it to fail based on the provided examples, the function can be considered correct.
