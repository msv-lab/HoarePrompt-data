Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem description, the function should return the maximum value of the n-th column in the matrix. However, the program currently returns the maximum value of the (n-1)-th element of each row, which is not the same as the n-th column.

To correct this, the program should access the n-th element of each row, not the (n-1)-th element. Here is the corrected version of the program:

```python
def func_1(matrix, n):
    return max(row[n] for row in matrix)
    #The program now correctly returns the maximum value among the nth element of each row in the matrix
```

This correction ensures that the function returns the maximum value of the n-th column as required by the problem description.
