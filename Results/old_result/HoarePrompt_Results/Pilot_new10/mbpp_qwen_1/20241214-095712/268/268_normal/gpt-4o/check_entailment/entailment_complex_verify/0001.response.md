Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to return the maximum value of the n'th column in a given matrix. The provided test cases cover different scenarios and the function handles them correctly. Although the annotations mention that the function will attempt to access the `n`th element even if the row length is less than `n`, it is assumed that the input will be valid. Therefore, the program is correct based on the problem description and the provided information.
