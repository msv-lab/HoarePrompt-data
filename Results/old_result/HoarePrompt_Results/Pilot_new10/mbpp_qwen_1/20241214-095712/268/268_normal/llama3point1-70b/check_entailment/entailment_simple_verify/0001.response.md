Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly finds the maximum value in the n'th column of the given matrix. The annotation states that the function returns the maximum value among the `(n-1)`th element of each row in the matrix, which aligns with the problem description. The function uses a generator expression to efficiently iterate over the specified elements and pass them to the `max` function. Given that the input is assumed to be valid, the program correctly implements the required functionality.
