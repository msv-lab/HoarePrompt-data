Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a matrix (a list of lists) and an integer `n`, and returns the maximum value in the `n`-th column of the matrix. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should take a matrix represented as a list of lists and an integer `n` (where `0 <= n <` the number of columns in the matrix), and return the maximum value in the `n`-th column.
   
2. **Implementation**:
   - The function correctly extracts the `n`-th column from the matrix using a list comprehension: `nth_column = [row[n] for row in matrix]`.
   - It then returns the maximum value from this extracted column using the `max()` function.

3. **Assertions**:
   - The provided assertions check different cases:
     - The first assertion checks the second column (`n=2`) of a matrix with values `[5, 6, 7]`, `[1, 3, 5]`, and `[8, 9, 19]`. The maximum value in the second column is `19`, which is correctly returned.
     - The second assertion checks the second column (`n=1`) of a matrix with values `[6, 7, 8]`, `[2, 4, 6]`, and `[9, 10, 20]`. The maximum value in the second column is `10`, which is correctly returned.
     - The third assertion checks the second column (`n=1`) of a matrix with values `[7, 8, 9]`, `[3, 5, 7]`, and `[10, 11, 21]`. The maximum value in the second column is `11`, which is correctly returned.

Since the function and its implementation meet the problem description and the provided assertions pass without failure, the program is correct.
