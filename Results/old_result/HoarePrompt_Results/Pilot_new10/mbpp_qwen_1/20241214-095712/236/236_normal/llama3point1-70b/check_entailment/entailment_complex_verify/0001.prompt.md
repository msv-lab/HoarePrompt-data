You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(nums)` checks if the input list `nums` is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. This approach is correct because:

- If the original list `nums` is already sorted, it will be identical to its sorted version.
- If the original list `nums` is not sorted, it will differ from its sorted version.

Thus, the function works correctly for all potential cases, ensuring that the input list is checked against its sorted counterpart accurately. There are no edge cases or inputs where this function would fail to meet the requirement of checking if a list is sorted.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of comparable elements.
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the list 'nums' is sorted (either True or False)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of comparable elements. The function checks if the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise. The code does not handle any edge cases explicitly, but we should consider them in the functionality description.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Empty List**: An empty list is considered sorted.
2. **Single Element List**: A list with a single element is also considered sorted.
3. **List with Repeated Elements**: The function will still consider a list with repeated elements as sorted if the order is maintained.
4. **Unsorted List**: Any unsorted list will return `False`.

### Summary:
The function `func_1` accepts a list `nums` of comparable elements and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. It handles edge cases such as an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with repeated elements that maintain the sorted order.

**Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `nums` of comparable elements and returns `True` if the list is sorted in ascending order, and `False` otherwise. It considers an empty list, a list with a single element, and lists with repeated elements that maintain the sorted order as sorted.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
