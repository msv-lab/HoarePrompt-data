Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code implements a function `func_1` that checks whether a given list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The function iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds any element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after completing the iteration without finding any out-of-order elements.

Based on the problem description and the provided assertions, the function appears to handle the basic cases correctly:
1. It correctly identifies a sorted list (e.g., `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`).
2. It correctly identifies a list that is not sorted due to a single out-of-order pair (e.g., `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`).
3. It correctly identifies a list that is not sorted due to a pair that breaks the order (e.g., `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]`).

Since the code logic matches the problem description and the provided examples, and no counterexamples were found, the code is correct.
