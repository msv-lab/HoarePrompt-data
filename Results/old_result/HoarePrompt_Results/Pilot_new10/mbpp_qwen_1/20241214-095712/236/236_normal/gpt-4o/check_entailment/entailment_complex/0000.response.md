Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than the next element, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The function meets the problem description for all potential cases:
1. It correctly identifies that `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]` is sorted.
2. It correctly identifies that `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` is not sorted because of the pair `(14, 20)`.
3. It correctly identifies that `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]` is not sorted because of the pair `(15, 14)`.

Thus, the function always does what the problem description asks for.
