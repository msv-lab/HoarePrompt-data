#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of comparable elements.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of comparable elements, and the function returns True if no element is found to be greater than the next element in the list. If any element is found to be greater than the next element, the function returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and returns `False` if any element in the list is greater than the next element. Otherwise, it returns `True`.
