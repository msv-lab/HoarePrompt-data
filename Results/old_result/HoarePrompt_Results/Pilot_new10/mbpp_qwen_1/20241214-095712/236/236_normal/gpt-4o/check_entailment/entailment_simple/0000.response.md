Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` checks whether a given list is sorted in non-decreasing order (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next element). Here's a detailed explanation:

1. **Functionality**: The function iterates through the list using a for loop from the first element to the second last element. It compares each element with the next one. If it finds an element that is greater than its successor, it immediately returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the loop completes without finding any such pair, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

2. **Assertions**:
   - The first assertion checks a list `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 16, 17]`, which is sorted, and the function correctly returns `True`.
   - The second assertion checks a list `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]`, which is not sorted due to the element `20` being greater than `17`, and the function correctly returns `False`.
   - The third assertion checks a list `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]`, which is not sorted due to the element `15` being greater than `14`, and the function correctly returns `False`.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - An empty list or a single-element list is considered sorted, which this implementation handles correctly since there are no elements to compare.
   - Lists with all elements equal are also considered sorted, which this implementation handles correctly as well.

Given that the program correctly identifies whether a list is sorted according to the provided problem description and passes all the given test cases, the correctness of the program is **True**.
