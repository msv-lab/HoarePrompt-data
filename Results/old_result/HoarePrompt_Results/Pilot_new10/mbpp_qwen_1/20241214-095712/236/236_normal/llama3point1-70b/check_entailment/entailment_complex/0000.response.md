Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a given list `nums` is sorted in ascending order. The function returns `True` if the list is sorted and `False` otherwise. The logic implemented in the function, `return nums == sorted(nums)`, correctly checks if the original list `nums` is equal to its sorted version. 

- For an **empty list**, the function returns `True` because an empty list is considered sorted.
- For a **list with a single element**, the function also returns `True` since there's no second element to compare and hence it maintains the sorted order trivially.
- For a **list with repeated elements** that maintain the sorted order, the function returns `True`.
- For an **unsorted list**, the function returns `False`.

The function correctly implements the problem description and handles all the mentioned edge cases appropriately. Therefore, the program is correct.
