Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment correctly points out that the function `func_1` does not check if the list is sorted in the correct manner. Instead of comparing adjacent elements, it compares the original list to its sorted version, which can lead to incorrect results as demonstrated in the example `[1, 3, 2]`. The provided output hints confirm that the function checks if the list is sorted in ascending order, but they do not negate the fact that the comparison method used is incorrect. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
