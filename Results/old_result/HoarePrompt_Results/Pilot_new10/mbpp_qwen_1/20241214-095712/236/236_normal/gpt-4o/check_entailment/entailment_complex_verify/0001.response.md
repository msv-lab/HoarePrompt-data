Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the annotated version of the code and the problem description, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The annotations confirm that the function iterates through the list and returns `False` if it finds any element that is greater than the next element. If no such element is found, it returns `True`. The provided test cases also align with the expected behavior of the function. Therefore, the original assessment that the function is correct is valid.
