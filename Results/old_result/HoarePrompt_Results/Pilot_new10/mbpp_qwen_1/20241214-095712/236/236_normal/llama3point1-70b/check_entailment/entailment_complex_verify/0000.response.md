Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is incorrect because it compares the list to its sorted version, which does not preserve the original order and hence does not correctly identify if the list is sorted. However, upon reviewing the annotated version and the problem description, it becomes clear that the function indeed checks if the list is sorted by comparing it to its sorted version, which is a valid approach to determine if a list is sorted. The function works correctly under the assumption that a list is sorted if it is identical to its sorted version. Therefore, the original assessment was not accurate.
