You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether a specified list is sorted or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    return nums == sorted(nums)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(nums)` checks if the input list `nums` is sorted by comparing it with its sorted version using the `sorted()` function. This approach is correct because:

- If the original list `nums` is already sorted, it will be identical to its sorted version.
- If the original list `nums` is not sorted, it will differ from its sorted version.

Thus, the function works correctly for all potential cases, ensuring that the input list is checked against its sorted counterpart accurately. There are no edge cases or inputs where this function would fail to meet the requirement of checking if a list is sorted.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of comparable elements. The function checks if the list `nums` is sorted in ascending order and returns `True` if it is, and `False` otherwise. The code does not handle any edge cases explicitly, but we should consider them in the functionality description. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
