Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of a character. The assertions given in the test cases (`assert func_1('A') == 65`, `assert func_1('R') == 82`, `assert func_1('S') == 83`) all pass, meaning the function returns the correct ASCII values for these characters. 

Since the function works correctly for the given examples and the `ord()` function is reliable for determining ASCII values, we can conclude that the function will work correctly for any valid input character. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that would cause this function to fail, so we can assert that the function meets the requirements for every potential case.
