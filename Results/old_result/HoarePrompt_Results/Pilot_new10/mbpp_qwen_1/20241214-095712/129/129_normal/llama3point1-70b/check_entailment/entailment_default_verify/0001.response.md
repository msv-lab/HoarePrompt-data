Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the given character, as described in the problem statement. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a single character string and returns its ASCII value, which matches the expected behavior. There are no indications from the problem description or the output hints that suggest the program is incorrect for any potential case. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
