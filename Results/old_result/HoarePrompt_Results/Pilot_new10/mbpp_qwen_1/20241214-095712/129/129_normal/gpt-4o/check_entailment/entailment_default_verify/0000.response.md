Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` uses the `ord()` function to correctly return the ASCII value of the given character. The output hints confirm that the function accepts a single character string and returns its ASCII numeric value. The original test cases cover the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S', and the function passes these tests. There are no apparent logical errors or edge cases that would cause the function to fail under the given problem description and assumptions about valid input.
