Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided code, the function `func_1` correctly uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of the given character. The annotated version confirms that the function takes a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value. The test cases provided in the assertions validate that the function behaves as expected for the characters 'A', 'R', and 'S'. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
