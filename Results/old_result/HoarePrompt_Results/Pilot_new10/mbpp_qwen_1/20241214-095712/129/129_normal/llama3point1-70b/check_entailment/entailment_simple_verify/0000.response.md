Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original program both indicate that the function `func_1` correctly takes a single character string as input and returns its ASCII value using the `ord()` function. The annotation clearly shows that the state of the program before the function call is that `char` is a single character string, which aligns with the function's parameter specification. The original assessment is accurate because the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description without any issues under the assumption that the input is valid.
