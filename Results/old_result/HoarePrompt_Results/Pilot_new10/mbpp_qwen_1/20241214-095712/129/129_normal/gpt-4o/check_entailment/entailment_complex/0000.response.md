Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII numeric value using the built-in `ord()` function. The provided test cases assert that `func_1('A') == 65`, `func_1('R') == 82`, and `func_1('S') == 83`, which are all correct according to the ASCII table. The function meets the problem description exactly because it correctly computes the ASCII value of a given character. Since the function behaves as expected for the given examples and there are no constraints or edge cases mentioned that would make the solution incomplete, the program is correct.
