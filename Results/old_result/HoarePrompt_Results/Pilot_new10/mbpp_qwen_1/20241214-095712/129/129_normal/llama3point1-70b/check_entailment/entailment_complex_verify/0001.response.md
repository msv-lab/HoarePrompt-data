Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the original assessment both confirm that the function `func_1` correctly uses the `ord()` function to return the ASCII value of a given character. The function handles a single character as input, which aligns with the problem description. Since the `ord()` function works for all printable and non-printable ASCII characters, the function will work correctly for any single character input within the ASCII range. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
