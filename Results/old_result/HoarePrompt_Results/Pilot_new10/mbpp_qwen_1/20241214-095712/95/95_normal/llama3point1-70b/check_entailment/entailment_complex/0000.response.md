Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes a string `s` as input and uses the `count` method to find the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' within `s`. The `count` method in Python returns the number of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. Therefore, the function always meets the requirements of the problem description for any input string `s`.
