Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1(s)` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s`. The provided function uses the built-in `count` method, which handles all potential cases, including overlapping occurrences. Therefore, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description, and the original assessment of correctness is true.
