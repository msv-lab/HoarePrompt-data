Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. The original assessment was accurate because the function uses the built-in `count` method, which handles overlapping substrings correctly. All provided test cases are handled correctly, and the function meets the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
