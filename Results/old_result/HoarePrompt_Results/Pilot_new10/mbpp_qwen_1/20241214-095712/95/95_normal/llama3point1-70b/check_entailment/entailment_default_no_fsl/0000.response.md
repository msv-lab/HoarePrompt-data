Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function `func_1(s)` correctly counts the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in the given string `s` using the built-in `count` method. This method handles all potential cases, including overlapping occurrences of 'std'. Since the function behaves as expected for all cases based on the problem description and there are no specific edge cases mentioned in the output hints that the code fails to handle, the program is correct.
