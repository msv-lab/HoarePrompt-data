Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists and returns them as a sorted tuple. The provided output hints also confirm that the function handles the case where either or both lists are empty by returning an empty tuple. Therefore, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
