Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two lists as input, finds the common elements between them, converts these elements into a set to eliminate duplicates, sorts the set, and returns the result as a tuple. 

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Function Input**: The function `func_1` takes two lists (`list1` and `list2`) as inputs, which aligns with the problem description.
2. **Finding Common Elements**: It uses a set intersection operation (`set(list1) & set(list2)`) to find common elements between the two lists. This ensures that any element present in both lists is included.
3. **Removing Duplicates**: Using sets automatically removes any duplicate elements.
4. **Sorting and Returning**: The resulting set is converted to a sorted tuple before being returned. This ensures that the output is always in sorted order, which is a natural requirement when dealing with sets and sorting.
5. **Handling Empty Lists**: Although not explicitly mentioned in the problem description, the program handles the case where either or both lists are empty by returning an empty tuple, which is a logical and expected behavior.

Given the examples provided in the assertions, the function works correctly for all the given cases. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description in all scenarios.
