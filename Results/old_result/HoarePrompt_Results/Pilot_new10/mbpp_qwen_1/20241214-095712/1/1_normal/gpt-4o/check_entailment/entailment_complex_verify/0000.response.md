Final: **True**

Reason: The original assessment is accurate. The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists, converts them into a set, sorts them, and returns them as a tuple. The provided assertions also validate that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases. Therefore, the original assessment of correctness being **True** is accurate.
