Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code accurately reflects the operations performed within the function `func_1`. The function correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists, converts them into a set to remove duplicates, finds the intersection of these sets, sorts the resulting elements, and returns them as a tuple. The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected, returning the correct sorted tuples of shared elements. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
