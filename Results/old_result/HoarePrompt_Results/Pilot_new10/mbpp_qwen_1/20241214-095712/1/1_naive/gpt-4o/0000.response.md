Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists and returns them as a sorted tuple. The function uses sets to find the intersection of the two lists, which ensures that only unique common elements are returned. The use of `sorted` guarantees that the result is always a sorted tuple, meeting the requirement of the problem description. Based on the provided test cases and the general logic of the function, it appears that the function works correctly for the described task.
