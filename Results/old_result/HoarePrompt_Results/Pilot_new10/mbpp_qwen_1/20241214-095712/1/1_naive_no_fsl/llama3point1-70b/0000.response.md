Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples (`test_tup1` and `test_tup2`) and returns a tuple containing the shared elements between them. This is achieved by converting both tuples to sets, finding their intersection using the `&` operator, and then converting the result back to a tuple.

This approach handles all potential cases correctly:
- It works with tuples of any length.
- It handles all types of elements within the tuples (as long as they are hashable, which is required for set operations).
- It correctly identifies and includes only the elements that are present in both tuples.

Since the function meets the requirements for all potential cases, the correctness is **True**.
