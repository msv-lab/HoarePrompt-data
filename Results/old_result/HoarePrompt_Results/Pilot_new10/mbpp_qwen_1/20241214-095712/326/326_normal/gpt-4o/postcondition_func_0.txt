The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `n`, where `n` is the length of `arr` and `n >= 2`. It first checks if `n` is less than 2, returning 0 in that case. Otherwise, it sorts the list `arr`, then iterates through the list to find the smallest difference between any two consecutive elements. Finally, it returns this smallest difference.
