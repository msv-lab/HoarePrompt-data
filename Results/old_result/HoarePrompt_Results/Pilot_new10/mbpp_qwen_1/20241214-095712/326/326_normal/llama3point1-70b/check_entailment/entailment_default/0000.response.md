Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not meet the problem description because it does not take the `target` parameter into account. The function `func_1` is defined to accept two parameters, `arr` and `target`, but the implementation only uses the `arr` parameter and ignores the `target`. According to the problem description, the function should find the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array, regardless of whether these elements are related to the `target` or not. The `target` parameter seems unnecessary for this specific problem.

To correct this, the function should be modified to remove the `target` parameter since it is not used in the provided implementation. Here is the corrected version:

```python
def func_1(arr):
    arr = sorted(arr)
    min_diff = float('inf')
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1):
        diff = abs(arr[i] - arr[i + 1])
        if diff < min_diff:
            min_diff = diff
    return min_diff
```

This corrected version will correctly find the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array.
