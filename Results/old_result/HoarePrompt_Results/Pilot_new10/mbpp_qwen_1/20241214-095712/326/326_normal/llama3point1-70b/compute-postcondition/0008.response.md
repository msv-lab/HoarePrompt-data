The code calculates the absolute difference between the last element (`arr[i]`) and the second last element (`arr[i + 1]`) of the list `arr`. Since `i` is initially set to `len(arr) - 1`, `i + 1` refers to the index of the second last element in the list. The value of `diff` is assigned the absolute difference between these two elements.

Given the initial state where `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements and `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, the value of `diff` will be `abs(arr[len(arr) - 1] - arr[len(arr) - 2])`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `diff` is `abs(arr[len(arr) - 1] - arr[len(arr) - 2])`**
