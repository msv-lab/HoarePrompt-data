Final: **False**

Reason: The original assessment states that the function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two consecutive elements in the sorted array. However, based on the problem description, the function is expected to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array, not just consecutive elements. The provided function only considers adjacent elements, which means it does not meet the requirement of finding the minimum difference between any two elements in the array. For example, in the array `[1, 5, 9, 3]`, the minimum difference between any two elements should be `2` (between `1` and `3`), but the function will return `4` (between `1` and `5`). Therefore, the original assessment is not accurate.
