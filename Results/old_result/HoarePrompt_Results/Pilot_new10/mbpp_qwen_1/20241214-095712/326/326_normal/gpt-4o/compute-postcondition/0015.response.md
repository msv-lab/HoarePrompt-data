`i` is incremented by 1, so `i` becomes 3. The variable `diff` is assigned the value of `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`, which translates to `arr[4] - arr[3]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` remains a sorted list of integers, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, and `diff` is `arr[4] - arr[3]`.

Output State: **`arr` remains a sorted list of integers, `n` must be at least 3, `i` is 3, and `diff` is `arr[4] - arr[3]`**.
