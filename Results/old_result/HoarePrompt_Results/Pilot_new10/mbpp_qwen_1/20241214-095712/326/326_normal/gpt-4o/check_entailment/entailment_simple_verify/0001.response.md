Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code, the original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly finds the minimum difference between any two elements in the given array. The annotated version confirms that the function handles the case where the array has fewer than 2 elements by returning 0, and it correctly sorts the array to find the minimum difference between consecutive elements. The provided test cases also validate the function's correctness for different scenarios. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
