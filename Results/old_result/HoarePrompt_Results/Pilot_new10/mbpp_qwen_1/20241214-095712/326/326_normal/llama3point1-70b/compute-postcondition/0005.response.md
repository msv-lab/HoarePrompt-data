The code updates the value of `min_diff` to be equal to `diff`. Since `diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`, and its current value is less than `min_diff`, `min_diff` is now set to this value. The precondition that `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements remains unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `min_diff` is the absolute difference between `arr[i]` and `arr[i + 1]`.**
