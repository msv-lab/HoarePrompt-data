Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 2`, and `diff` is `abs(arr[len(arr) - 2] - arr[len(arr) - 1])`. If `diff` is less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `min_diff` is set to `abs(arr[len(arr) - 2] - arr[len(arr) - 1])`.***
