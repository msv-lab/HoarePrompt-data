The code initializes `min_diff` to infinity (`float('inf')`). This does not change the values of `arr` or `n`. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of the list such that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is infinity (`float('inf')`)**
