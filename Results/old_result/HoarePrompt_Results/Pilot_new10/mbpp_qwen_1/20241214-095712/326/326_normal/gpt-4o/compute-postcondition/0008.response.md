The code `min_diff = diff` assigns the current value of `diff` to `min_diff`. Given that the current value of `diff` is less than the current value of `min_diff`, which is initially set to infinity, `min_diff` will now hold the value of `diff`.

Other variables are not affected by this assignment.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is the length of the list such that `n` is at least 2, `min_diff` is the current value of `diff`, `i` is 0, `diff` is `arr[1] - arr[0]`**
