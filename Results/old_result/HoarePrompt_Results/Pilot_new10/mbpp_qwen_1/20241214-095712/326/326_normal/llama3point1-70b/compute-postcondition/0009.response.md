The code assigns the value of `diff` to `min_diff`. Since `diff` is already defined as the absolute difference between the last two elements of the list `arr`, the value of `min_diff` is set to this same value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `diff` is `abs(arr[len(arr) - 1] - arr[len(arr) - 2])`, `min_diff` is `diff`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least two elements, `i` is `len(arr) - 1`, `diff` is `abs(arr[len(arr) - 1] - arr[len(arr) - 2])`, `min_diff` is `diff`**
