Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. The function first checks if the number of elements `n` is less than 2, in which case it returns 0. If `n` is 2 or more, the function sorts the array and then iterates through the sorted array to find the minimum difference between consecutive elements. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, and the function passes them, indicating its correctness. Therefore, the original assessment of the program's correctness being True is accurate.
