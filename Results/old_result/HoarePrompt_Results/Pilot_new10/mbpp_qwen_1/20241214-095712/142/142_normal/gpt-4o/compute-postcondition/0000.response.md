According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. For the loop to execute, `lst` must contain at least one element. The variable `item` will take on each value from the list `lst` during each iteration of the loop, but we don't need to specify its initial state since it's not defined before the loop starts.

State: **`lst` must have at least one element**
