Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an element `element`, and checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. It iterates through each item in the list and returns `False` as soon as it finds an item that is not equal to the given element. If it completes the loop without finding any mismatch, it returns `True`. The provided assertions also confirm that the function works as expected for the given test cases. Therefore, the code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case.
