Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code and the explanation provided in the original assessment accurately describe the functionality of the `func_1` function. The function correctly uses the `all()` function along with a generator expression to check if every item in the list `lst` is equal to the given `element`. The annotation correctly reflects the behavior of the function, indicating that it returns `True` if all items in the list are equal to the given element and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate, and the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
