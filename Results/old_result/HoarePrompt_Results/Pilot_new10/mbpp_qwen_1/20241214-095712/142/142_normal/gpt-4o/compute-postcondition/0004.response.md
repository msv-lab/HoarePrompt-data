According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `lst`. For the loop to execute again, `lst` must have at least one element. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` must have at least one element, and `item` is equal to `element`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `lst` must still have at least one element, and `item` will be set to the next element in the list.

State: **`lst` must have at least one element, and `item` is equal to the next element in the list**
