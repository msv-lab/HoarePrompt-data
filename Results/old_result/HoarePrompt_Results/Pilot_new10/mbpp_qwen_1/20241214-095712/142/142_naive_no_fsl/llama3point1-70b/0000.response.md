Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` uses the built-in `all()` function to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element. The expression `(item == element for item in lst)` generates a generator that yields `True` for each item in the list that matches the given element, and `False` otherwise. The `all()` function returns `True` only if all elements in the generator are `True`. This means that if all items in the list are equal to the given element, the function will return `True`; otherwise, it will return `False`. Since the function behaves exactly as described in the problem statement for all potential cases, it is correct.
