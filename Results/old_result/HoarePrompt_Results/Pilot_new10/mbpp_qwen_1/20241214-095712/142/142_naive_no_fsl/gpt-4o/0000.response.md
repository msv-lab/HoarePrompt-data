Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` iterates through each item in the list and checks if it is equal to the given element. If any item is not equal to the element, it returns `False`. Otherwise, it returns `True` after checking all items. This logic correctly implements the requirement to check if all items in the list are equal to the given element.

The provided test cases cover different scenarios:
1. An example where the list contains elements that are not equal to the given element (`['green', 'orange', 'black', 'white'], 'blue'`).
2. An example where the list contains elements that are not equal to the given element (`[1, 2, 3, 4], 7`).
3. An example where all elements in the list are equal to the given element (`['green', 'green', 'green', 'green'], 'green'`).

Since the function works correctly for these cases and the logic appears sound, the program is correct.
