Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. It finds the minimum and maximum values in the array and computes their difference. This approach works for any array of integers, including edge cases such as arrays with duplicate elements, arrays with negative numbers, and arrays with a single element. The test cases provided also confirm its correctness. Therefore, the program is correct for every potential case.
