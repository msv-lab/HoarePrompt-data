Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. This approach works for all possible cases, including arrays with negative numbers, zero, or repeated values. Since the function accurately computes the maximum difference for any valid input array, it meets the requirements of the problem description in all scenarios.
