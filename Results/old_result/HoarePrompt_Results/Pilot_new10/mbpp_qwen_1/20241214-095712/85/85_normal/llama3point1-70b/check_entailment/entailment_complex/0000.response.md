Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. The function takes a list of integers `arr` as input and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum integers in the list. This directly corresponds to finding the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. 

- The function uses the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions to find the maximum and minimum values in the list `arr`, respectively.
- It then calculates the difference between these two values by subtracting the minimum from the maximum.
- This approach ensures that the function works for any list of integers provided as input, as long as the list contains at least two elements.

Since the function always performs the exact operation required by the problem description for all valid inputs, the program is correct.
