Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` correctly computes the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The function first finds the minimum and maximum values in the array and then calculates their difference. This approach is valid for any list of integers, including edge cases such as arrays with duplicate elements, arrays with negative numbers, and arrays with a single element. The provided assertions also confirm the correctness of the function. Therefore, the original assessment was accurate.
