Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by subtracting the minimum element from the maximum element. Given the problem description and the annotations, the original assessment is accurate as the function works for all valid input arrays, including those with negative numbers, zero, or repeated values.
