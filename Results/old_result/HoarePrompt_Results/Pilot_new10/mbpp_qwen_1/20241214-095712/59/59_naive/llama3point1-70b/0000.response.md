Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` merges three lists into a single list and then sorts it using Python's built-in `sorted` function. This approach works correctly for merging and sorting the lists. Given that the `sorted` function in Python handles all edge cases (such as empty lists, lists with duplicate elements, etc.), the function `func_1` will produce the correct result for any input lists. Therefore, there is no potential case where this program does not meet the requirements described in the problem statement.
