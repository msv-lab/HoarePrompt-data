Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code confirms that the function `func_1` correctly merges three input lists into a single sorted list. The function concatenates the three lists using the `+` operator and then sorts the result using the `sorted` function. Given that the input lists are assumed to contain integers and the function handles all possible inputs correctly according to the problem description, the original assessment is accurate.
