The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. Each of these parameters is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it returns a sorted list containing all integers from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` combined.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept three lists of integers (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) and return a sorted list of all integers contained in these lists.
