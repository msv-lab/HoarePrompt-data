Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly merges and sorts three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` concatenates the three input lists (`list1`, `list2`, and `list3`) into one list, then sorts this combined list in ascending order. The examples given in the problem description show that the function produces the expected results for the provided inputs. There is no indication from the problem description or the examples that the code fails to meet the requirements for any potential case. Thus, the code is correct according to the problem description.
