Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. Here's why:

1. The function takes three parameters, `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`, which are lists of integers, as specified in the problem description.
2. It concatenates these three lists into one using the `+` operator, resulting in a new list `combined_list` that contains all the elements from the input lists.
3. It then sorts this combined list in ascending order using the `sorted()` function, resulting in `sorted_list`.
4. Finally, it returns `sorted_list`.

The assertions provided in the comments demonstrate different cases with varying lengths and values in the input lists, and the function passes all these tests, producing the correct sorted output. Since the function meets the requirements of merging three lists into a single sorted list for any combination of input lists, the program is correct.
