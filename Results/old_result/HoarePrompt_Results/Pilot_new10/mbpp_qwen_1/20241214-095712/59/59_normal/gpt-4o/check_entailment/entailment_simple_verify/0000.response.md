Final: **True**

Reason: The annotated version of the code clearly shows that the function `func_1` combines three input lists into one and sorts it. The assertions provided in the annotations validate the function against various test cases, and the function performs as expected, merging and sorting the lists correctly. Therefore, the original assessment of the function's correctness being True is accurate based on the problem description and the provided code.
