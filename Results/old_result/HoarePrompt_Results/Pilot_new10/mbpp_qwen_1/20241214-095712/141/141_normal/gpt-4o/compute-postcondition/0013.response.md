The code `frequency[digit] += 1` increments the count of `digit` in the `frequency` dictionary by 1 if `digit` is already present in `frequency`; otherwise, it adds `digit` to `frequency` with a count of 1. The initial state is that `digit_str` contains at least one character, and if `digit` is already in `frequency`, its count is incremented by one; otherwise, `digit` is added to `frequency` with a count of 1.

After executing the line of code, the count of `digit` in `frequency` is updated accordingly. The output state is:

Output State: **`digit_str` must contain at least one character; if `digit` is already in `frequency`, its count is incremented by one; otherwise, `digit` is added to `frequency` with a count of 1; `frequency[digit]` is updated by incrementing the existing count by 1 or adding `digit` with a count of 1.**
