Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It converts the integer to a string, counts the frequency of each digit, and checks if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to the digit itself. The examples given (`func_1(1234) == True`, `func_1(51241) == False`, `func_1(321) == True`) align with the expected behavior. The code handles all digits and their frequencies correctly according to the problem description, and there are no apparent edge cases that the code is missing based on the provided information.
