Output State: **`digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique digits in `digit_str` and the values are the counts of those digits in `digit_str`.**

### Explanation:
- **`digit_str`**: This variable remains unchanged after the loop completes. It is the string representation of the integer `n` provided in the initial state.
- **`frequency`**: After the loop completes, the `frequency` dictionary contains the count of each unique digit present in `digit_str`. The loop iterates over each character (digit) in `digit_str`. For each digit, if it is already a key in the `frequency` dictionary, its corresponding value (count) is incremented by 1. If it is not already a key, it is added to the dictionary with a count of 1.

Since the loop will always update the `frequency` dictionary based on the digits in `digit_str`, and since `digit_str` represents all the digits of `n`, the final `frequency` dictionary will contain the count of each digit in `n`.

### Edge Case:
- If the loop does not execute (which would only happen if `digit_str` is an empty string), both `digit_str` and `frequency` remain in their initial states:
  - `digit_str` is an empty string.
  - `frequency` is an empty dictionary `{}`.
