Let's analyze the annotated code step by step:

1. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` as input.
2. It converts `n` into its string representation `digit_str`.
3. It initializes an empty dictionary `frequency` to store the count of each digit in `digit_str`.
4. It iterates over each digit in `digit_str` and updates the count in `frequency`.
5. After populating the `frequency` dictionary, it iterates over each key-value pair in `frequency`.
6. For each key-value pair `(digit, count)` in `frequency`, it checks if `count` is greater than the integer value of `digit`.
7. If any such condition is met, it returns `False`.
8. If no condition is met during the iteration, it returns `True`.

The return postconditions indicate that the function always returns `False` in all cases. However, upon closer inspection of the code, we can see that the function should return `True` only if no digit in the frequency dictionary has a count greater than its integer value.

Given this, let's summarize the functionality of the function:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if the count of any digit in the string representation is greater than the digit itself. If such a condition is found, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.**
