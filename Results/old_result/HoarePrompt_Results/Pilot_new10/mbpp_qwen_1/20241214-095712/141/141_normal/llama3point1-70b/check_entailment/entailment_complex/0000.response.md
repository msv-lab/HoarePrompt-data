Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. Hereâ€™s a detailed breakdown:

1. **Problem Description**: The function should take an integer `n` and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
2. **Program Implementation**:
   - The function first converts the integer `n` to a string `str_n`.
   - It then iterates over each digit in `str_n`.
   - For each digit, it checks if the count of that digit in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of that digit.
   - If it finds any digit whose count exceeds its own value, it immediately returns `False`.
   - If the loop completes without finding any such digit, it returns `True`.

The key points are:
- The function correctly converts the integer to a string, allowing it to process each digit individually.
- The condition `if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit)` accurately checks if the frequency of the current digit exceeds its value.
- The loop ensures that all digits are checked, and the function returns `False` as soon as it finds a digit that fails the condition, aligning with the requirement that the frequency should be less than or equal to the digit itself.

Thus, the program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
