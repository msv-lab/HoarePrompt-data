Postcondition: ***`str_n` is a string with at least one character, `digit` is the next character in `str_n`, and the count of the current `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of the next character in `str_n`. If the count of `digit` in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of the next character in `str_n`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function returns nothing (None).***
