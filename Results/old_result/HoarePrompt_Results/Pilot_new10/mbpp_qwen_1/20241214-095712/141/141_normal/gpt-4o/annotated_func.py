#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    digit_str = str(n)
    frequency = {}
    for digit in digit_str:
        if digit in frequency:
            frequency[digit] += 1
        else:
            frequency[digit] = 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is a dictionary where the keys are the unique digits in `digit_str` and the values are the counts of those digits in `digit_str`.
    for (digit, count) in frequency.items():
        if count > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `digit_str` is a non-empty string, `frequency` is a dictionary with the counts of each digit in `digit_str`, the function returns False if any count in `frequency` is greater than the corresponding digit, otherwise, the function returns True.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n`, converts it to a string, and checks if the count of any digit in the string representation is greater than the digit itself. If such a condition is found, the function returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`.
