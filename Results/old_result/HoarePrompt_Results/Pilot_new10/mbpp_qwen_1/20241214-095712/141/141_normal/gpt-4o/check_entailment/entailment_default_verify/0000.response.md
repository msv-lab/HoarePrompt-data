Final: **True**

Reason: The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement.

The function returns `False` if such a condition is found and `True` otherwise. The output hints accurately summarize the functionality of the function. The original assessment is accurate because the function works as expected based on the provided test cases and the problem description.
