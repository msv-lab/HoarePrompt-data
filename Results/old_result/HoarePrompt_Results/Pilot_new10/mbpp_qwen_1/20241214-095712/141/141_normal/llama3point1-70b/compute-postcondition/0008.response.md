Let's break down the problem step by step:

1. **Initial State**: The state at the end of the previous iteration is given as follows:
   - `str_n` is a string with at least one character.
   - The count of the digit in `str_n` is either less than or equal to the integer value of the next character in `str_n`.

2. **Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over each character in `str_n` using `digit` as the current character.

3. **State Adjustment for Next Iteration**:
   - For the loop to execute one more time, `digit` should be the next character in `str_n` (after the character that was just processed).
   - Since `str_n` is a string, the next character in `str_n` would be accessed via indexing. After processing the current character, the next character becomes the new `digit`.

4. **Condition Check**:
   - The condition to check is that the count of the digit in `str_n` should be less than or equal to the integer value of the next character in `str_n`.
   - This condition is checked at the start of each iteration to determine if the loop should continue.

5. **State at the Start of Next Iteration**:
   - The current `digit` will be the next character in `str_n`.
   - The condition needs to be re-evaluated with the updated `digit`.

Given these points, we can formulate the state adjustment for the next iteration:

- The string `str_n` remains the same.
- The variable `digit` will be the next character in `str_n`.
- The condition to check is that the count of the current `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of the next character in `str_n`.

Thus, the state at the start of the next iteration is:

**State: **`str_n` is a string with at least one character, `digit` is the next character in `str_n`, and the count of the current `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of the next character in `str_n`**.
