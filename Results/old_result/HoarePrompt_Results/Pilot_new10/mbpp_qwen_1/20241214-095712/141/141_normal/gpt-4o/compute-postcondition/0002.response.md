According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digit_str`. For the loop to execute, `digit_str` must contain at least one character. The loop iterates over each character in `digit_str`, so if `digit_str` is empty, the loop will not execute.

Here are the states that need to be adjusted:

- `digit_str` must contain at least one character.
- `n` is an integer (this remains unchanged as it doesn't affect the loop execution directly).
- `frequency` is an empty dictionary (this remains unchanged as it doesn't affect the loop execution directly).

So, the required state for the loop to execute is:

State: **`digit_str` must contain at least one character**
