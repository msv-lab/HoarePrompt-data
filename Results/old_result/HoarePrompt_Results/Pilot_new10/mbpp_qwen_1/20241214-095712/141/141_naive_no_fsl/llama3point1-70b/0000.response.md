Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Let's verify this with some test cases:

1. For `n = 321`, the digit frequencies are:
   - '3' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 3 (True)
   - '2' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 2 (True)
   - '1' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 1 (True)
   The function returns `True`.

2. For `n = 124`, the digit frequencies are:
   - '1' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 1 (True)
   - '2' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 2 (True)
   - '4' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 4 (True)
   The function returns `True`.

3. For `n = 330`, the digit frequencies are:
   - '3' appears 2 times, but 2 > 3 (False)
   The function returns `False`.

4. For `n = 9876543210`, the digit frequencies are:
   - '9' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 9 (True)
   - '8' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 8 (True)
   - '7' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 7 (True)
   - '6' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 6 (True)
   - '5' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 5 (True)
   - '4' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 4 (True)
   - '3' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 3 (True)
   - '2' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 2 (True)
   - '1' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 1 (True)
   - '0' appears 1 time, and 1 <= 0 (False)
   The function returns `False`.

Since the function handles all tested cases correctly and the logic appears sound, the program is correct.
