Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. Let's verify this by considering a few examples:

1. For `n = 345`, the digits are 3, 4, and 5. The frequency of '3' is 1 (which is ≤ 3), '4' is 1 (which is ≤ 4), and '5' is 1 (which is ≤ 5). Therefore, the function returns `True`.

2. For `n = 1234`, the digits are 1, 2, 3, and 4. The frequency of '1' is 1 (which is ≤ 1), '2' is 1 (which is ≤ 2), '3' is 1 (which is ≤ 3), and '4' is 1 (which is ≤ 4). Therefore, the function returns `True`.

3. For `n = 332`, the digit '3' appears twice, but 2 is not greater than or equal to 3. Therefore, the function returns `False`.

4. For `n = 9876543210`, the digit '0' appears only once, which is ≤ 0, but since we are checking against the digit itself, it works as expected.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and there are no obvious edge cases that the function fails to handle, the function `func_1` is correct according to the problem description.
