Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program `func_1` correctly implements the operation described in the problem statement. The function takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of the second tuple from the first tuple. This matches the requirement perfectly:

- The function uses `zip(tup1, tup2)` to pair elements at the same index from both tuples.
- It then uses a generator expression `a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2)` to compute the difference between the paired elements.
- Finally, it converts the resulting sequence of differences into a tuple using the `tuple()` constructor.

The provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected for different inputs, ensuring its correctness. Therefore, the program meets the problem description in all scenarios.
