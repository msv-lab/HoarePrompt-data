Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of the same length and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for. The function uses a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor to perform the subtraction operation for each pair of elements from the two tuples. Since the code handles tuples of the same length and performs the required subtraction operation, it meets the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
