Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function described in the problem statement. Given two tuples `tup1` and `tup2` of the same length, the function uses a generator expression within a tuple to subtract the corresponding elements of `tup2` from `tup1`. This approach ensures that for every potential case where both tuples have the same length, the function will produce a new tuple with the subtraction results. There are no edge cases or specific examples provided in the output hints that suggest the function would fail to meet the problem description. Therefore, the function works correctly for every potential case as described.
