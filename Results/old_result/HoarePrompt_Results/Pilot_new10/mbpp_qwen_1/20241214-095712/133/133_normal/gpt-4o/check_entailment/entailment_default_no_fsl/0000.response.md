Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines the function `func_1` which takes two tuples `tup1` and `tup2`, and returns a new tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`. The function uses a generator expression within a tuple comprehension to perform this operation, which is consistent with the problem description. 

The assertions provided cover different scenarios, including tuples of varying values and lengths. Since the code handles these cases correctly and the problem description specifies that the input tuples should have the same length, there are no potential edge cases mentioned that the code is not handling. Therefore, the code meets the requirements for every potential case described.
