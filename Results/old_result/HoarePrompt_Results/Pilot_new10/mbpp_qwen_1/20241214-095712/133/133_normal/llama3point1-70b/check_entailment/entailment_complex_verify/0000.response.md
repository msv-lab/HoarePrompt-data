Final: **True**

Reason: Based on the problem description and the provided annotated code, the function `func_1` correctly implements the operation of subtracting the corresponding elements of the second tuple from the first tuple. The annotated code clearly shows that the function returns a tuple where each element is the result of subtracting the corresponding element of `tup2` from `tup1`, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment is accurate.
