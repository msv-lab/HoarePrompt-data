Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements stated in the problem description. The function is supposed to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but it only keeps uppercase characters. 

For example, if the input string is "aBcDeF", the expected output should be "BCDF" (removing the lowercase 'a', 'e'). However, the program outputs "BDF" since it only checks for uppercase characters and ignores both 'a' and 'D', resulting in missing logic to handle mixed and completely lowercase substrings.

Additionally, if the input is an empty string or a string with only lowercase characters, the expected behavior according to the problem description is to return an empty string. The current implementation would also incorrectly handle such cases.

Therefore, since the function does not correctly remove lowercase substrings from the input string as required, the program is incorrect.
