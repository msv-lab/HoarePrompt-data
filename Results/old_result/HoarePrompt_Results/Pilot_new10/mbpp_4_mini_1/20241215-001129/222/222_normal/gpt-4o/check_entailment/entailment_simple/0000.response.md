Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(s)` that removes all lowercase substrings from a given string `s`. 

Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. The function processes the input string `s` using a list comprehension that iterates over each character in the string.
2. It checks whether each character is uppercase using the method `char.isupper()`.
3. If the character is uppercase, it includes that character in the new string; if it's lowercase, it excludes it.
4. Finally, it joins the filtered characters back together into a new string containing only the uppercase characters.

This approach effectively removes all lowercase characters from the input string, which directly aligns with the goal of the problem description. Thus, the function performs as required and consistently adheres to the defined task across various inputs. 

Given the provided assertions (which test the function against different cases), they confirm that the implementation behaves correctly in these scenarios, supporting the conclusion that the program is correct.
