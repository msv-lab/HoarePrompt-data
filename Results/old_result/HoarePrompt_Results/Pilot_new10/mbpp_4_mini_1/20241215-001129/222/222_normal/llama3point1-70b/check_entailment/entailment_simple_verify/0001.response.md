Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not fulfill the requirements stated in the problem description. The task was to remove lowercase substrings from the given string, but the implementation only retains uppercase characters, completely ignoring lowercase substrings. As such, if the input string contains both uppercase and lowercase letters, the function will not return the expected result, which should include all characters that aren't lowercase letters. For example, given the input "aBcDeF", the expected output is "BCDF". The program fails to handle this correctly as it mistakenly omits uppercase 'D'. Therefore, the original assessment remains valid.
