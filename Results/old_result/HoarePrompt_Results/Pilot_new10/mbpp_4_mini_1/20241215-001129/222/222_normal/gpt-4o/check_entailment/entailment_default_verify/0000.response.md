The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **True**, indicating that it correctly follows the problem description of removing lowercase substrings from a given string.

Upon reviewing the code:

```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
```

This function effectively filters out all lowercase characters from the input string `s`, and only retains the uppercase characters. The assertions provided also validate the functionality of the function correctly handling cases where there are mixed uppercase and lowercase characters.

The output hints state that if `s` does not contain any uppercase characters, the function will return an empty string. This is consistent with the requirement to remove all lowercase substrings, as if there are no uppercase characters, the result should logically be an empty string. 

Since the output hints clearly support the logic of the function and align with the problem description, we can conclude that the original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description.

Thus, keeping all of this in mind, the final assessment of the program's correctness is:

Final: **True**.
