Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description and the annotations. The function `func_1` correctly filters out lowercase characters from the input string, maintaining only uppercase letters, which aligns with the requirement to remove all lowercase substrings. The assertions validate the function's correctness for multiple test cases, and the annotations confirm that the function returns a string containing exclusively the uppercase characters from the original string. Therefore, the assessment of correctness as **True** is justified.
