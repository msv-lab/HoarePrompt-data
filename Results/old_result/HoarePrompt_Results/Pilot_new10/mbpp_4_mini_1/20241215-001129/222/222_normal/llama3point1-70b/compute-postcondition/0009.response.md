Given the initial state where `s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`, and `result` is either an empty string or updated based on `char`, we note the following:

1. `result` is concatenated with `char`, so if `char` is an uppercase letter, `result` will now equal `result + char`.
2. If `char` is not uppercase, `result` remains an empty string.

The impact on the code is as follows:
- If `char` is uppercase, the new value of `result` will be equal to the previous value of `result` plus the value of `char`.
- If `char` is not uppercase, `result` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the final output state will depend on whether `char` is uppercase or not.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `char` is the third character of `s`, `result` is either updated to `result + char` if `char` is uppercase, or remains an empty string if `char` is not uppercase.**
