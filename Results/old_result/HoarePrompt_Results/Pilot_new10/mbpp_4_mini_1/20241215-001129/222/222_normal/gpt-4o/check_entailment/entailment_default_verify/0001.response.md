Final: **False**

The original assessment claimed that the program's function, `func_1`, is correct based on the problem description of removing lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the function does not actually remove "lowercase substrings"; it only retains uppercase characters and discards all lowercases, which is not the same as removing lowercase substrings. 

The output hints further emphasize this by stating that the function returns a new string containing only uppercase characters, indicating that it does not accurately execute the intent of the problem as described. Therefore, while it does filter out lowercase characters, it does not align with the wording of "removing lowercase substrings" from the string in a way that suggests it handles cases, such as multiple contiguous lowercase characters correctly.

Given this misunderstanding between the problem description and the actual functionality of the code, the original assessment is not accurate, leading to the conclusion that the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem statement.
