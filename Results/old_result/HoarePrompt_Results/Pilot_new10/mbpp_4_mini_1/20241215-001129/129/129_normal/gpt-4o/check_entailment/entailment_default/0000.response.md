The provided code for the problem description states to find the ASCII value of a character. The function `func_1(char)` uses the `ord(char)` function to return the ASCII value of the input character.

While the function works correctly for single character inputs, the Output hints clearly state that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a single character string, which could lead to errors or unexpected behavior.

For instance:
- If we pass an empty string `''`, it will cause an error: `ord()` expects a single character, and it raises a `TypeError`.
- If we pass multiple characters like `'AB'`, it will also cause an error.

Given these potential issues, the program does not meet the problem description's requirements for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
