Functionality: ** The function accepts a single character string `char` and returns its ASCII (Unicode code point) value. It does not handle any validation or error cases, so passing a non-single character string, an empty string, or a non-string type will lead to errors. However, if `char` is a valid single character, it accurately returns the corresponding ASCII value. **
