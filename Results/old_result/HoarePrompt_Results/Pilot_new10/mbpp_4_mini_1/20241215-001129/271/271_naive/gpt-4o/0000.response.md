To analyze the provided function `func_1`, let's first clarify the requirements from the problem description: 
- The function takes a tuple of tuples.
- It computes the average of corresponding values from each tuple and returns these averages in a list.

Now let's evaluate the program to ensure it meets these requirements.

The program's logic proceeds as follows:
1. It determines the number of elements (assuming all inner tuples are of equal size) using `len(tuples[0])`.
2. It initializes an empty list called `averages`.
3. It loops through each index position and constructs a list of elements from each tuple that corresponds to that index.
4. It calculates the average of these elements and appends the result to the `averages` list.
5. Finally, it returns the `averages` list.

Now, let's consider edge cases and potential issues in the code:
1. If `tuples` is empty, attempting to access `len(tuples[0])` will raise an `IndexError`.
2. If any inner tuple has a different length than others, accessing indices beyond the length of a shorter tuple will raise an `IndexError`.

Neither of these issues has been handled in the provided program. As a result, we can demonstrate that the program does not operate correctly under all potential cases.

For example:
- If we call `func_1(())`, it leads to an error.
- If we pass `((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))`, it will also lead to an `IndexError` when trying to access elements in a mismatched tuple.

Given this analysis, the program does not fulfill the problem's requirements correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
