To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code.

The problem description states that the function should take a tuple of tuples and return a list containing the averages of the corresponding values from each of the input tuples. The provided function attempts to achieve this using the following line of code:

```python
return [sum(val) / len(tuples) for val in zip(*tuples)]
```

**Key points to consider:**

1. **Input Type**: The input must be a tuple of tuples. If an empty tuple is provided or a tuple that does not contain tuples, the code should handle that.
  
2. **Empty Input**: If an empty tuple of tuples is provided, the function will throw a division by zero error because `len(tuples)` will be `0`. This is an edge case that the code does not handle correctly, which violates the requirements of the problem statement. 

3. **Aggregation Logic**: Assuming that valid tuples are provided, the code correctly computes the average for each position. For instance, for input `((1, 2), (3, 4), (5, 6))`, it will compute the averages as `(3.0, 4.0)`.

4. **Data Types**: The function does not check for the type of values within the inner tuples. If any of the values were non-numeric (e.g., strings), it would also raise an exception.

Since the code fails to handle the edge case of receiving an empty set of tuples and could potentially fail with incorrect data types, the correctness of this program is compromised.

Based on the above analysis, I conclude that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False** 

**Example of Failure**: The program would fail for the input `(()`, which is an empty input. It will lead to a `ZeroDivisionError`.
