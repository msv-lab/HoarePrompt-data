The code calculates the average of the second elements from the tuples stored in `tuples`. Since `elements_at_position` is updated based on these second elements, we assume that it holds values that correspond to the second elements of those inner tuples.

1. `avg` is assigned the value of `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`.
2. Given that `tuples` is a tuple of tuples with at least one inner tuple containing at least 3 elements, `len(tuples)` returns the number of these inner tuples, which is at least 1.
3. The calculation `sum(elements_at_position)` consists of the sum of the second elements collected from the inner tuples.

Thus, the information updated after executing the code involves the new value for `avg`, which is the average calculated from those elements.

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple with at least 3 elements; `num_elements` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `elements_at_position` contains the second elements from the tuples; `avg` is the average of the second elements from `elements_at_position`.**
