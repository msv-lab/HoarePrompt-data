#State of the program right berfore the function call: tuples is a tuple of tuples, and each inner tuple contains numerical values.
def func_1(tuples):
    num_elements = len(tuples[0])
    averages = []
    for i in range(num_elements):
        elements_at_position = [t[i] for t in tuples]
        
        avg = sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)
        
        averages.append(avg)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple with a length equal to `num_elements`; `num_elements` is the number of elements in the first inner tuple of `tuples`; `averages` contains the average of each corresponding position across all inner tuples in `tuples`. If the loop does not execute, `averages` remains an empty list.
    return averages
    #The program returns 'averages' which contains the average of each corresponding position across all inner tuples in 'tuples', and 'tuples' must have at least one inner tuple with a length equal to 'num_elements', which is the number of elements in the first inner tuple. If the loop does not execute, 'averages' remains an empty list.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple of tuples, calculates the average of each corresponding position across all inner tuples, and returns a list of averages. If `tuples` is empty or contains inner tuples of varying lengths, this could lead to an error, but the function will return an empty list if no calculations can be made.
