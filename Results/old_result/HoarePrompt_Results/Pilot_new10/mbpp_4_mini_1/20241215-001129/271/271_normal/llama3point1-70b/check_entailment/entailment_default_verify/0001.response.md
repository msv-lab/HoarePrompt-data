The original assessment accurately identifies the critical issue with the provided function, which is that it does not handle the case of an empty input (a tuple of tuples). The assessment correctly points out that if an empty tuple is supplied as the input, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when attempting to compute the averages. 

Additionally, while the output hints acknowledge that the function is designed to work with a tuple of tuples containing numeric values, they reiterate the critical error scenario. As specified in the output hints, the function fails to account for the edge case where it is given an empty input.

Since both the original assessment and the output hints indicate that the program does not meet the problem's requirements for all potential cases, I confirm that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
