Final: **True**

The original assessment pointed out that the function `func_1` does not handle edge cases such as an empty input or tuples of different lengths. However, in the context of the annotations provided, we are assuming valid inputs as per the requirements of the problem description, which states that the function is to take a tuple of tuples with numerical values. Given this, the function correctly computes the averages for each position across the inner tuples provided valid inputs. Therefore, the original assessment declaring the program as incorrect does not hold, as the program fulfills the specified requirement of returning averages for valid inputs.
