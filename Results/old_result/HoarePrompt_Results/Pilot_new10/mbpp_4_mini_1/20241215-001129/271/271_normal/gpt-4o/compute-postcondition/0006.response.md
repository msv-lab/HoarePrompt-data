According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_elements`. If `num_elements` is greater than `i`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `num_elements` is greater than 0, which means the loop has executed once already. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, making it 1. Additionally, `num_elements` must be greater than 1 to allow another iteration.

State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple with at least 1 element, `num_elements` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `elements_at_position` is the list of the first elements from each inner tuple in `tuples`, `avg` is equal to `sum(elements_at_position) / len(tuples)`, `averages` is updated to include the value of `avg`**
