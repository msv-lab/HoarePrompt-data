The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tuples`, which is a tuple of tuples, with each inner tuple containing numerical values. After executing the function body, the program calculates the average of each corresponding position across all inner tuples in `tuples`. The function requires that `tuples` must have at least one inner tuple, and the length of this inner tuple must be equal to `num_elements`, which refers to the number of elements in the first inner tuple. If the loop does not execute, the variable 'averages' remains an empty list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of tuples containing numerical values and return a list of averages for each corresponding position across all inner tuples if the length conditions are satisfied; otherwise, it returns an empty list if no averages can be calculated.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tuples, which is a tuple of tuples containing numerical values, and returns a list of averages for each corresponding position across the inner tuples, or an empty list if no averages can be calculated.**
