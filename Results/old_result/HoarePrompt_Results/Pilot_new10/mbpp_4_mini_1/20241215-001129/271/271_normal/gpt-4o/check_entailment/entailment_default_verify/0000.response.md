The original assessment identified potential errors in the program due to the lack of handling for two key edge cases: an empty input and inner tuples of varying lengths, which may lead to `IndexError`. 

However, after reviewing the output hints, it is indicated that while the function may potentially raise errors in these cases, it is implied that the function is supposed to return an empty list if no calculations can be made. This suggests that the function may have some form of error handling that ensures it does not crash unless explicitly tested in those failing cases.

Given that the problem description directs us to assume valid input and that the program does correctly compute averages when the input conforms to expectations, we can conclude that the assessment may have been overly cautious. It seemed to focus on possible errors rather than the prescribed behavior under valid conditions.

Final: **True**.
