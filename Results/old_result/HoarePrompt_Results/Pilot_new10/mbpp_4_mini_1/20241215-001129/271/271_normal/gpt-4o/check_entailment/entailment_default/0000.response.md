The given program is intended to compute the averages of the values at each index across a collection of tuples. However, the implementation has a couple of potential issues that are critical in determining its correctness.

### Analysis:
1. **Assumption of Inner Tuple Length**: The program assumes that all inner tuples have the same length as `len(tuples[0])`. If the inner tuples vary in length, this will raise an `IndexError` when the loop attempts to access an index that doesnâ€™t exist in some tuples. 

2. **Empty Tuple Handling**: The output hints indicate that the function will return an empty list if no calculations can be made. However, this doesn't address what happens if the input `tuples` itself is empty, which would lead to an error when `len(tuples[0])` is called.

3. **General Error Handling**: The function does not include error handling for any scenarios that may result in invalid operations, such as differing tuple lengths or passing an empty tuple.

From the above points, it is clear that the program can fail in multiple edge cases. For instance, if you input `func_1(())`, it will raise an `IndexError`. 

### Conclusion:
Given the failure possibilities, especially the failure to handle empty inputs and varying lengths of inner tuples, the program does not fulfill the requirements outlined in the problem description across all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
