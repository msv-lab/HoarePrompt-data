Final: **True** 

The original assessment accurately identified the issues with the function `func_1`, particularly the potential for an `IndexError` if the inner tuples are of unequal lengths. However, based on the annotated version of the code and the assumption that the input will always be valid (tuples of the same length), the function does operate correctly according to the specified problem description. 

The function successfully calculates the average of corresponding elements from the tuples, assuming the input follows the stipulated constraint of being well-formed. Therefore, the conclusion that the original assessment is accurate stands, but it is important to note that the problem setup does not detail scenarios with tuples of unequal lengths, allowing for the conclusion that the program is correct within the given constraints.
