The variable `elements_at_position` is assigned the value of a list comprehension that extracts the `i`-th element from each inner tuple in the `tuples` variable. Given that `i` is 0, the list comprehension will collect the first element of each inner tuple. Since `tuples` must have at least one inner tuple with at least one element, `elements_at_position` will contain at least one value.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, we can express the output state as follows:

Output State: **`tuples` is a tuple of tuples that must have at least 1 inner tuple with at least 1 element, `num_elements` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, and `elements_at_position` is a list of the first elements from each inner tuple in `tuples`.**
