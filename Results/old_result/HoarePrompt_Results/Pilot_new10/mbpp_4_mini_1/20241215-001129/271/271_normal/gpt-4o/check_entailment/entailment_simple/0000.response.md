The provided program attempts to compute the averages of corresponding values from each inner tuple and returns them as a list. Hereâ€™s an analysis of whether it meets the requirements in the problem description:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function `func_1` is designed to take a tuple of tuples and return a list where each element is the average of the corresponding values from each tuple. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Extracting Corresponding Values**: The code correctly iterates over the range of the number of elements in the first inner tuple and uses a list comprehension to gather all values at the current index from each of the inner tuples.

3. **Average Calculation**: The average is calculated by summing the gathered elements and dividing by the number of inner tuples. This logic satisfies the requirement to compute the average for each position across all tuples.

4. **Handling of Data Types**: The returned list contains floating point numbers as averages, which is acceptable since averages may not always be whole numbers.

5. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided at the beginning test the function with different tuples, and they validate whether the implementation correctly computes the averages as intended.

After reviewing the function in detail, it meets all aspects of the problem description and handles various cases as intended.

Given this thorough analysis, it can be concluded:

Correctness: **True**

### Explanation:
The function correctly computes the average for each position across all inner tuples. It handles tuples of different lengths effectively since it assumes that all inner tuples have equal lengths (based on the context of the problem). Thus, it aligns perfectly with the task described.
