Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the input `tuples` is empty or contains inner tuples of varying lengths properly. According to the problem description, if there are no tuples or if the inner tuples have different lengths, an error could occur or the calculations could become invalid. The code could raise an `IndexError` when trying to access an index that doesn't exist if one of the inner tuples has fewer elements than the first tuple. 

For example, consider the case of an empty input:
```python
func_1(())
```
This would result in an error when `num_elements = len(tuples[0])` since there is no element to index into.

Additionally, if we have an example with varying lengths:
```python
func_1(((1, 2), (3, 4, 5)))
```
This would also be problematic, as trying to access elements at a position that doesn't exist in both inner tuples will lead to an `IndexError`.

Thus, since there are cases where the function does not behave as intended, the correctness is marked as **False**.
