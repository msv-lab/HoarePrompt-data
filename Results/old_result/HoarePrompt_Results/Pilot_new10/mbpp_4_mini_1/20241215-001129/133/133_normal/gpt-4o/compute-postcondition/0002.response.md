Functionality: ** The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, of the same length containing numeric elements, and returns a tuple that consists of the element-wise subtraction of corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. If the tuples are of different lengths, the function will encounter a `ValueError` during the execution of the `zip` function but this case is not handled within the function. **
