#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup1 and tup2 are tuples of the same length, containing numeric elements.
def func_1(tup1, tup2):
    return tuple(a - b for a, b in zip(tup1, tup2))
    #The program returns a tuple containing the differences of corresponding elements from 'tup1' and 'tup2', which are tuples of the same length containing numeric elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, which contain numeric elements and are required to be of the same length. It returns a tuple with the differences between the corresponding elements of `tup1` and `tup2`. If the tuples are not of the same length, the behavior is undefined as the function does not handle such cases, which could lead to an unexpected result.
