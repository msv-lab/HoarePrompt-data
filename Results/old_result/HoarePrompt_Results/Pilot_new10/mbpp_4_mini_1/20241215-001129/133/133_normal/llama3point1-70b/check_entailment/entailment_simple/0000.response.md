Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in two tuples, `tup1` and `tup2`, and subtracts the corresponding elements from each tuple using a generator expression within the `tuple` constructor. Here are the key points ensuring its correctness:

1. **Element-wise Subtraction**: The function uses the `zip()` function to pair elements from `tup1` and `tup2` based on their indices, allowing for direct element-wise subtraction.

2. **Same Length Requirement**: The problem description states that `tup1` and `tup2` will be of the same length, which, based on the initial comment, is assumed. The `zip()` function will pair elements correctly as long as this condition is satisfied.

3. **Return Type**: The function returns a tuple that contains the results of the subtraction, consistent with the desired output described in the problem.

4. **Numeric Elements**: The restriction to numeric elements (implied by "numeric elements") supports the use of the subtraction operation without encountering type errors.

As a result, the program reliably behaves according to the specifications of the problem description. There are no edge cases or scenarios indicated in the description that the program fails to handle, confirming its correctness.
