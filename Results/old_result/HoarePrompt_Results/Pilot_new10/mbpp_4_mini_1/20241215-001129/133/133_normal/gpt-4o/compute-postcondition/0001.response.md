The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup1` and `tup2`. Both `tup1` and `tup2` are tuples of the same length, containing numeric elements. The function returns a tuple that contains the element-wise subtraction of corresponding elements in `tup1` and `tup2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two tuples of the same length, consisting of numeric elements, and returns a new tuple representing the result of subtracting each element in `tup2` from the corresponding element in `tup1`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two tuples, tup1 and tup2, and returns a tuple that contains the element-wise subtraction of corresponding elements in tup1 and tup2.**
