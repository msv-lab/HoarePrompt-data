Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the requirement to subtract elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index. The use of `zip` allows for proper pairing of elements, and the annotated version confirms that the function will return a tuple of differences for numeric elements in tuples of the same length. The assumption of valid input aligns with the problem description, supporting the correctness of the program as it performs the expected operations without errors.
