Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not handle the case where the input tuples `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths. According to the problem description, it is expected that the function can manage tuples of the same length, but it does not explicitly state how to handle cases where they are not the same length. The implication from the output hints is that a ValueError would be raised if the tuples are of different lengths, which is not handled in the function. For example, calling `func_1((1, 2), (3, 4, 5))` would cause an error, which indicates that the function does not fulfill the requirements for all potential input cases.

In summary, because the program fails to address a potential edge case (tuples of different lengths), it does not meet the correctness criteria.
