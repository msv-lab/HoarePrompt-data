To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we analyze the function `func_1` which is supposed to subtract the elements of the first tuple by the elements of the second tuple with the same index.

1. **Understanding the Functionality**: 
   - The function uses the `zip` function to pair elements of the two input tuples. 
   - It then subtracts the second element from the first for each pair and returns the result as a new tuple.

2. **Analyzing the Test Cases**:
   - The provided test cases demonstrate the intended functionality:
     - For `assert func_1((10, 4, 5), (2, 5, 18))`, the calculation yields `(10-2, 4-5, 5-18)`, resulting in `(8, -1, -13)`.
     - For `assert func_1((11, 2, 3), (24, 45, 16))`, it results in `(-13, -43, -13)` correctly.
     - For `assert func_1((7, 18, 9), (10, 11, 12))`, we get `(-3, 7, -3)` correctly as well.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - Tuples of different lengths: The function does not have logic to handle cases where `tup1` and `tup2` have different lengths. If `tup1` is longer than `tup2` or vice versa, `zip` will only pair elements up to the length of the shorter tuple. This could lead to unexpected results if not handled.
   - Empty tuples: If both tuples are empty, the function will correctly return an empty tuple. However, if one tuple is empty and the other is not, the function will return an empty tuple despite potentially unexpected user input.

4. **Conclusion**: 
Given that the function does not handle cases where the tuples have different lengths (it simply ignores the excess elements in the longer tuple), it will not behave as the problem description might imply in situations involving mismatched tuple sizes.

As we consider all potential cases, we find inadequate handling of tuples of different lengths is a significant oversight. Thus, the function does not correctly handle those scenarios according to the problem's description.

Correctness: **False**
