Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly satisfy the problem description, which requires checking if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. The issue arises specifically with the handling of boolean values.

In Python, boolean values are considered a subtype of integers (True is effectively treated as 1 and False as 0). Therefore, if a tuple contains mixed integers and booleans, the program may incorrectly classify them as the same type since the type of True and False is `bool`, leading to unexpected returns.

For example, consider the case `func_1((1, True))`. The result would be `True`, even though the elements of the tuple have different logical meanings and should be treated as different data types. This violates the requirement of the problem description that specifies checking for uniformity across data types in the tuple.

Thus, the program fails in cases where booleans are mixed with other data types, demonstrating that it does not fully adhere to the problem requirements.
