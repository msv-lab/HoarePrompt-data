Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple containing elements of any data type, `first_type` is the type of the first element, and `element` is the second element in the tuple. If the type of `element` does not match `first_type`, the program returns False, indicating a boolean value. Otherwise, there is no return value and the function continues executing with the existing conditions.***
