The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type. Let's analyze the function based on the problem description, the output hints, and the examples given.

1. The function first checks if the tuple is empty, returning `True`, which aligns with typical logic in such checks.
2. Then, it captures the type of the first element in the variable `first_type` and compares every subsequent element's type to this reference type.
3. If any element's type differs from the `first_type`, it returns `False`. If all types are the same, it returns `True`.

Now, considering the output hints:
- The hints highlight that even though the function should return `True` for tuples with homogeneous types, it can fail in scenarios where boolean values are present. This is because in Python, `bool` is a subclass of `int`, which leads to potential confusion in type checks since it can render `1` and `True` as the same type in certain contexts.

Let's analyze some potential cases:
- For input `(True, 1)`, the function would return `False` when it should logically return `True`, since both `True` and `1` are viewed as integers.
- For input `(5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)` or `(3, 2, 1, 4, 5)`, the outputs are valid and will return `True` since all elements share the same type, which is integer.
- For input `(1, 2, '4')`, the function correctly identifies differing types and returns `False`.

The output hint suggests that unexpected returns may occur specifically with booleans, creating edge cases where the function does not behave as expected. Therefore, while the function does handle the provided examples correctly, its logic fails with certain combinations, specifically where booleans and integers are present.

Given the analysis, the program will not behave as intended in every case due to the special treatment of the boolean type.

Correctness: **False**.
