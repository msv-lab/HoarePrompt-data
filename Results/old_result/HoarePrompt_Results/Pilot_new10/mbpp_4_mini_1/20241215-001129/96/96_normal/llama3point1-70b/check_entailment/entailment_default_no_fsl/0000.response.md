Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the tuple is empty, as the logic described returns `True` in that case, implying all elements (or the lack thereof) are of the same type. However, typically, one might expect a function of this nature to return `False` or raise an error for an empty tuple since there are no elements to compare.

Moreover, the function also returns `True` for a single-element tuple, which could be considered logically sound since there is only one type present. Nonetheless, the problem description lacks clarity on handling these specific cases. For a comprehensive requirement, returning `True` for an empty tuple could lead to misunderstandings.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the expected correctness for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion of incorrectness.
