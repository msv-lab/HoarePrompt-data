Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in the input tuple have the same data type. It handles edge cases appropriately, such as returning `True` for an empty tuple. The annotations confirm that at each step of the function, the stated conditions and logic correctly lead to the desired outputs. The assertions provided cover relevant test cases, validating that the function behaves as expected for typical inputs, including cases with mixed types. Hence, based on both the problem description and the annotations, the program is indeed correct.
