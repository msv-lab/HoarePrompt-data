Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` checks if all elements in a tuple have the same data type by converting their types into a set and checking the length of that set. While this works for most cases, it does not handle the case where the tuple is empty or contains only one element, since in both these scenarios, it will return `True`. According to the problem description, we need to evaluate whether all elements are of the same data type, and the absence of elements (in an empty tuple) or having a single element should not inherently lead to a conclusion of them being of the same data type. Hence, the function fails to meet the requirements for all possible cases. Therefore, it is not correct.
