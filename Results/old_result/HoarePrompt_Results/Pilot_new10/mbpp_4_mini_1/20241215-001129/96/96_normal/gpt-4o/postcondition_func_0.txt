The function accepts a tuple `tup` and checks whether the tuple is empty. If it is empty, it returns True. If not, it verifies if all elements in the tuple are of the same data type. If all elements are of the same data type, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. However, the function fails to account for the specific case where the first element is a boolean, which is treated as a distinct type, potentially causing unexpected returns. Therefore, it can also return False if any element is of an unexpected type while checking for type consistency.
