You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if all the elements in tuple have same data type or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1((5, 6, 7, 3, 5, 6)) == True
assert func_1((1, 2, '4')) == False
assert func_1((3, 2, 1, 4, 5)) == True

def func_1(tup):
    if not tup:
        return True
    first_type = type(tup[0])
    for element in tup:
        if type(element) != first_type:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` checks whether all elements in a tuple are of the same data type. Let's analyze the key points:

1. **Empty Tuple**: The function returns `True` for an empty tuple. This is a sensible choice since an empty collection can be considered homogeneous.

2. **First Element Type**: The type of the first element is stored, and the function compares the types of all subsequent elements to this type.

3. **Type Comparison**: The loop checks each element's type against the first element's type and returns `False` if a mismatch is found.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions cover different scenarios:
   - All integers: Returns `True`.
   - Mixed types (integers and string): Returns `False`.
   - Another case with all integers: Again returns `True`.

Since the program captures the requirements of the problem description and there are no edge cases overlooked, I conclude that it can handle all potential cases correctly. Thus, there are no identified issues in its logic, which satisfies the correctness criterion.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a tuple `tup` and checks whether the tuple is empty. If it is empty, it returns True. If not, it verifies if all elements in the tuple are of the same data type. If all elements are of the same data type, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. However, the function fails to account for the specific case where the first element is a boolean, which is treated as a distinct type, potentially causing unexpected returns. Therefore, it can also return False if any element is of an unexpected type while checking for type consistency. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
