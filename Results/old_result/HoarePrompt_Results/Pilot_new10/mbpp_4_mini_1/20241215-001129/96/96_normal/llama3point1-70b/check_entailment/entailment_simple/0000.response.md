Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly fulfills the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` as input and checks whether all elements within that tuple are of the same data type. It achieves this by:

1. Using a generator expression `type(x) for x in tup` to create an iterable that contains the types of each element in the tuple.
2. Converting this iterable to a set, which automatically removes any duplicate types.
3. Checking if the length of this set is equal to 1 (`len(set(...)) == 1`). If the length is 1, it indicates that there is only one unique type present in the tuple, meaning all elements share the same data type. The function returns `True` in this case; otherwise, it returns `False`.

This logic directly aligns with the problem's requirement to determine whether all elements in the tuple have the same data type, taking into account all potential cases that the input tuple may present (including tuples with mixed types, tuples with one element, and empty tuples). Hence, the program is correct and meets the specified requirements.
