Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description because it correctly checks whether all elements in the given tuple have the same data type. Here's why the program is deemed correct:

1. **Functionality**: The function `func_1(tup)` converts the types of the elements in the tuple `tup` to a set, which automatically removes duplicates. If all elements have the same data type, the resulting set will contain exactly one unique type, thus its length will be 1. The condition `len(set(type(x) for x in tup)) == 1` correctly returns `True` for tuples with the same data type across all elements, and `False` otherwise.

2. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The function correctly returns `True` for:
   - An empty tuple: Because there are no elements, it would imply all (zero) elements are of the same type.
   - A single-element tuple: Since there is only one type present, it trivially satisfies the condition.

Thus, the program adheres to the problem description and performs as specified for all potential cases.
