Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks if all the elements in a tuple have the same data type. It achieves this by converting the types of each element in the tuple into a set and then checking if the length of this set is equal to 1. This method effectively identifies whether all elements are of the same type, as a set will contain only unique items. 

Yes, here are the reasons the code should work correctly for all potential cases:
- If the tuple is empty, `len(set())` will be 0, which is not equal to 1, and the function will correctly return `False`.
- If the tuple contains elements of the same type (e.g., (1, 2, 3)), the set will have a single unique type, and the function will return `True`.
- If the tuple contains mixed types (e.g., (1, 'two', 3.0)), the set will have different types, resulting in a return value of `False`.

Overall, the program handles all specified cases and edge cases correctly.
