Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all elements in the input tuple have the same data type. It does this by checking for empty tuples, storing the type of the first element, and then iterating through the tuple to compare the types of all subsequent elements. 

The provided assertions for testing cover cases where:
- All elements are integers (returns `True`).
- A mix of integers and a string (returns `False`).
- Another case with all integers (returns `True`).

Furthermore, there are no edge cases overlooked, as it handles the empty tuple by returning `True`, which is appropriate because there are no elements to compare. Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
