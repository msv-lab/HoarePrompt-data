Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly merges three lists into a single sorted list. It combines the input lists using the `+` operator, which concatenates the lists, and then sorts the resulting list using the built-in `sorted()` function. This approach will work for any combination of the three lists, including cases where the lists contain duplicate elements or are already sorted. As a result, there are no identified edge cases or input scenarios where the program would fail to meet the problem description.
