To evaluate the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the function and the test cases. The problem description requires a function that merges three separate lists into a single sorted list.

The program given is:

```python
def func_1(list1, list2, list3):
    combined_list = list1 + list2 + list3
    sorted_list = sorted(combined_list)
    return sorted_list
```

### Analysis

1. **Merging Lists**: The first part of the function merges the three lists using the `+` operator, which is correct. It combines `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` into `combined_list`.

2. **Sorting**: The second part uses the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the combined list. This is standard practice and ensures that the output is indeed a sorted list.

### Provided Test Cases

The provided assertions check whether the function behaves as expected for specific input cases. All assert statements indicate that the expected output is indeed the sorted merged list of the three inputs.

### Potential Edge Cases

However, we must evaluate potential edge cases:

- Merging empty lists: If all lists are empty, the function should return an empty list.
- Merging lists with negative numbers: If there are negative numbers included, the function should still sort them correctly.
- Merging lists with duplicates: The function should maintain all duplicates in the final sorted list.
- Varying lengths of lists: Test cases should handle combinations of lists of different lengths.

### Conclusion

Since the program correctly implements the merging and sorting of any three input lists, including those with duplicates, negative numbers, or even if all are empty, it effectively meets the problem requirements.

After evaluating various scenarios and not being able to find any cases where the logic would fail, we can conclude that the code works in all situations outlined in the problem description. 

Correctness: **True**.
