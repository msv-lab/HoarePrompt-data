Final: **False**

The original assessment of correctness as **True** is not accurate based on the provided information. While the function `func_1` does indeed merge and sort the three input lists, the output hints indicate that there are no checks for the types of the input parameters. This means that if any of the inputs are not lists or contain non-integer types, a TypeError may occur. 

The problem description does not mention any constraints on the input content: it specifies that the function should merge three lists into a single sorted list. However, the potential for TypeError due to improper input means that the function does not handle all cases correctly as specified in the problem descriptionâ€”specifically the need to gracefully handle non-list inputs or lists containing non-integer types.

Thus, the original assessment fails to account for this type-related vulnerability, leading to the conclusion that the program does not adhere strictly to the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is **False**.
