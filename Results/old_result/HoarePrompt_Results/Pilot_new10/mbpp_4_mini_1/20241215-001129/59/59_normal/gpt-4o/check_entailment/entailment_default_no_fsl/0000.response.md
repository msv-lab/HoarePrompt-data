Correctness: **True**

The program correctly merges three lists of integers, combines them into a single list, and returns a new list that contains all the elements sorted in ascending order. The implementation of `func_1` follows the problem description accurately by using the `+` operator to concatenate the lists and then using the built-in `sorted()` function to sort the combined list. The provided assertions demonstrate that the function works as intended for a variety of input cases, including lists with overlapping elements and lists of differing lengths.

Since all provided test cases yield the correct sorted list output, and there are no noted edge cases or potential failures in the logic of the merging and sorting process, the program can be deemed correct for the specified requirements.
