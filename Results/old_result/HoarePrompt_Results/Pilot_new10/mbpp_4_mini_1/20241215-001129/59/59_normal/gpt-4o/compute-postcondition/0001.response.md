The `sorted_list` is assigned the value of the sorted version of `combined_list`, which is created by combining all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3`. The order of the elements in `sorted_list` will be the ascending order derived from the integers in `combined_list`. The states of the other variables (`list1`, `list2`, `list3`, and `combined_list`) are not affected.

Output State: **`list1`, `list2`, and `list3` are lists of integers; `combined_list` is a list containing all elements from `list1`, `list2`, and `list3` combined; `sorted_list` is a sorted version of `combined_list`.**
