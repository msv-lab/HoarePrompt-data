The program provided is designed to merge three lists into a single sorted list. The function `func_1` takes three parameters, concatenates them into one list, and then sorts that list before returning it.

Output hints indicate that the function does not perform any checks for the input types. If the inputs are not lists or contain non-integer types, it may lead to a TypeError. This directly impacts the correctness of the program as described, because the problem description implies that the function should handle any possible cases, including cases where the input types are invalid.

From the problem description, we expect the function to handle three lists of integers. However, there are no checks to ensure that the inputs are indeed lists and contain only integers. For example, if any of the lists contains a string or if one of the inputs is not a list (like `None` or an integer), the program could raise an error when attempting to sort the concatenated list. 

Since the program does not account for these potential edge cases and can result in runtime errors depending on the input, it does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
