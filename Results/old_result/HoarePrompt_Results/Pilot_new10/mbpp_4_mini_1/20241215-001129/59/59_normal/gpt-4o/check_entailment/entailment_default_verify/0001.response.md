Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` effectively merges three lists into a single sorted list as described in the problem statement. It correctly combines the lists and utilizes Python's built-in `sorted()` function to return a new list sorted in ascending order.

The test cases provided cover various scenarios, including lists with duplicates and different range values, which are sufficient to demonstrate that the implementation works correctly. Furthermore, the output hints describe the function's functionality accurately, confirming that it handles the expected inputs (valid lists of integers) while sorting the combined elements appropriately.

Therefore, based on both the problem description and the supporting evidence, the program meets the correctness criteria as outlined in the original assessment.
