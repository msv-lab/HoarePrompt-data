Based on the provided information, the original assessment of the program's correctness is **True**. 

The function `func_1` is correctly designed to merge three lists into a single sorted list by utilizing Python's built-in `sorted()` function. The annotated version confirms that at the point of execution, the inputs are properly defined as lists of integers, which aligns with the program's expected behavior.

The reasoning behind the original assessment remains valid because:

1. The program concatenates the three input lists, ensuring all elements from each list are included in the result.
2. The use of `sorted()` guarantees that the returned list is ordered correctly.
3. The function adequately handles cases of varying input combinations, including empty lists and overlapping values, as the sorting mechanism works irrespective of the content provided.

As such, the original logic holds true, and the conclusions drawn from the annotations corroborate this. Therefore, I maintain that the function fulfills the requirements set forth in the problem description without any identified faults.

Final: **True**
