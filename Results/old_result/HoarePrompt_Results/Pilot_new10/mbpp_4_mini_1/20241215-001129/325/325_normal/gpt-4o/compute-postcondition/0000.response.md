The code initializes a variable `months_with_30_days` as a set containing the months that have 30 days: April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). This does not change any existing variables or their values.

Output State: **month is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive; months_with_30_days = {4, 6, 9, 11}**
