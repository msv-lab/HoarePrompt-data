Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description requirements in all cases. According to the problem description, the function must check whether the given month number (1 to 12) corresponds to a month that contains 30 days. The months with 30 days are April (4), June (6), September (9), and November (11). 

The code correctly identifies these months. However, the problem description states that the function should verify whether a given month number has 30 days or not, which suggests that it should also handle and return appropriate responses for other month values, including:

- Months that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December)
- February (month 2), which has 28 or 29 days depending on the year.

However, the program does not specify or provide any assertions or comments on these months, nor does it correctly represent checking for all potential cases based on the problem description.

For example:
- For month 1 (January), it should return `False` (but there is no assertion for it).
- For month 2 (February), it should also return `False`, and while there is an assertion for this, it lacks context.
- For month 3 (March), it should return `False`, but there is no assertion for this month as well.

Due to this incomplete analysis of all months, the program does not fully meet the problem requirements and is hence considered incorrect.
