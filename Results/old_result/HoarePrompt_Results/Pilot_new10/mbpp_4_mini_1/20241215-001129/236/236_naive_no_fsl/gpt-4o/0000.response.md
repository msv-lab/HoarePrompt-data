Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` effectively checks if a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If any element is greater than the following one, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted. If it completes the loop without finding any such pair, it returns `True`, confirming that the list is sorted.

The provided assertions correctly evaluate the function's output for different lists:
- The first list is sorted and returns `True`.
- The second list has elements out of order and returns `False`.
- The third list also has elements out of order and returns `False`.

Furthermore, various edge cases such as empty lists `[]` or lists with a single element `[1]` would still return `True`, as an empty list or a single-element list is inherently sorted.

Given that I cannot find any potential case where the program does not function as described, the function is correct for the problem description.
