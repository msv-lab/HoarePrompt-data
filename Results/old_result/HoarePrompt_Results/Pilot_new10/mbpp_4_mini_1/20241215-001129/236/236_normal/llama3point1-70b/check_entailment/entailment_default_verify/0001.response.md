Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the provided function `func_1(nums)` correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description to check if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The functionâ€™s logic is sound, and it functions properly for various test cases, including edge cases like empty lists and lists with a single element. 

The output hints further confirm the program's functionality, stating that it accurately compares the list against its sorted version and correctly identifies any discrepancies. The assessment acknowledges that there are no additional edge cases or missing functionalities observed in the code, aligning perfectly with the problem requirements.

Therefore, I affirm that the program is correct as it meets all functional expectations laid out in the problem description.
