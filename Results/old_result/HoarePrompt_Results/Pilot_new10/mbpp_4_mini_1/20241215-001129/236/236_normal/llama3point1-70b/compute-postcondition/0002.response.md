Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of comparable elements `nums` and returns `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns `False`. It correctly compares the list against its sorted version, ensuring that any ordering discrepancies will yield a False result. There are no additional edge cases or missing functionalities observed in the code. **
