Based on the problem description and the provided code, I assess the situation as follows:

The function `func_1` is designed to check if a list is sorted in non-decreasing order. It correctly implements this logic by iterating over the list and comparing each element with the next one. If it finds any pair where the first element is greater than the second element, it returns `False`. If it completes the loop without finding such a pair, it returns `True`, thereby indicating that the list is sorted.

The annotations provided accurately describe the different states of the program during execution. The function's behavior with respect to handling lists with fewer than 2 elements (which should return `True`) is noted. It also matches the checks done in the assertions.

The provided assertions further validate the correctness of the function:
- The first assertion validates that a sorted list returns `True`.
- The second and third assertions correctly validate that unsorted lists return `False`.

According to the reasoning in the original assessment, it concludes the function's correctness for the problem description. Given the annotations also support the initial assessment and describe the functionality accurately, I have no reason to deviate from the original assessment.

Final: **True**
