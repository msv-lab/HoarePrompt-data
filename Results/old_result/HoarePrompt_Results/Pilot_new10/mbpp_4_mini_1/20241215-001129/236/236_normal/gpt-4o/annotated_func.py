#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements that can be compared, such as integers or strings.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of elements that can be compared, and it is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute; if the list has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and remains with no return value.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list `lst`, which is sorted in non-decreasing order and contains at least 2 elements, has passed the conditions for execution.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and returns True if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order. If the list contains fewer than 2 elements, it automatically returns True since there are not enough elements to determine an order. If any pair of adjacent elements in the list violates the sorted condition (i.e., if `lst[i] > lst[i + 1]` for any `i`), the function returns False.
