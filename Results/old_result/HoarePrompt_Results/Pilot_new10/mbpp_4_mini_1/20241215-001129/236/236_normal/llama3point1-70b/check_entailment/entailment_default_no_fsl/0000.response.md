Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether the input list `nums` is sorted in non-decreasing order by comparing the list to its sorted version using the built-in `sorted()` function. The check is performed as follows:

1. If `nums` is already sorted, `nums` will be equal to `sorted(nums)`, and the function will return `True`.
2. If `nums` is not sorted, the two lists will not be equal, and the function will return `False`.

The output hints accurately reflect the functionality of the code, stating that it correctly identifies sorted lists and accounts for ordering discrepancies. Since all potential cases have been considered (including empty lists and lists with one element, both of which are trivially sorted), the logic is sound, and no edge cases are overlooked. Therefore, the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
