Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly sums the digits of a non-negative integer. It accomplishes this by converting the integer to a string, iterating over each character in the string (which represents a digit), converting each character back to an integer, and then summing these integer values. 

Hereâ€™s a brief analysis of potential edge cases:

1. **Input Zero**: For the input `0`, the function returns `0`, which is correct since the sum of the digits of `0` is indeed `0`.
2. **Positive Integers**: For inputs like `123`, the function returns `6`, which correctly represents the sum of `1 + 2 + 3`.
3. **Larger Numbers**: For `9999`, it returns `36`, which is also correct since `9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36`.
4. **Leading Zeros**: Since the input is an integer, there are no leading zeros to worry about in the input.

All tested cases align with the problem requirements, meaning the program behaves correctly for all valid non-negative integer inputs described in the problem statement. As no case breaks the expected behavior, I conclude that the program is correct.
