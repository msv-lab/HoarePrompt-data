To systematically analyze the output state after the loop executes, let’s break down the requirements based on the provided structure of the code:

1. **Initial State**: The loop begins with `n` as a non-negative integer (which can be 0) and `total` as 0. 

2. **Loop Behavior**: 
   - The loop iterates as long as `n` is greater than 0.
   - In each iteration:
     - `total` accumulates the last digit of `n` (which is `n % 10`).
     - `n` is then reduced by removing the last digit (`n //= 10`).

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - Each time the loop runs, it adds to `total` the last digit of `n` and shortens `n` by one digit.

### Constructing the Output State:
- If `n` starts at 0, the loop will not execute. Thus, `total` remains 0.
- If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute a number of times equal to the number of digits in `n`.

Given this, let’s summarize the output states after each iteration:

**Output State after the loop executes 1 time**: 
- For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 0. 
- `total` will be `n % 10` (the last digit of `n`), and the new value of `n` will be `n // 10`. 

**Output State after the loop executes 2 times**: 
- After two iterations, `n` must be at least 10 (since 10 and above has at least 2 digits).
- `total` will be the sum of the last two digits of the original `n`, and `n` will have been reduced to `n // 10` from the first iteration and further divided by 10 again in the second iteration.

**Output State after the loop executes 3 times**:
- For the loop to run 3 times, `n` must have been at least 100 (three digits).
- `total` will be equal to the sum of the last three digits of the original value of `n`. The new value of `n` will be reduced to `n // 10` again from the second iteration.

### Final Output State:
- Once the loop completes all iterations and `n` becomes 0, `total` will be equal to the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`. 

Thus, the final output state regarding the loop execution is:

Output State: **`n` is 0, `total` is the sum of all digits of the original value of `n`. If the original `n` was non-negative (including 0), the loop will execute only if `n` was greater than 0 to contribute to `total`. If `n` was initially 0, `total` remains 0.**
