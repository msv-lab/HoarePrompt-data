#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the non-negative integer n
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of its digits. It accurately computes this sum for any non-negative integer input.
