Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to calculate the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer. It iteratively extracts the last digit of the number using the modulus operator and adds it to a total sum, then reduces the number by removing the last digit using integer division. 

The function handles all potential cases as follows:
- If the input is `0`, the while loop does not execute, and it correctly returns `0`.
- For positive integers, it accurately calculates the sum of the digits as demonstrated by the assertions provided in the code.

The output hints match the functionality of the code and confirm that there are no missing cases or errors in the handling of the function's requirements. Thus, the function is correct and operates as expected for all valid input cases.
