The value of `n` is updated with the integer division of its previous value by 10. Since `n` must be greater than 0, the new value of `n` will be a non-negative integer. The value of `total` is not changed by the code provided. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `n` is now the integer division result, while `total` remains the same.

Output State: **`n` is the integer division of its previous value by 10, `total` is increased by the last digit of the previous value of `n`**.
