The operation `n //= 10` performs integer division of `n` by 10, which effectively removes the last digit of `n`. Given that `n` must be greater than 0, this operation will result in `n` being a positive integer greater than or equal to 0, but less than its previous value.

The previous value of `total` is equal to `n % 10`, which represents the last digit of `n`. After executing the code, `n` will change to `n // 10`, while `total` remains the same because it is not affected by the integer division of `n`.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated value of `n` and retain the previous condition of `total`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 0, `total` is equal to the last digit of the previous value of `n`, which is `n % 10`, and the new value of `n` is `n // 10`.**
