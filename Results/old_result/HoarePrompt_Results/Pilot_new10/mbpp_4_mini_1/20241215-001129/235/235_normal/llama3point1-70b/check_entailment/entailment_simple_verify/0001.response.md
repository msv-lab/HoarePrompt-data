Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly sums the digits of a non-negative integer by converting the integer to a string and then iterating over each character, converting it back to an integer, and summing those integers. The annotations confirm that the state of the program before the function call guarantees that `n` is a non-negative integer, aligning with the problem description. 

All edge cases mentioned in the original assessment, including handling of `0` and larger positive integers, indicate that the function behaves correctly. The annotations do not indicate any faults or overlooked aspects of the implementation. Thus, the program is confirmed to be correct in accordance with the problem requirements.
