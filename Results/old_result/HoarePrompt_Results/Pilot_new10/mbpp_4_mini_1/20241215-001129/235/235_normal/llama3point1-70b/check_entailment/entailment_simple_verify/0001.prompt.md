You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    return sum((int(digit) for digit in str(n)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly sums the digits of a non-negative integer. It accomplishes this by converting the integer to a string, iterating over each character in the string (which represents a digit), converting each character back to an integer, and then summing these integer values. 

Hereâ€™s a brief analysis of potential edge cases:

1. **Input Zero**: For the input `0`, the function returns `0`, which is correct since the sum of the digits of `0` is indeed `0`.
2. **Positive Integers**: For inputs like `123`, the function returns `6`, which correctly represents the sum of `1 + 2 + 3`.
3. **Larger Numbers**: For `9999`, it returns `36`, which is also correct since `9 + 9 + 9 + 9 = 36`.
4. **Leading Zeros**: Since the input is an integer, there are no leading zeros to worry about in the input.

All tested cases align with the problem requirements, meaning the program behaves correctly for all valid non-negative integer inputs described in the problem statement. As no case breaks the expected behavior, I conclude that the program is correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    return sum(int(digit) for digit in str(n))
    #The program returns the sum of the digits of the non-negative integer n


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
