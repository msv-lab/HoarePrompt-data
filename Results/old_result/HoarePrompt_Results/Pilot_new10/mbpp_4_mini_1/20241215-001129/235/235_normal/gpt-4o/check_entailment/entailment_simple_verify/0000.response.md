Final: **True**

The program correctly calculates the sum of the digits of a non-negative integer as required by the problem description. The function `func_1` accurately processes the number `n`, extracting each digit using `n % 10` and accumulating these in the `total`. The annotated code confirms that after the loop, `n` becomes 0 and `total` contains the sum of all digits from the original `n`, consistent with the expectation that the input will always be a valid non-negative integer.

The assertions provided further validate the correctness of the function for specific test cases, ensuring that it handles various inputs as intended. Since the annotations provide clarity regarding the state of variables and confirm that logic executes correctly under the assumption of valid inputs, the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
