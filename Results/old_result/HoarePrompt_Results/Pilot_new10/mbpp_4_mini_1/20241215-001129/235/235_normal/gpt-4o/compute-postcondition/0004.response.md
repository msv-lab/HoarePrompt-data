According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `n` must be greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be strictly greater than 0, meaning it must be adjusted to `n` must be greater than 0.

State: **`n` must be greater than 0, `total` is equal to the last digit of the previous value of `n`, which is `n % 10`, and the new value of `n` is `n // 10`.**
