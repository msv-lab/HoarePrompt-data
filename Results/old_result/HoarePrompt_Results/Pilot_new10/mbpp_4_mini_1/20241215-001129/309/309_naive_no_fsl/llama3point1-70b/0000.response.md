Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1(s)` checks whether all the characters in the input string `s` are the same. It does this by converting the string into a set, which removes duplicate characters. If the length of this set is 1, it means that all characters in the string were the same; otherwise, they were not.

Here's the reasoning for its correctness:

1. **Same Characters**: If `s` consists solely of the same character repeated (e.g., `"aaaa"`), the set will contain only one element, yielding a length of 1. The function will return `True`, which is correct.

2. **Different Characters**: If `s` contains different characters (e.g., `"abc"` or `"aab"`), the set will have a length greater than 1. The function will return `False`, which is also correct.

3. **Empty String**: For an empty string `""`, the set created from it will also be empty, resulting in a length of 0. The function will return `False`, which appropriately indicates that not all characters are the same because there are no characters.

4. **Single Character**: If `s` is a single character (e.g., `"a"`), the set will contain one element, resulting in a length of 1. The function will return `True`, which is correct as a single character is trivially the same as itself.

Given the analysis, the function correctly handles all potential cases, and I could not find any example where it fails. Thus, the function is correct.
