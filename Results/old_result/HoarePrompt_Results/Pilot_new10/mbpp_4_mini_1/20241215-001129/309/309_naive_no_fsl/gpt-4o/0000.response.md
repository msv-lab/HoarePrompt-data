Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` is intended to check whether all characters in a string are the same. However, it does not account for an important edge case: when the input string is empty. According to the problem description, there is no explicit mention about the expected output for an empty string, and the function returns `True` for an empty string. 

To illustrate this, let's consider the empty string `''`. The function will return `True` for this case, implying that all characters in the string are the same, which is a misleading conclusion since there are no characters present to compare. Conversely, a reasonable expectation could be that an empty string should return `False`, indicating that there are no characters to satisfy the condition.

Thus, because the function provides an incorrect result for the empty string input, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
