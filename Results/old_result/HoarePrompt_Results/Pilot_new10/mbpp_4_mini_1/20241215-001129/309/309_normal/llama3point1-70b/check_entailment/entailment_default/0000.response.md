Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set and checking if the length of the set is 1. If the string is empty, `set(s)` will also be empty, resulting in a length of 0. Therefore, it correctly evaluates that all characters are the same (since there are no characters). In cases where `s` contains one or more identical characters, the length of the set will be 1, confirming they are the same. If there are different characters, the length of the set will be greater than 1, and the function will return False as expected. The output hints support the function's logic and align with this understanding. Thus, the function behaves correctly for all potential cases described in the problem.
