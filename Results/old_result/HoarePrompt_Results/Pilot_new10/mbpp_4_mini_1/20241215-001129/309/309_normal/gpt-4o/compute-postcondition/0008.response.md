According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, it must have more characters for the loop to execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is equal to `first_char`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that `char` changes with each iteration, iterating through the characters of `s`.

When the loop executes again, `char` will be the next character in `s`. If the current `char` is the first character, then after one iteration, it will move to the second character in `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least 2 characters, and `char` will be the second character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string that must have at least 2 characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character of `s`**.
