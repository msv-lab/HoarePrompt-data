The output hints state that the function "returns `True` if they are identical and `False` otherwise", and it also claims that in the case of an empty string, the function will return `True`. However, this contradicts the original assessment and the logic of the provided code. 

The function `func_1(s)` correctly identifies that an empty string returns `False`, as the set created from an empty string will have a length of 0. Therefore, the output hints are inaccurate about the return value for the empty string.

Given this discrepancy, the original assessment claiming correctness can no longer be sustained because the output hints incorrectly suggest that the function returns `True` for an empty string.

Final: **False**
