According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. Since `s` is specified to be a non-empty string, the loop will execute as long as `s` has at least one character. At the start of the loop, `char` will be the first character in the string `s`. The states that need to be considered are `s`, `first_char`, and `char`.

Therefore, for the loop to execute:
- `s` is a non-empty string.
- `first_char` is the first character of `s`.
- `char` will be initialized to the first character, which is `first_char`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is `first_char`**
