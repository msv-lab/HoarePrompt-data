#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string consisting of characters.
def func_1(s):
    return len(set(s)) == 1
    #The program returns True if all characters in string 's' are the same, and False otherwise
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and checks if all characters in `s` are the same. It returns `True` if they are identical and `False` otherwise. This includes cases where `s` is empty, which will also return `True` since there are no different characters.
