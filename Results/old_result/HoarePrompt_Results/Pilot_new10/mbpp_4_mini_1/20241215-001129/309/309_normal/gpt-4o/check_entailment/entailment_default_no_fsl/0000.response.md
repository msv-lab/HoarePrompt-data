Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for the case when an empty string is provided. According to the problem description, the function should return True if the string is empty. However, the implementation currently returns True in this case, which is correct, but the function does not handle the case of strings containing only whitespace characters correctly. For example, `func_1('   ')` should return False, as all characters (spaces) are technically the same, but it should return False because the function is about checking characters rather than considering whitespace as valid unique characters.

Additionally, the problem description may imply that strings consisting of identical characters, including special or non-visible characters, should also return True if all characters are the same (e.g., `func_1('\n\n\n')`).

Therefore, since there are cases like a string containing only whitespace or other characters that could be treated as the same but are non-visible which can lead to incorrect behavior, I conclude that the function is not correctly implemented for some edge cases and does not meet the requirements in every potential case.
