Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly adheres to the problem description, which states that the function must check whether all characters in a given string are the same. 

Here's how it works:

1. The function `func_1` takes a single argument, `s`, which is expected to be a string.
2. It creates a set from the string `s` using `set(s)`. In Python, a set is a collection of unique elements. Therefore, if all characters in the string are the same, the resulting set will contain exactly one unique character.
3. The function then checks whether the length of this set is equal to 1, returning `True` if this condition holds (indicating that all characters are the same) and `False` otherwise.

This behavior meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, including:
- An empty string (returns `True`, as there are no differing characters).
- A string with one character (returns `True`, as all characters are the same).
- A string with multiple characters, where all characters are the same (returns `True`).
- A string with at least one differing character (returns `False`).

Thus, the implementation is correct and fulfills the criteria outlined in the problem description.
