The output hints indicate that the function `func_1` does not handle the case of an empty list or lists containing non-integer values. This potentially leads to undefined behavior or exceptions if such inputs are provided. 

The original assessment claimed that the program is correct because all given examples worked correctly. However, it failed to consider these cases where the input might not be valid. Since the problem description doesn't specify handling of these edge cases, and the implementation can potentially lead to errors, the initial assessment should not be considered accurate.

Given the information, the program is not robust against invalid input, thus not entirely fulfilling the problem requirements.

Final: **False**
