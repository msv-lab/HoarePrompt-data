The code assigns the minimum value of the list `arr` to the variable `min_val`. Since `arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` will hold the smallest integer from that list. The values of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `min_val` is the minimum value of `arr`**
