Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the edge case of an empty list. If the input `arr` is empty, calling `max(arr)` or `min(arr)` will raise a `ValueError`, which means the program will fail and not return a valid result as required by the problem description. For example, if you call `func_1([])`, it will raise an error instead of providing a maximum difference. Hence, it does not meet the requirements for every potential case.
