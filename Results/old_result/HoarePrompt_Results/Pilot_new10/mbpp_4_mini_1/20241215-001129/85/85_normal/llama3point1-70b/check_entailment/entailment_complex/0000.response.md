Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it does not handle the edge case of an empty list. When the input list `arr` is empty, calling `max(arr)` or `min(arr)` will raise a `ValueError`, which is not addressed in the implementation. 

The problem description asks for a function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, if the array is empty, there are no elements to find a difference between, and thus the function cannot fulfill the requirement without raising an error.

For example, if we call `func_1([])`, the function will throw an exception instead of returning a valid output. Since the program fails to handle this important case, it does not correctly implement the problem requirements.
