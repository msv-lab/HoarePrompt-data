You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the function and see if it meets all possible cases.

### Problem description:
**Write a python function to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array.**

### Program:
```python
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
```

### Analysis:
1. The function `func_1` calculates the maximum difference by finding the maximum and minimum values in the array and returning their difference.
2. The maximum difference between any two elements in an array can be defined as `max(element) - min(element)`. This is a valid approach.

### Potential cases:
1. **Empty array (`[]`)**: 
   - Calling `max()` and `min()` on an empty list will raise a `ValueError` since there are no elements to compare. This violates the requirement that the function must work for any given array.

2. **Single element array (`[1]`)**:
   - The maximum and minimum would both be `1`, thus the output would be `0`. This is correct, as the difference of a single element with itself is `0`.
   
3. **Two elements array (`[1, 2]`)**:
   - The output would be `1`, as expected.
   
4. **Array with negative numbers (`[-5, -1, -3]`)**:
   - The maximum is `-1` and the minimum is `-5`, which gives a difference of `4`. This works as expected.

5. **Array with duplicate elements (`[5, 5, 5]`)**:
   - The output would be `0`, which is also correct.

Based on the analysis, the program does not handle the case of an empty array, where calling `max` or `min` would raise an exception.

### Conclusion:
The function does not work correctly for all inputs, particularly for an empty list, which violates the requirement of producing a result for any provided array.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers.
def func_1(arr):
    return max(arr) - min(arr)
    #The program returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list 'arr'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, and returns the difference between the maximum and minimum values in the list. However, if `arr` is empty, calling `max()` or `min()` will raise a ValueError. Therefore, the function does not handle the edge case of an empty list. If `arr` is empty, an error will occur.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
