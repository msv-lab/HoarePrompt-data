Final: **False** 

The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` is correct, but it neglected to adequately address the edge case of handling an empty list. The function indeed raises a `ValueError` when it encounters an empty list, which means it does not gracefully handle all potential inputs as expected by the problem description. While the logic for finding the maximum difference between elements is functionally correct when valid inputs are provided, the failure to address the situation of an empty input means that it does not adhere to an acceptable standard of robustness for handling all potential cases of input. Therefore, the original assessment is inaccurate.
