Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly finds the maximum difference between any two elements in the given array. The logic in the function `func_1(arr)` is sound, as it computes the minimum and maximum values of the array, then calculates the difference between these two values. 

The annotations confirm that the input to the function is a valid list of integers and that the function returns the expected output, which matches the assertions. The program handles various scenarios correctly, as shown by the test cases provided in the assertions.

Since the assessments, the problem description, and the annotated version of the code all align in indicating that the function operates correctly, I conclude that the program is indeed correct.
