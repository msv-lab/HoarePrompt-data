Correctness: **True**

The program correctly finds the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array. It does this by calculating the maximum value in the array using `max(arr)` and the minimum value using `min(arr)`, then returns the difference between these two values. 

This approach is valid because the maximum difference between any two elements in an array is indeed the difference between the largest and smallest elements. Therefore, for any array of integers:

1. If the array has two or more elements, this method will yield the correct maximum difference.
2. If the array has only one element, the difference between the maximum and minimum (which will be the same) will be 0, which is still a valid output.
3. If the array is empty, the behavior of `max()` and `min()` will raise an error, but the problem description does not mention handling for empty arrays, so it only needs to be verified against the description and not necessarily operationally complete for all inputs.

Thus, since the program meets the requirements of the problem description for any valid non-empty list of integers, it is correct.
