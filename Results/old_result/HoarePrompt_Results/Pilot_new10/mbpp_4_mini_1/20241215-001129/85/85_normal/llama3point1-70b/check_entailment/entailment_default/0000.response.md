Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The code attempts to find the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by using the built-in `max()` and `min()` functions. However, as the output hints indicate, the function does not handle the edge case of an empty list. If `arr` is empty, calling `max(arr)` or `min(arr)` will raise a ValueError. This means that for the input case of an empty list `[]`, the function does not perform as required by the problem description, leading to incorrect behavior. Thus, the program does not meet all requirements for every potential case, resulting in a determination of incorrectness.
