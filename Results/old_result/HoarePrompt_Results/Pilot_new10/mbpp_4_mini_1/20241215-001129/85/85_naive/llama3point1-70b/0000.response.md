Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly calculates the maximum difference between any two elements in a given array by using the expression `max(arr) - min(arr)`. This works because the maximum difference between elements can only be obtained by taking the maximum and minimum values of the array. 

The edge cases considered include:
1. If the array is empty, the function would raise a `ValueError` since `max()` and `min()` cannot operate on an empty sequence. This means the program does not handle the empty array case, which should return a specific indication of failure (like `None` or a specific message).
2. If there is only one element in the array, the maximum difference would be `0` because the maximum and minimum values would be the same.

However, since the description does not specify how to handle edge cases like empty lists or single-element arrays, the function behaves correctly as per a standard interpretation of finding the maximum difference based on available elements. 

Thus, unless specified how to handle such edge cases, the code can be considered as correctly fulfilling the primary requirement.
