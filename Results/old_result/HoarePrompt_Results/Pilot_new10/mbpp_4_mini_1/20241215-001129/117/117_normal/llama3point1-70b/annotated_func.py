#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list that may contain any type of elements, and the function should count only the integer elements within that list.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(isinstance(x, int) for x in lst)
    #The program returns the count of integer elements in the list 'lst' by summing the boolean values resulting from checking if each element is an instance of int.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` that may contain elements of any type, and it returns the count of integer elements within that list. The function does not handle cases where `lst` is not a list, nor does it account for nested lists or elements that may contain integers.
