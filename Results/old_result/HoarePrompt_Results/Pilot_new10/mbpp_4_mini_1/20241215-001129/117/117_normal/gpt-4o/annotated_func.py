#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list that may contain any type of elements, and the function will count only the integer elements within it.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))
    #The program returns the count of integer elements in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and returns the count of integer elements within that list. It does not consider elements of any other type, and can handle lists containing mixed types, including empty lists, gracefully by returning a count of zero if no integers are present.
