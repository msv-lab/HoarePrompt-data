Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as an argument, complying with the description that requires a function to operate on a list.

2. **Counting Integer Elements**: The function uses a generator expression to iterate through each element `x` in the list `lst` and checks if `x` is an instance of `int` using `isinstance(x, int)`. For each integer found, this expression evaluates to `True` (1), and for non-integers, it evaluates to `False` (0).

3. **Summation of Boolean Values**: The `sum` function then adds up all the boolean values produced by the generator expression, effectively counting the number of integer elements in the list. This approach accurately reflects the requirement of counting integer elements as specified.

4. **Comprehensive Coverage**: The program correctly handles any variation in element types within the list, ensuring that only integers are counted. It will yield zero for an empty list and correctly handle cases with mixed types (e.g., strings, floats, etc.).

Since the program accurately performs the task defined in the problem description of counting the integer elements in the provided list, the correctness of the function is affirmed.
