You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3
assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2

def func_1(lst):
    return sum((1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(lst)` correctly counts the number of integer elements in the given list `lst`. It uses a generator expression that iterates over the elements of the list and checks if each element is an instance of an integer using `isinstance(x, int)`. It sums up the results of this expression to give the total count of integers.

The provided assertions also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the test cases given:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` correctly returns `2`, because there are two integers (`1` and `2`).
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3])` correctly returns `3`, since all three elements are integers.
3. `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` correctly returns `2`, as `1` and `4` are integers, while `1.2` and `5.1` are not.

The program correctly handles various types of inputs, such as integers, floats, and strings. No edge cases are left unaddressed, and thus the program fulfills the requirements as stated in the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3
assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list that may contain any type of elements, and the function will count only the integer elements within it.
def func_1(lst):
    return sum(1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int))
    #The program returns the count of integer elements in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and returns the count of integer elements within that list. It does not consider elements of any other type, and can handle lists containing mixed types, including empty lists, gracefully by returning a count of zero if no integers are present.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
