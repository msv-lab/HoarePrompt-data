Correctness: **False**

The provided program contains an issue related to how it identifies integer elements. It employs `isinstance(x, int)` to check for integers, which is correct for positive and negative integers, but it will not account for `bool` types in Python. In Python, the boolean values `True` and `False` are considered as integers (`1` and `0`, respectively). This means that if the list contains boolean values, they will be counted as integers, which contradicts the expectation described in the problem statement and the output hints.

For example, if we test the function with the input `func_1([True, False])`, the output would be counted as `2`, because `True` and `False` are both evaluated as integers, which is not aligned with the requirement to count only actual integer elements.

Thus, the function fails to meet the problem description for every potential case.
