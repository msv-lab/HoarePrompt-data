The program is designed to count the number of integer elements in a provided list. It uses a generator expression with the `sum` function to iterate through the list and counts elements that are instances of the `int` type.

The given test cases are:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2])` should return 2, which successfully counts 1 and 2 as integers.
2. `func_1([1, 2, 3])` should return 3, which correctly counts all three elements as integers.
3. `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` should return 2, counting 1 and 4 as integers.

The output hints indicate that the function should return the count of integer elements in the list, excluding non-integer types, and that it can handle mixed-type lists or empty lists.

Upon reviewing, the logic implemented in the function is consistent with the problem description and the examples provided. There is no edge case presented in the provided examples that would lead to a failure in counting integers. 

Therefore, the program seems to behave as expected for all potential cases specified, including handling of mixed types correctly.

Correctness: **True**.
