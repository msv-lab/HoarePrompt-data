Correctness: **False**

The program is not entirely correct according to the problem description. While the function does accurately count the integer elements in a given list, it does not handle the case where the input `lst` is not actually a list. This means that if an input is passed that is not a list (for example, a string or a number), the function can fail with an error, thus not fulfilling the requirement of robustness as implied in the problem description.

Additionally, the program does not account for nested lists or elements that may contain integers, which means that if there are integers within a sublist, they will not be counted. The problem description does not specify that the input will only contain flat lists, so the function's limitations in this respect further deviate from its requirements.

In these ways, the program does not meet the problem description requirements for all potential cases. Hence, the correctness of the program is in question, leading to the conclusion that it is false.
