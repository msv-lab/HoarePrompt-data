To determine the correctness of the provided program according to the given problem description, let's analyze it.

### Problem Description:
Write a python function that returns the number of integer elements in a given list.

### Provided Program:
```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 'abc', 1.2]) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 3]) == 3
assert func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1]) == 2

def func_1(lst):
    return sum((1 for x in lst if isinstance(x, int)))
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Logic**: The function `func_1(lst)` uses a generator expression to check each element in the list `lst` to see if it is an instance of an integer (`isinstance(x, int)`), and it sums the number of `True` results (which are counted as `1`).

2. **Example Assertions**:
   - The first assertion checks a list with two integers: `1` and `2`, which is expected to return `2`. 
   - The second assertion checks a list of three integers: `1`, `2`, and `3`, which correctly returns `3`.
   - The third assertion with `1, 1.2, 4, 5.1` contains only one integer (`4`), but the assertion states it should yield `2`, which is incorrect.

### Potential Error Case:
The third assertion is incorrect. It states that `func_1([1, 1.2, 4, 5.1])` should return `2`, but there is only one integer in this list, which is `4`. Therefore, the function should return `1`.

### Conclusion:
Since at least one input case fails to match the expected outcome, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
