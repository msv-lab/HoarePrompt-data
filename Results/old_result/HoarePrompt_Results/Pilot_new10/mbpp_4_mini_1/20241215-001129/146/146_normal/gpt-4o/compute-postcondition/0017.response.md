The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list containing sublists, where each sublist can contain any type of elements. The function returns two values: `max_len`, which is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `max_list`, which is that longest sublist. If `list_of_lists` is empty, then `max_len` is 0 and `max_list` is an empty list. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of sublists and return the length and the content of the longest sublist or return 0 and an empty list if no sublists are present. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists and returns the length of the longest sublist and that sublist itself. If list_of_lists is empty, it returns 0 and an empty list.**
