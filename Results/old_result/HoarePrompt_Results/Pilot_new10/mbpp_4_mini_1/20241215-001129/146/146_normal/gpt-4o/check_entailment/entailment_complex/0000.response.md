Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to find the list of maximum length in a list of lists.

Here's a breakdown of why the program is correct:

1. **Initialization**: The function initializes two variables, `max_len` and `max_list`, to keep track of the maximum length found and the corresponding sublist. This is essential for storing the result as the iteration progresses.

2. **Iteration**: The program iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists`:

   - It checks the length of the current sublist (`len(lst)`) against `max_len`.
   - If the current sublist is longer than the previously recorded maximum (`max_len`), it updates `max_len` with the new maximum and assigns `max_list` to the current sublist (`lst`).

3. **Return Value**: After iterating through all the sublists, the function returns a tuple of `max_len` and `max_list`. If the input list is empty, the function correctly returns `(0, [])`, which aligns with the expected output specified in the annotations and the problem description.

4. **Assertions**: The assertions provided correctly demonstrate the expected behavior of the function. Each test checks that the function returns not only the length of the longest list but also the list itself.

The function has been crafted to handle all potential cases outlined in the problem description, including the case where the input list of lists is empty, ensuring it returns `(0, [])` as required.

Thus, the implementation accurately conforms to the requirements set forth in the problem description.
