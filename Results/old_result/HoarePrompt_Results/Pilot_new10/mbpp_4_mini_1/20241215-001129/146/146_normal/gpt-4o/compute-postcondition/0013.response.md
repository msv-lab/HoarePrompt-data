The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `lst`. Since `max_list` is empty before the assignment, it will now reference the same object as `lst`, which is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`. The previous value of `max_len`, which is equal to the length of `lst`, remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `max_len`, `max_list`, and `lst`.

Output State: **`max_len` is equal to the length of `lst`, `max_list` is equal to `lst`, `lst` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
