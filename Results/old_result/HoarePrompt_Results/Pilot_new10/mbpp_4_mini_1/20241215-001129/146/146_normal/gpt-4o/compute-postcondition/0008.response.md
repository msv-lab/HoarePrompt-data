In this case, `max_len` is assigned the value of the length of `lst`. Since `lst` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `list_of_lists` must have at least 2 sublists, we know that `lst` is not empty. The length of `lst` will thus be a non-negative integer. 

The values of `max_list` and `lst` remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` is an empty list, `lst` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` is an empty list, `lst` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`**.
