#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list containing sublists, each of which can be of varying lengths.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max(len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists)
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len
    ]
    return max_len, max_sublists[0]
    #The program returns the maximum length of the sublists in 'list_of_lists' and the first sublist from 'max_sublists' which contains sublists of that maximum length.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists as input and returns two values: the maximum length of the sublists within the list and the first sublist that has this maximum length. If the input list is empty or contains only empty sublists, it could raise a `ValueError` when attempting to find the maximum length, and therefore should be handled. The function does not account for the case when all sublists are empty, which would result in an error.
