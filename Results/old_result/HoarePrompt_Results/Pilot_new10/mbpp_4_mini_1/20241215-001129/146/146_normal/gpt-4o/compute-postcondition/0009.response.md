The code assigns the value of `lst` to `max_list`. The variable `max_list` now holds the reference to the same list as `lst`, which is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output will reflect that `max_list` now holds the value of `lst`.

Output State: **`max_len` is the length of `lst`, `max_list` is the same as `lst`, `lst` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
