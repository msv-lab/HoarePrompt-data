Final: **False** 

Reason: The original assessment accurately identifies an issue with the program, specifically its lack of handling for an empty input list. Even though the assumption is that valid input will be provided, all potential edge cases should ideally be addressed for a robust implementation. The program's inability to handle this case results in an exception, demonstrating that it does not satisfactorily meet the requirements of the problem description.
