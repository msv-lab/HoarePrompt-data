Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully comply with the problem description. While the function aims to find the maximum length of the sublists and return the first sublist that has this maximum length, it has several shortcomings:

1. **Error Handling**: The program does not handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty or contains only empty sublists. In such scenarios, the `max()` function would raise a `ValueError`. This violates the requirement to robustly find the list of maximum length.

2. **Returning the Maximum Length Only**: The problem description requires finding the list of maximum length in a list of lists, suggesting that if there are multiple sublists of maximum length, they should all be collected. However, the implementation only returns the first sublist of maximum length, which is not aligned with a logical interpretation of "finding the list of maximum length."

3. **Output Format**: The problem description implies a need for the function to return a list (or lists) of maximum length sublists, but the implementation returns a tuple containing the maximum length and just the first sublist.

Due to these issues, the program does not behave correctly under all circumstances as mandated by the problem description.
