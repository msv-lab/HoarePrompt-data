To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program meets the requirements specified.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that finds the list of maximum length in a list of lists.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_len = max((len(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists))
    max_sublists = [sublist for sublist in list_of_lists if len(sublist) == max_len]
    return (max_len, max_sublists[0])
```

### Analysis:
1. The program uses a generator expression to find the maximum length (`max_len`) of the sublists in `list_of_lists`.
2. It creates a list (`max_sublists`) of all sublists that have this maximum length.
3. The function returns a tuple containing `max_len` and the first sublist in `max_sublists`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- **Empty Input:** 
    - If `list_of_lists` is empty (`[]`), the `max` function will raise a `ValueError` since it cannot compute the maximum of an empty sequence.
  
- **Multiple Sublists with the Same Length:** 
    - The program returns only the first sublist that matches the maximum length. This is acceptable according to the problem description assuming it asks for "the list of maximum length." However, if the description implied a need to return all maximum sublists, the implementation would be incorrect.

### Conclusion:
While the implementation handles most cases correctly, it fails to handle the case where `list_of_lists` is empty. Thus, the program does not comply with the problem description in all potential scenarios.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Reason:
If `list_of_lists` is empty, the function will throw an error when trying to calculate `max_len`.
