The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers that contains at least two elements. If the unique integers in `nums` are fewer than two, the function returns `None`. If there are at least two unique integers, the function returns the second smallest unique integer from the list of unique integers derived from `nums`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers `nums` and either return the second smallest unique integer or `None` if there aren't enough unique integers. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers nums and returns None if there are fewer than two unique integers in nums. If there are at least two unique integers, it returns the second smallest unique integer.**
