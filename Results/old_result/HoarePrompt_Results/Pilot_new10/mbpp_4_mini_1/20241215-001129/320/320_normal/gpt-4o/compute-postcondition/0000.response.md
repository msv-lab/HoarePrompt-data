The code takes the list of integers `nums`, creates a set from it to remove any duplicates, and then sorts the unique integers. This results in a new list `unique_nums`. The state of `nums` remains unchanged, but the `unique_nums` variable now holds the sorted unique values from `nums`. 

Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `unique_nums` is a sorted list of unique integers derived from `nums`.**
