You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the second smallest number in a list.
Program:
```
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if len(unique_nums) < 2:
        return None
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly identifies the second smallest unique number in a list. Hereâ€™s why it works for all potential cases:

1. It converts the list into a set to remove duplicates, ensuring only unique elements are considered.
2. If the length of the unique list is less than 2, it correctly returns `None`, indicating that there is no second smallest number.
3. For lists with at least two unique numbers, it sorts the unique elements and returns the second smallest number by indexing.

This logic correctly handles edge cases like:
- A list with all identical numbers (returns `None`).
- A list with exactly two unique numbers (correctly returns the larger one).
- Negative numbers and mixed positive/negative numbers (sorts and identifies the second smallest regardless of sign).

Thus, it satisfies the requirements of the problem description for every potential input case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers with at least two elements.
def func_1(nums):
    unique_nums = list(set(nums))
    if (len(unique_nums) < 2) :
        return None
        #The program returns None because the current length of 'unique_nums' is less than 2, indicating not enough unique integers in 'nums'.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers with at least two elements; `unique_nums` is a list of unique integers derived from `nums`, and the length of `unique_nums` is greater than or equal to 2.
    return sorted(unique_nums)[1]
    #The program returns the second smallest unique integer from the list of unique integers derived from 'nums', which has at least two elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` with at least two elements. It returns None if there are fewer than two unique integers in `nums`. If there are at least two unique integers, it returns the second smallest unique integer from `nums`. If there are exactly two unique integers, it will return the larger one as the second smallest value. The code handles edge cases where less than two unique integers are present properly.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
