Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case where the input string starts with an underscore or contains consecutive underscores. For example:

- Input: `"_my_var"` should return `"MyVar"`, but the current function would return `"MyVar"` which is correct.
- Input: `"my__variable"` should produce `"MyVariable"` according to camel case rules (where only single underscores separate words), but the function will return `"MyVariable"` without addressing that `my__variable` implies a potential error in naming convention.

Additionally, if the input string is empty or contains only underscores (like `"___"`), the function will return an empty string, which is not specified in the problem description and may not be what is expected. Thus, the program doesn't handle edge cases correctly.

Therefore, since it does not correctly process all edge cases, the function is deemed incorrect.
