Correctness: **False**

The provided function, `func_1`, does not correctly convert a snake_case string to camelCase as required by the problem description. 

**Explanation of why it is incorrect:**
1. The function splits the input string on underscores and capitalizes each component. However, it fails to ensure that the first component (the first word) of the resulting string is not capitalized, which is a key aspect of camelCase.
2. A correct transformation from snake_case to camelCase should capitalize the first letter of each subsequent word after the first word while keeping the first word in lowercase.

For example, for the input `python_program`, the expected output in camelCase is `pythonProgram`, but the current implementation would output `PythonProgram`, which does not follow the camelCase convention. 

Thus, the function does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that the program is incorrect.
