Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input string may have leading or trailing underscores, which could lead to empty components being capitalized and included in the resulting output. For example, the input `'_snake_case_'` would incorrectly produce `SnakeCase`, including empty strings as components. Additionally, while the precondition states there will be at least one underscore, the implementation fails to validate or manage cases with empty components effectively. Thus, it does not fulfill the problem description requirements for all potential cases.
