The variable `words` is assigned the result of splitting the string `snake_case_str` by underscores (`_`). Since `snake_case_str` contains only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores, and does not start or end with an underscore, the splitting operation will yield a list of substrings that were separated by the underscores. The state of `snake_case_str` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`snake_case_str` is a string that contains only lowercase letters, numbers, and underscores, and does not start or end with an underscore; `words` is a list of substrings split by underscores from `snake_case_str`.**
