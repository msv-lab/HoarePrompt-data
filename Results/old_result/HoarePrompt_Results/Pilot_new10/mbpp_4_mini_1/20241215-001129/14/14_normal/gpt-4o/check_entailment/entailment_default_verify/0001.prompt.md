You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 4]) == True
assert func_1([1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]) == True

def func_1(arr):
    seen = set()
    for num in arr:
        if num in seen:
            return True
        seen.add(num)
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether there are any duplicate elements in the given array of integers. The logic of the function is as follows:

1. It initializes an empty set called `seen`.
2. It iterates through each number in the input array `arr`.
3. For each number, it checks if that number is already in the `seen` set.
   - If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate has been found.
   - If it is not, the number is added to the `seen` set.
4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the function returns `False`.

The function has been tested with the following assertions, which cover various cases:
- A case with no duplicates: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` correctly returns `False`.
- A case with duplicates: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]` correctly returns `True`.
- A case with multiple duplicates: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]` correctly returns `True`.

Since these assertions validate that the function behaves as expected for different scenarios, and no potential edge cases render it incorrect, the function can be considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of integers and returns True if any integer appears more than once; otherwise, it returns False, including for the case of an empty list which also returns False. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
