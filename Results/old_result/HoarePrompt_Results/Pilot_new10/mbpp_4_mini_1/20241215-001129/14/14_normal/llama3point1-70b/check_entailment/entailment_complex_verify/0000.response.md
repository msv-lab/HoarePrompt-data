The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect due to its return values being counterintuitive to what might be expected, based on the function's naming. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it becomes clear that the function does correctly perform its intended task: identifying whether there are duplicates in the provided list of integers. The annotations explicitly state that the program returns `True` when there are duplicates, which aligns with the specific outcome that the problem description requires.

While the function's naming may create some confusion regarding the returned boolean values, it does not negate the correctness of the logic used to check for duplicates. The main point of the assessment was whether the function works as intended based on the problem description, which it does.

Therefore, I conclude that the original assessment was not accurate.

Final: **True**
