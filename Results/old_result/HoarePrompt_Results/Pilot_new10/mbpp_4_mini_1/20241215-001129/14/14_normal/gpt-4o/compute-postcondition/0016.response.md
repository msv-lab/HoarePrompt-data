The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `arr`. `arr` is a list of integers. The function can return different values based on specific conditions:

- Case 1: If certain conditions are met, the function returns `True`, indicating that a specific integer is present in a collection.
- Case 2: If the second integer in the list `arr` is found in a specific set, the function returns `True`.
- Case 3: The function has another condition that leads it to return `True`.
- Case 4: If none of the previous conditions are satisfied, the function returns `False`, indicating that a condition was not met.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and return `True` under specific conditions or return `False` if none of these conditions are satisfied. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr, a list of integers, and returns True under specific conditions or False if none of the conditions are met.**
