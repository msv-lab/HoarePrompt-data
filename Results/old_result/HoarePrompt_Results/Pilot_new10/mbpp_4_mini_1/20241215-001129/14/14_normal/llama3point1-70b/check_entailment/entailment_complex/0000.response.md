Correctness: **False**

The reason the program does not fully meet the problem description is that it returns `True` when duplicates are found, which is the opposite of what is typically expected. The problem description asks for a function that determines if there are any duplicate elements in the given array of integers. 

According to the common understanding of such a function, we usually expect the function to return `True` if duplicates exist and `False` if there are none. In this implementation, however, it returns `True` if duplicates are found (which suggests that the condition is met) but is misleading since the typical expectation is that `True` should indicate the absence of duplicates.

To summarize, the main issue is:
- The function's return values are inverted in relation to standard expectations regarding duplicates. It should return `True` for duplicates and `False` otherwise, but the implementation does the opposite. Therefore, it fails to meet the problem description as specified.
