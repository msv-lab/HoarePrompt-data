Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(arr)` correctly implements the logic necessary to identify duplicates in a list of integers as described in the problem statement. It efficiently uses a set to track seen numbers, returning `True` upon finding a duplicate and returning `False` if no duplicates are found after checking the entire input list.

Additionally, the output hints reinforce that the function behaves correctly, specifying that it will return `False` for an empty list, which is consistent with the function's logic. All provided test cases support the function's correctness, demonstrating proper functionality for both lists with duplicates and without duplicates.
