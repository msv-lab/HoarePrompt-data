Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly identifies whether there are any duplicate elements in the given array of integers based on the provided problem description. The annotations confirm that the function initializes an empty set, iterates through the input list, and checks for duplicates effectively. The annotations also clarify that when the loop has completed, if no duplicates were found, the function correctly returns `False`. The test cases validate the correctness of the implementation, confirming that it reliably distinguishes between lists with and without duplicates. Therefore, the function behaves as expected, leading to the conclusion that the program's correctness assessment should remain true.
