You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find whether a given array of integers contains any duplicate element.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr):
    return len(arr) != len(set(arr))


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program checks for duplicates by comparing the length of the original array `arr` with the length of a set created from that array. However, the program returns `True` if there are duplicates and `False` if there are not, which is opposite to what we would typically expect. 

For example, with the input `arr = [1, 2, 3, 4]`, it would return `False` (indicating no duplicates) as `len(arr)` equals `len(set(arr))`. However, in terms of the function's naming and typical logic, one would expect a function named `contains_duplicates` to return `True` if duplicates are present. 

Thus, for the input `[1, 2, 2, 4]`, it would return `True` which would mean duplicates exist, as expected, but the return value's meaning can be confusing. Hence, even though the logic identifies the duplicates correctly, the expected output should align with typical interpretations, which the function does not fulfill correctly.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and returns `True` if there are duplicate integers in the list; otherwise, it returns `False`. It effectively checks for duplicates by comparing the length of the list to the length of the set created from that list, which contains only unique elements. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the code, as it correctly handles all cases of duplicate values in the input list. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
