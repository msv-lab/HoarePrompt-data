The `seen` variable is initialized as an empty set. The variable `arr` remains unchanged since no operations have been performed on it. Therefore, the Output State will reflect the unchanged list and the newly initialized empty set. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers, `seen` is an empty set**.
