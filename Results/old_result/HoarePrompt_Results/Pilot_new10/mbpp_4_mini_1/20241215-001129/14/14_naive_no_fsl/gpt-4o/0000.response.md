Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly identifies whether there are any duplicate elements in the given array of integers. The logic of the function is as follows:

1. It initializes an empty set called `seen`.
2. It iterates through each number in the input array `arr`.
3. For each number, it checks if that number is already in the `seen` set.
   - If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that a duplicate has been found.
   - If it is not, the number is added to the `seen` set.
4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicates, the function returns `False`.

The function has been tested with the following assertions, which cover various cases:
- A case with no duplicates: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` correctly returns `False`.
- A case with duplicates: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 4]` correctly returns `True`.
- A case with multiple duplicates: `[1, 1, 2, 2, 3, 3, 4, 4, 5]` correctly returns `True`.

Since these assertions validate that the function behaves as expected for different scenarios, and no potential edge cases render it incorrect, the function can be considered correct.
