Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to correctly assign `list1` to `list2` when `list1` is empty. Specifically, the line `list1 = list2` does not change `list1` in the scope of the function; it only makes the `list1` variable point to `list2` locally. As a result, the original `list1` passed in as an argument remains unchanged.

For example, if we call `func_1([], [1, 2, 3])`, the function will return `[]` instead of `[1, 2, 3]`. 

Thus, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description in every case.
