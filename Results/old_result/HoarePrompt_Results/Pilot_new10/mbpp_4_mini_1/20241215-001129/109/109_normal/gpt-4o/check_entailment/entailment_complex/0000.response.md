The program is incorrect according to the problem description.

Correctness: **False**

The problem description requires the function to "replace the last element of the first list with the elements of the second list." However, the implementation in the provided code returns a new list that consists of all elements from the first list except the last one, concatenated with all elements from the second list. This means that the last element of the first list is not replaced, but rather omitted completely.

### Example of Failure:
For example, if we take the input lists as:
```python
func_1([1, 2, 3], [4, 5])
```
The correct expected output based on the problem description would be:
```python
[1, 2, 4, 5]  # Here, the last element 3 is replaced by [4, 5]
```
However, the actual output of the function would be:
```python
[1, 2] + [4, 5] -> [1, 2, 4, 5]
```
This is incorrect because the last element of the first list (which is `3`) is omitted, rather than replaced.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to fulfill the requirement to replace the last element of the first list with the entirety of the second list. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description.
