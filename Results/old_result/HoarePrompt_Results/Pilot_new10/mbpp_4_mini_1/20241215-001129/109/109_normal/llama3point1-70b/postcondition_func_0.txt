The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`. It replaces the last element of `list1` with the entire contents of `list2`. If `list1` is empty (which won't occur according to the precondition stating that `list1` has at least one element), `list1` would instead reference `list2`. The function returns the modified `list1`.
