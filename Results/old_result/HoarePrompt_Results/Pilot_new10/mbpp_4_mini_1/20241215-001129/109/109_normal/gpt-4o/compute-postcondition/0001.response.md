The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists, and `list1` contains at least one element. After executing the function body, it returns a new list that consists of all elements of `list1` except the last one, concatenated with all elements of `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a concatenated list which includes all elements of `list1` except the last one, followed by all elements of `list2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, list1 and list2, and returns a concatenated list of elements from list1 (excluding the last element) and all elements from list2.**
