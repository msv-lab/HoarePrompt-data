Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to find the volume of a cone. 

### Explanation:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(radius, height)` is defined to take two parameters: `radius` and `height`. These parameters represent the dimensions of the cone.

2. **Volume Calculation**: The formula used in the return statement is:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h
   \]
   This is the correct mathematical formula for calculating the volume of a cone, where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height.

3. **Input Constraints**: The assertion comments indicate that the expected inputs for `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers (either float or integer). The function is designed to accommodate these input types, and its logic will handle any non-negative values correctly, adhering to the constraints.

4. **Validation with Tests**: The provided assertions validate the function against known test cases (e.g., a radius of 5 and height of 12 gives approximately 314.159, which is correct). These cases confirm that the implementation works as expected within the specified tolerances.

Thus, the program satisfies the requirements set forth in the problem description for every potential case of non-negative radius and height.
