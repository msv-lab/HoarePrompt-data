Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(radius, height)` correctly implements the formula for calculating the volume of a cone as \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \). The provided annotations confirm that the function parameters (radius and height) are expected to be non-negative floats or integers, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description. The assert statements successfully verify the function against expected results with appropriate tolerances for floating point comparisons, and the calculations have been validated to produce correct outputs for the given inputs. Thus, the program adheres to the problem description correctly, confirming its correctness.
