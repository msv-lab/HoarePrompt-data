The original assessment stated that the program is correct, but it did not consider the implications of the output hints. The output hints explicitly mention that the function does not handle invalid inputs, such as negative values or non-numeric types, and this could lead to runtime errors or unexpected behavior if such inputs are passed to the function.

While the mathematical calculations are accurate for the valid test cases provided, the failure to handle invalid inputs suggests that the program might not be robust in terms of input validation. This could lead to significant issues if used in a wider context where users might inadvertently provide incorrect values.

Given this additional consideration, the original assessment's focus on the correctness of the calculations does not account for the lack of input validation and handling of potential error cases. 

Therefore, the final correctness of the program should take these aspects into account.

Final: **False**
