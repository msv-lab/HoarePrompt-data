The original assessment states that the function `func_1` is correct because it computes the volume of a cone based on the mathematical formula provided. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` could be negative or non-numeric, which may lead to incorrect results or exceptions.

While the formula implemented in the function is mathematically correct, the potential invalid inputs (negative values for radius or height) are significant issues when considering the overall correctness of the program in a geometric context. A cone with negative dimensions does not make sense, and the function could produce misleading or erroneous results in those cases.

Considering the output hints and the fact that the original assessment overlooks the critical aspect of input validation, the original assessment seems overly generous.

Final: **False**
