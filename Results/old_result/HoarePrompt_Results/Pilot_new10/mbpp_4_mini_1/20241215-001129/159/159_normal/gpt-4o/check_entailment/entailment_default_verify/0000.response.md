Final: **False** 

The original assessment of correctness as **True** does not take into account the fact that the function `func_1` does not handle invalid inputs, such as negative values or non-numeric types. The output hints indicate that the function is only expected to work with non-negative floats or integers, which suggests that the program could raise runtime errors if such invalid inputs are provided. Therefore, while the function may correctly calculate the volume of a cone for valid, non-negative inputs, it does not meet the requirements to be considered fully correct due to its lack of input validation.
