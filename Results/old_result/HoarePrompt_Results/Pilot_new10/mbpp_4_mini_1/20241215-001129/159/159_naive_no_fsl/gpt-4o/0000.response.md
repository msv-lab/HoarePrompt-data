Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1(radius, height)` calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \), where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The provided assert statements are testing this function with three different sets of inputs, and all comparisons with expected outputs are using `math.isclose` to allow for minor floating point inaccuracies.

I reviewed the provided calculations:

1. For `func_1(5, 12)`: 
   - \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi (5^2) (12) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (25)(12) = 100\pi \approx 314.15926535897927 \)

2. For `func_1(10, 15)`:
   - \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi (10^2) (15) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (100)(15) = 500\pi \approx 1570.7963267948965 \)

3. For `func_1(19, 17)`:
   - \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi (19^2) (17) = \frac{1}{3} \pi (361)(17) = 2033.333\pi \approx 6426.651371693521 \)

In all test cases, the function produces the correct volume for a cone as per the mathematical formula, and there are no additional edge cases that the function appears to miss, such as handling negative or zero values explicitly since volumes cannot be negative and the formula would return zero for those cases.

As there are no examples where the program fails, it adheres to the problem description correctly.
