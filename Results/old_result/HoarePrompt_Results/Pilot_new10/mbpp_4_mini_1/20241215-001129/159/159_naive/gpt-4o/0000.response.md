Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the volume of a cone using the formula \( V = \frac{1}{3} \pi r^2 h \) where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The assertions check the function for specific values of radius and height, and the expected volumes are accurate based on the formula. Given that all test cases return the expected results and no additional edge cases or potential errors are present, the program meets the requirements set by the problem description.
