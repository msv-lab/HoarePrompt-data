You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove all whitespaces from a string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python  program') == 'pythonprogram'
assert func_1('python   programming    language') == 'pythonprogramminglanguage'
assert func_1('python                     program') == 'pythonprogram'
assert func_1('   python                     program') == 'pythonprogram'

def func_1(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(s)` uses the `replace` method to remove all whitespace characters from the string `s`. It specifically replaces spaces (' ') with an empty string (''), effectively removing them from the input.

The assertion tests:
1. `func_1('python  program')` correctly returns `'pythonprogram'`.
2. `func_1('python   programming    language')` correctly returns `'pythonprogramminglanguage'`.
3. `func_1('python                     program')` correctly returns `'pythonprogram'`.
4. `func_1('   python                     program')` correctly returns `'pythonprogram'`.

All these cases demonstrate that the function behaves correctly for varying amounts of whitespace. However, one potential edge case is that the function only removes spaces and does not account for other whitespace characters, such as tabs (`\t`) or new line characters (`\n`). If the input were to contain those characters, they would not be removed.

Example:
```python
func_1('python\t program\n')  # Expected output: 'pythonprogram', but this will output 'python\tprogram\n'
```

Thus, the function does not fully meet the problem description as it needs to remove all kinds of whitespace, not just spaces. Therefore, it is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a string `s` and returns the string with all spaces removed. It does not handle any other types of strings or special cases such as handling leading, trailing, or multiple consecutive spaces specifically, but it effectively removes all space characters. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
