Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as specified in the problem description. Specifically, while the function `func_1` removes spaces from the string effectively, it does not account for other whitespace characters (like tabs or newlines) and assumes that spaces are the only whitespace characters that need to be removed. 

For instance, consider the input:

```python
func_1('python\t program\n') 
```

This input contains a tab character (`\t`) and a newline character (`\n`), which the function fails to remove. The expected output should be 'pythonprogram', but since the function only replaces space characters, it will return 'python\tprogram\n', which is incorrect. Hence, the function does not meet the requirements of removing all types of whitespace.
