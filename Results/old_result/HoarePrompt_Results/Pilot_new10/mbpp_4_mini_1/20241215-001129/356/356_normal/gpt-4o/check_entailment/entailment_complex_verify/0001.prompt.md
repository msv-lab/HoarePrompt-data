You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to remove all whitespaces from a string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('python  program') == 'pythonprogram'
assert func_1('python   programming    language') == 'pythonprogramminglanguage'
assert func_1('python                     program') == 'pythonprogram'
assert func_1('   python                     program') == 'pythonprogram'

def func_1(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '')


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all potential cases of whitespace removal as stated in the problem description. It only replaces single spaces (' ') with an empty string ('') but does not account for other types of whitespace characters, such as tabs ('\t') or newlines ('\n'). 

For example, if the input string is:

```python
'python\tprogram'
```

or 

```python
'python\nprogram'
```

the expected output should still be `'pythonprogram'`, but the current implementation would retain the tab or newline characters. Therefore, since there are cases where the program does not fulfill the requirement of removing all whitespaces, the correctness is deemed false.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1('python  program') == 'pythonprogram'
assert func_1('python   programming    language') == 'pythonprogramminglanguage'
assert func_1('python                     program') == 'pythonprogram'
assert func_1('   python                     program') == 'pythonprogram'

#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    return s.replace(' ', '')
    #The program returns the string 's' with all spaces removed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns the string with all spaces removed. It does not handle any other types of strings or special cases such as handling leading, trailing, or multiple consecutive spaces specifically, but it effectively removes all space characters.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
