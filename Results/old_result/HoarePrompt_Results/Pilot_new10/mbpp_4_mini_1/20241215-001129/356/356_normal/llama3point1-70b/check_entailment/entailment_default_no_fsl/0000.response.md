Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it only removes spaces (' ') from the string, but it does not handle other types of whitespace characters such as tabs (`\t`), newlines (`\n`), or multiple spaces. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to remove *all* whitespaces, not just spaces. Therefore, cases like a string containing tabs or newlines would not be handled correctly, and would lead to incorrect results. For instance, `func_1("Hello\tWorld\n")` would return "Hello\tWorld\n", which does not meet the requirement of removing all whitespace characters.
