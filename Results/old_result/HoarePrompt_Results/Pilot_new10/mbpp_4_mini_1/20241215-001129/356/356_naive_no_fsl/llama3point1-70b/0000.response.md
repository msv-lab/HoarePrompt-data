The provided program removes only spaces from the input string. However, it does not handle other types of whitespace characters such as tabs (`\t`) and newlines (`\n`). 

For example, if the input string is `"Hello\tWorld\n"`, the function would return `"HelloWorld\n"`, which still contains a newline character. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to remove all whitespaces, which implies that it should also remove tabs and newlines in addition to regular spaces.

Therefore, the function does not fully meet the requirements stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
