Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to find the area of a rectangle as described in the problem description. Here's why it adheres to the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `length` and `width`, which are intended to represent the dimensions of a rectangle.

2. **Calculation of Area**: The area of a rectangle is calculated by multiplying its length by its width. This is accurately implemented in the line `return length * width`.

3. **Preconditions**: The annotated comments clarify that the inputs `length` and `width` are expected to be non-negative numbers. The function operates under the presumption that these conditions are met, as stated.

4. **Correctness of Assertions**: The assertions demonstrate various test cases that check if the function returns the correct area for different combinations of length and width, all of which produce the expected results.

5. **Lack of Negative Input Handling**: While the program does not explicitly handle negative inputs or invalid data types, the preconditions stated in the comments imply that such cases are not expected. Thus, it aligns with the problem requirements by operating under the assumption that inputs will always be valid as per the precondition.

Therefore, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description, and we conclude that the program is correct.
