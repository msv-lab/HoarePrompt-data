You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the area of a rectangle.
Program:
```
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the formula for calculating the area of a rectangle, which is given by the product of its length and width. For all valid numerical inputs (whether they are positive, negative, or zero), the function will return the correct mathematical result for the area. 

Here are some reasoning points to support this conclusion:

1. **Positive Inputs**: For positive values of length and width, the returned result will be a positive area, which is correct.
   - Example: `func_1(5, 10)` returns `50` which is the correct area.

2. **Zero Input**: If either the length or width is zero, the area will be zero, which is accurate.
   - Example: `func_1(0, 10)` returns `0`.

3. **Negative Inputs**: Area can be mathematically considered to be negative if negative dimensions are used, but in practical scenarios, a rectangle cannot have negative dimensions. The program does not enforce non-negative values, but it will still multiply the numbers correctly.
   - Example: `func_1(-5, 10)` returns `-50`, highlighting the limitation in practical sense. 

Given the program calculates the area by multiplication and does not handle validation for dimensions, it does implement the requirement as stated in the problem description without any logical errors in calculation. Thus, based on the consideration of all potential cases, the program is deemed correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative numbers representing the dimensions of the rectangle.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the area of the rectangle calculated as length multiplied by width, where length and width are non-negative numbers representing the dimensions of the rectangle.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
