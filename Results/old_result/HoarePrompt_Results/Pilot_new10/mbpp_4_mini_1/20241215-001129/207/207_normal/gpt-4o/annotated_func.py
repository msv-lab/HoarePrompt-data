#State of the program right berfore the function call: length and width are non-negative numbers.
def func_1(length, width):
    return length * width
    #The program returns the area of a rectangle calculated as length multiplied by width, where both length and width are non-negative numbers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative numbers, `length` and `width`, and returns the area of a rectangle calculated as the product of `length` and `width`. The function does not handle negative inputs or any cases where either `length` or `width` is not a number, but as specified in the preconditions, both parameters are expected to be non-negative.
