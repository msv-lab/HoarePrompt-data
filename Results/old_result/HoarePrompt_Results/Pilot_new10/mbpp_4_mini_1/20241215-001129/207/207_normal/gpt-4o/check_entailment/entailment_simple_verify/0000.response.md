The original assessment states that the program's correctness is **False** due to the placement of the assertion statements before the definition of the function `func_1`. This results in a `NameError` when the assertions are executed, as the function is not defined at that point.

However, upon reviewing the annotated code, it appears the program is being assessed under the assumption that the input will be valid and that the program operates correctly once invoked with the function defined appropriately. The code annotations indicate that the function is correct in the context of calculating the area of a rectangle, given non-negative inputs.

The assertion statements are indeed placed before the function definition in the original code; however, it should be noted that in practice, the function should be defined first to avoid the `NameError`. If we consider the hypothetical situation where the assertions and function definition were appropriately ordered (with the function defined before assertions), the actual functionality of the `func_1` would be correct based on the problem description.

Thus, the original assessment fails to account for the function's correct behavior if the structure of the code were adjusted. Given the problem's description and the annotations confirming the function's correctness when called with valid inputs, it suggests that the overall goal (calculating the area) is indeed achieved satisfactorily.

Therefore, after evaluating the annotations, the structure of the code, and the original assessment:

Final: **False**
