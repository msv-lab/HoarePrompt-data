Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the function to calculate the area of a rectangle by multiplying the `length` and `width`. The output hints confirm that the function expects two non-negative numbers and returns their product, which is the correct area of the rectangle. The assertions provided also correctly verify the function's output for several valid cases. Although the hints mention that the function does not handle negative inputs or non-numeric types, the problem description specifies that the inputs are non-negative, making the implementation correct under the stated preconditions. Since the function meets the requirements for all expected inputs, it is deemed correct.
