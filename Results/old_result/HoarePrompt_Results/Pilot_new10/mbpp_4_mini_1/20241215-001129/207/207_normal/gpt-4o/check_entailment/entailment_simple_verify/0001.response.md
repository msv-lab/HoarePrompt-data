Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program defines the function `func_1`, which correctly computes the area of a rectangle by multiplying the length and width. The annotations confirm that the inputs to the function are assumed to be non-negative, which aligns with typical dimensions for a rectangle. The assert statements validate that the function behaves as expected for the provided test cases, returning the correct areas without errors. Given that all aspects of the problem description and the functionality of the program are satisfied, the overall correctness of the program stands confirmed.
