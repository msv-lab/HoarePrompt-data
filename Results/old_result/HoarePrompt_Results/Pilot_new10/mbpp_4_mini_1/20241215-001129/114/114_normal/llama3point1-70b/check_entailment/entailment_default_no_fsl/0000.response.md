Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and uses the `.count()` method of tuples to accurately count the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. 

According to the output hints, the method returns the correct count of occurrences, or 0 if the element is not present, and states that there are no edge cases or missing functionalities identified in the code. This aligns with the requirements of the problem description as well.

Since there are no identified edge cases or scenarios where the function fails, it works correctly for all potential cases as explained. Hence, the correctness of the program is confirmed as true.
