Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately reflects the correctness of the program based on the problem description and the provided annotations. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element and correctly utilizes the built-in `count` method to determine occurrences of the element within the tuple. The annotations confirm that the function handles various scenarios as described, including when the element is present multiple times, absent, or of different data types. Given that the function adheres to the requirements stated in the problem description and there are no identified edge cases or missing functionalities, the original assessment of correctness is validated.
