Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it meets the requirements:

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `elem` (an element of any data type).
2. Inside the function, it uses the method `count()` on the tuple `tup` to count the occurrences of `elem`. The `count()` method of tuple objects in Python returns the number of times a specified value appears in the tuple.
3. The program does not impose any restrictions on the data type of `elem`, which aligns with the problem description stating that `elem` can be of any data type.
4. It effectively fulfills the requirement of counting occurrences of the specified element within the given tuple.

Therefore, the function correctly handles the task outlined in the problem description for all valid inputs as described.
