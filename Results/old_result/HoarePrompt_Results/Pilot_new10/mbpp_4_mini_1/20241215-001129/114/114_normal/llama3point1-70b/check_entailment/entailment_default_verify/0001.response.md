Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1`, which employs the built-in `count` method for tuples, correctly counts the occurrences of the specified element within the tuple. Given the problem description, the function behaves as expected across various scenarios such as counting multiple occurrences, handling the case when the element is not present, and working with different data types. The output hints align with the assessment, confirming there are no edge cases or missing functionalities identified in the code. Hence, the function fulfills the requirements and should be considered correct.
