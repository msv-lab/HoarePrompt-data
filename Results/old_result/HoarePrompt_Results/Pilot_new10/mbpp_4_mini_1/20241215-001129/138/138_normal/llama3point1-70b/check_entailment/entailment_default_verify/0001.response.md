The program `func_1` fulfills the requirements stated in the problem description by correctly searching for an element in a list and returning a tuple that informs whether the element is present and its index, or -1 if it is not found. The `try`-`except` construct effectively handles the case where the element is not present in the list, thus returning the expected output.

However, the output hints you've provided mention that the function "does not handle cases where the array is empty." This is a critical point to consider. While it is stated that we assume valid input, the hints imply that the function may not behave as expected in that specific scenario. 

In the case where the input array is empty, the function would indeed raise a `ValueError` when calling `array.index(element)`, which contradicts the original assessment that asserts the program correctly handles all cases, including an empty array.

Hence, taking into account the original assessment's assertion that the program works correctly for all potential cases, and given the output hints which point out a missing handling for empty arrays, I conclude that the original assessment was inaccurate.

Final: **False**
