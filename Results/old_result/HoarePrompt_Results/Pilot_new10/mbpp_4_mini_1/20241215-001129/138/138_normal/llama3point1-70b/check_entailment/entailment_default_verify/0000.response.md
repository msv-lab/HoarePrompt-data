The original assessment claims that the program is correct and successfully implements the functionality described in the problem statement. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not explicitly handle cases where the array is empty, although it states that the logic remains consistent in the current implementation. 

Let's analyze this:

1. The function correctly returns `(False, -1)` when the array is empty, as attempting to find an index of any element in an empty array will result in a `ValueError`, which is caught and handled appropriately.
2. The handling of the given conditions (finding an element that may or may not be present in the array) is correctly implemented with the usage of the `list.index()` method and exception handling provided by the `try-except` block.
3. The output hints do acknowledge that the function does not explicitly handle empty arrays, but it implicitly handles this via existing logic since the behavior will still be correct.

Since the function conforms to the problem description and consistently handles the specified cases, including the empty array case effectively through exception handling, the original assessment appears to correctly reflect the function's correctness.

Final: **True**.
