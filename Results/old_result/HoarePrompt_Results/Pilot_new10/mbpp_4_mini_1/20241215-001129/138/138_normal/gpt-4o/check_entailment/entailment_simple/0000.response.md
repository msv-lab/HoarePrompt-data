Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the requirements laid out in the problem description. Specifically, the issue lies in the return statement of the function `func_1`. 

According to the problem description, the function should return a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). However, the function's return statement only handles returning the boolean and index when the element is found, but it treats the return value when the element is not found incorrectly.

While the program correctly returns `(True, index)` when the element is found, the return statement when the element is not found is `return False, -1`, which is correct and aligns with the requirement. However, the assertion statements alone assume the function handles various cases.

The correct interpretation of the problem implies that the tuple should always exist with the specified structure, and, theoretically the condition could be valid for all tested scenarios, but the logic for leading directly to `None` would cause an error if not handled.

In conclusion, the overall logic could lead to edge cases not being accommodated, and thus the program strictly can lead to interpretable errors based on any conditions mentioned. 

As such, the program is not wholly reliable, leading to the conclusion of correctness: **False**.
