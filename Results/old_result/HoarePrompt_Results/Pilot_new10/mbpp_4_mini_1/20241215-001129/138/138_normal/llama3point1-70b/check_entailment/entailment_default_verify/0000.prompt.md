You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in an array and element and returns a tuple containing a boolean that indicates if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).
Program:
```
def func_1(array, element):
    try:
        index = array.index(element)
        return (True, index)
    except ValueError:
        return (False, -1)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes an array and an element as inputs, and it uses the `index` method of the list to find the index of the given element. If the element is found, it returns a tuple containing `True` and the index. If the element is not found, it raises a `ValueError`, which is caught, and it returns a tuple containing `False` and `-1`. 

This approach handles all potential edge cases:
1. If the array is empty, the element will not be found, and the return value will be `(False, -1)`.
2. If the element is present in the array, it correctly provides `True` alongside the index of the first occurrence.
3. If the element is not present at all, it correctly provides `False` and `-1`.

Since the logic correctly handles all specified cases in the problem description, the function can be considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list `array` and an `element` of any type, and attempts to find the index of the element within the array. If the element is found, it returns True and the index of the element; if the element is not found, it returns False and -1. It does not handle cases where the array is empty, but the logic remains consistent in the current implementation. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
