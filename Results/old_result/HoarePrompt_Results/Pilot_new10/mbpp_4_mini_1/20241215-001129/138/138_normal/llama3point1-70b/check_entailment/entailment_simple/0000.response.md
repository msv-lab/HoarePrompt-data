Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes an array (a list of elements) and an element (which can be of any type) as inputs, aligning with the problem description that specifies these input types.

2. **Element Search**: The program uses the `index` method of the list to determine the position of the element. If the element is found, it effectively captures the index position.

3. **Return Value**: 
   - If the element is found in the array, the function returns a tuple `(True, index)`, where `True` indicates that the element exists in the array and `index` gives the position of the element. This matches the requirement in the problem description that states it should return a tuple with a boolean indicating presence and the index position of the element.
   - If the element is not found, a `ValueError` is raised, which is caught by the `except` block, leading to a return of `(False, -1)`. This conforms to the requirement that it should return `False` and `-1` when the element is not found.

4. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly manages edge cases, such as:
   - If the array is empty, it will correctly return `(False, -1)` since the element cannot be found.
   - It handles any data type for the element, as long as the array may contain such a type.

Overall, the program implements the functionality needed as described in the problem statement, ensuring accurate and expected behavior for all potential cases.
