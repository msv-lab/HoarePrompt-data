Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. The function is meant to return a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if not found). 

The program fails to address two key points:

1. **Return Structure**: In the code, the program returns `(True, index)` when the element is found, which is correct, but it returns `None` implicitly if the element is not found (which does not fit the expected return structure). Instead, it returns `(False, -1)` when the element is not found, which is correct. However, the explanation provided in the comments suggests that it returns `None`, which is misleading.

2. **Clarification on "Return None"**: The annotations imply that the function does return `None` when the element is not found, which contradicts the actual return statement that is supposed to yield `False, -1`. This discrepancy indicates potential confusion about the behavior of the function when the specified element is absent from the list.

In conclusion, since the code structure is sound but the commentary creates a misconception regarding the return values when the element is not found, it does not fully adhere to the problem description. Therefore, the overall correctness of the function does not align with the problemâ€™s requirements.
