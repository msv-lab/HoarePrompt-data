Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` does not accurately check if a string contains 'z' except at the start and end of each word. 

**Counterexample:** Consider the input string `"zebra is my favorite animal"`. The word "zebra" starts with 'z', so it should be skipped. However, the function checks the word "is" and finds no 'z', and then it checks "my", which also contains no 'z'. Finally, it checks "favorite" and "animal", both of which don't contain 'z' either, leading to a return value of `False`, despite "zebra" containing 'z', but at the start. 

Additionally, consider the input string `"a z b"` which should return `False` since the 'z' is the only letter in the word “z.” The function incorrectly would return `False`, while per the description, it seems we should also check if 'z' exists in the middle or between other characters, ignoring cases where 'z' exists only at the start or end. 

Thus, there are cases where the output of the function does not align with the problem description.
