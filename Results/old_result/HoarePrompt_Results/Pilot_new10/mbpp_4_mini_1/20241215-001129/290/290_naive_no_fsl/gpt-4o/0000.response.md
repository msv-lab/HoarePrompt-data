Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1(s)` incorrectly handles cases where the string has fewer than 3 characters. Specifically, if the string is "z" or "az" or "za", it will return `False`, but according to the problem description, it should return `False` as there are no characters between the start and end of the string to check. However, if the string is "z" by itself, we should still consider that to not have 'z' except at the start and end, but it doesn't handle these edge cases properly.

For example:
- For the input `func_1('z')` the function would throw an error (index out of range) when attempting to slice `s[1:-1]`, since `s` does not have sufficient length.

Thus, there exists at least one case (e.g., a single character string like "z") which the program does not handle correctly.
