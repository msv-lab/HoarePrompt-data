#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `words` is a list of words, `word` is the last word in the list. The loop will only return True if at least one `word` has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. If no such word is found, the return value is None. If `words` is empty, the loop does not execute and `word` is undefined.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that there are no words that are greater than 1 in length and contain the character 'z' in the specified substring. If there were any words present, the function would have executed a check, but since it returns False, it implies none of those conditions were met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s`, splits it into words, and checks if any of those words have a length greater than 1 and contain the character 'z' within their substring (excluding the first and last characters). It returns True if such a word is found, and False if no such word exists. An edge case includes an empty string input, which results in an immediate return of False, since there would be no words to check. The function does not handle cases where the input is not a string; such a scenario could lead to an AttributeError when attempting to call the split() method.
