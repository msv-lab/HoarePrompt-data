Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` with at least 1 character, and it checks for the presence of the character 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. If 'z' is found, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. If the string `s` has only one character, the substring check will automatically lead to a return of False since there are no characters between the first and last positions. **
