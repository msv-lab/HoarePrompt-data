According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `words` list. For the loop to execute again, it has to move to the next word in the list. At the end of the last iteration, `word` is the second word in the list `words`, which contains at least 2 words. 

To execute the loop one more time, the loop needs to proceed to the third word in the list. Therefore, if the list has at least 3 words, `word` will be updated to the third word.

State: **`s` is a string, `words` is a list containing at least 3 words, `word` is the third word in the list.**
