The code appears to be well-structured and attempts to follow the problem description. However, upon careful evaluation, we can identify certain flaws:

1. The first issue is an edge case regarding empty strings. The program correctly checks for the length of a word to be greater than 1 before looking for the character 'z'. When the input is an empty string, it will result in no words to process, and the function will correctly return False. However, this aspect is explicitly mentioned in the output hints as well.

2. A more significant problem arises with inputs that are not strings. The program lacks error handling for non-string inputs, which could lead to an AttributeError when the `split()` method is called. For instance, if we pass an integer or a list, the function will result in an exception instead of gracefully handling it.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem description for all potential cases, particularly because it does not handle the case where the input is not a string.

Correctness: **False**.
