The original assessment claimed that the function `func_1` is incorrect, stating that it does not properly check for the presence of 'z' in accordance with the problem description. Upon reviewing the implementation, it is evident that the function does check for 'z' within the words, while ensuring the first and last characters are not considered. 

The assessment pointed to a counterexample with the string `"zebra is my favorite animal"`, stating that `func_1` would return `False`, which is inaccurate. In this example, "zebra" contains 'z' at the start but would not cause the function to incorrectly return `True`, as the function would only return `True` if another word contained 'z' in the specified manner.

When considering the second counterexample `"a z b"`, the function also correctly identifies that 'z' appears at the edges of a single-character word and returns `False`, aligning with the problemâ€™s requirements.

The output hints further clarify that the function is designed to check words of length greater than 1 for an internal 'z'. It confirms that the function processes the input correctly according to the task's requirements.

Given these observations, it is clear the original assessment was too harsh. The function correctly fulfills the specified logic of the problem by identifying 'z' within the constraints defined in the description.

Final: **True**.
