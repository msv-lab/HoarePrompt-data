Correctness: **False**

The code does not correctly handle cases where the string `s` has only one character. According to the problem description, the function should check for the presence of 'z' in the string, except at the start and end of the word. However, if `s` has just one character (for example, 'z'), the function will return `False` since there are no characters to check between the first and last positions, but it should return `False` since 'z' is at the start (which is not allowed).

For example, `func_1('z')` should return `False`, which the current implementation does correctly. On the other hand, `func_1('a')` should also return `False`, which is correctly managed. Thus, the code handles the one-character case correctly, but there is no logic to handle strings with whitespace or characters only at the ends, such as `' az '`, which would lead to a `True` output, that shouldnâ€™t be the case as 'z' is between non-space characters.

Additionally, we know that the correct output when there are spaces or other characters together with `z` should return `False` if the character 'z' is found before the whitespace made by the start character or the end character in the sequence. The program lacks edge cases like detecting if `z` is at the beginning or the end properly worked out.

Thus, despite passing the initial assertions and basic edge cases, the program fails to handle certain potential cases correctly, and therefore is not correct according to the problem description overall.
