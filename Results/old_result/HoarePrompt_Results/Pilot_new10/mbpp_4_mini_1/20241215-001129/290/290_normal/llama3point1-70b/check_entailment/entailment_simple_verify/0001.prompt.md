You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program checks if any word in the input string contains the letter 'z' except at the start and end of the word. Here's why the program is correct:

1. It splits the input string into individual words.
2. It iterates through each word and checks:
   - If the word's length is greater than 1 (to ensure there are characters between the first and last ones), and
   - If the letter 'z' is present in the substring of the word that excludes the first and the last characters (i.e., `word[1:-1]`).
3. If both conditions are met, it returns `True`.
4. If no words satisfy the conditions, it returns `False`.

It correctly identifies the presence of 'z' in valid positions and handles edge cases like:
- Words of length 1 or 0 (which can't contain 'z' in between).
- Words that start or end with 'z'.

The program should work correctly for any input case based on the problem description provided. I couldn't find an example where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `words` is a list of words, `word` is the last word in the list. The loop will only return True if at least one `word` has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. If no such word is found, the return value is None. If `words` is empty, the loop does not execute and `word` is undefined.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that there are no words that are greater than 1 in length and contain the character 'z' in the specified substring. If there were any words present, the function would have executed a check, but since it returns False, it implies none of those conditions were met.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
