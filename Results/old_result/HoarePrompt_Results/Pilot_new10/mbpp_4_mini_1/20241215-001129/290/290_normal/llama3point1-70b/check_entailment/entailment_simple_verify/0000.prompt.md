You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that checks if a strings contains 'z', except at the start and end of the word.
Program:
```
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
    return False


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` does not accurately check if a string contains 'z' except at the start and end of each word. 

**Counterexample:** Consider the input string `"zebra is my favorite animal"`. The word "zebra" starts with 'z', so it should be skipped. However, the function checks the word "is" and finds no 'z', and then it checks "my", which also contains no 'z'. Finally, it checks "favorite" and "animal", both of which don't contain 'z' either, leading to a return value of `False`, despite "zebra" containing 'z', but at the start. 

Additionally, consider the input string `"a z b"` which should return `False` since the 'z' is the only letter in the word “z.” The function incorrectly would return `False`, while per the description, it seems we should also check if 'z' exists in the middle or between other characters, ignoring cases where 'z' exists only at the start or end. 

Thus, there are cases where the output of the function does not align with the problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    words = s.split()
    for word in words:
        if len(word) > 1 and 'z' in word[1:-1]:
            return True
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `words` is a list of words, `word` is the last word in the list. The loop will only return True if at least one `word` has a length greater than 1 and contains the character 'z' in the substring from the second character to the second-to-last character. If no such word is found, the return value is None. If `words` is empty, the loop does not execute and `word` is undefined.
    return False
    #The program returns False, indicating that there are no words that are greater than 1 in length and contain the character 'z' in the specified substring. If there were any words present, the function would have executed a check, but since it returns False, it implies none of those conditions were met.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
