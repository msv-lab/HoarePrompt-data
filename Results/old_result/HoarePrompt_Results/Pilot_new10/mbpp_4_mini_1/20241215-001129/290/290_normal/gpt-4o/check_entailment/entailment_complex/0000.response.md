Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description, which is to check if a string contains the character 'z', except at the start and end of the word.

Here's the breakdown of why the function is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` with a precondition that the string has at least one character. This aligns with the requirement of checking for the character 'z'.

2. **Substring Check**: The substring check `s[1:-1]` effectively isolates all characters in the string `s` except the first and last characters. This means that if `s` has only one character (as stated in the annotations), the substring check will result in an empty string, leading to a correct return value of `False`.

3. **Presence of 'z'**: The condition `if ('z' in s[1:-1])` checks for the presence of 'z' in the middle portion of the string. If 'z' is found, the function correctly returns `True`. If 'z' is not found in that portion, it returns `False`.

4. **Test Cases**:
   - `func_1('pythonzabc.')` returns `True` because 'z' is present in the substring.
   - `func_1('zxyabc.')` returns `False` because 'z' is at the start of the string, which is correctly accounted for.
   - `func_1('  lang  .')` returns `False` as there is no 'z' present in the substring when checking between the first and last characters.

Since all cases where 'z' should or should not be found are accounted for correctly by checking the substring `s[1:-1]`, we conclude that the implementation meets the problem's required behavior accurately. Therefore, the program is deemed correct based on the requirements.
