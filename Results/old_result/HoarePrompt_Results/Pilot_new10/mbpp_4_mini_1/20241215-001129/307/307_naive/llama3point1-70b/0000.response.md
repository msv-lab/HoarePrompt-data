Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. It calculates triangular numbers using the formula \( T_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \) and checks the number of digits using `len(str(triangular_num))`. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the code handles different cases:
1. If `n` is 1, it will find that the first triangular number (1) contains 1 digit, and thus will return an index of 1.
2. For `n` values greater than 1, the code will continue calculating triangular numbers until it finds one with enough digits.

No edge cases have been identified that could make the program fail to meet the requirement as stated in the problem description. Therefore, it is considered correct.
