Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the requirement to find the index of the smallest triangular number that has at least `n` digits. The method follows the logic as described in the problem statement, systematically checking each triangular number generated by the formula `idx * (idx + 1) // 2`. 

1. It initializes `idx` to 1 and enters an infinite loop that continues until the condition of finding a triangular number with `n` digits is met.
2. Inside the loop, it calculates the triangular number for the current `idx`.
3. The function then checks if the length of the string representation of this triangular number is greater than or equal to `n`.
4. Once it finds such a triangular number, it returns the current `idx`.

According to the output hints, the function meets all criteria set forth in the problem description, including not returning values like 1 or 2 when the condition of having enough digits is not satisfied. 

Through this systematic approach, the function guarantees that it will eventually find the correct index. Therefore, the program correctly handles all potential cases according to the given description.
