You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. However, the assertion tests provided (i.e., `func_1(2)`, `func_1(3)`, and `func_1(4)`) indicate specific expected outputs for `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`.

The correct outputs are:
- For `n = 2`, the first triangular number with 2 digits is 10 (the triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...), thus the correct index that should be returned is 4 (since \( T_4 = 10 \)).
- For `n = 3`, the first triangular number with 3 digits is 105 (where \( T_{14} = 105 \)), thus the correct index that should be returned is 14.
- For `n = 4`, the first triangular number with 4 digits is 136 (where \( T_{16} = 136 \)), thus the correct index that should be returned is 16.

However, the program is incorrectly set up because it doesn't actually check or return correct values based on the given `n`. 

If tested for `n = 2`, `func_1(2)` correctly returns 4, which is expected; however, for `n = 3`, it outputs 14 correctly too, but when checking for `n = 4`, it will output 16 instead of 45, which is what the assertion claims to expect.

Thus the first discrepancy:
- When `n = 4`, the program does not give the right triangular number index for a 4-digit number. 

Overall it fails to establish the expected behavior for the input given the real triangular numbers, leading to the conclusion that the code is incorrect and cannot satisfy the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the k-th triangular number has exactly `n` digits. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
