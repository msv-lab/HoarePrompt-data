Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly identifies the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits by calculating the triangular numbers using the formula \( T_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \) and checking the number of digits in each triangular number. The annotated version of the code supports this by confirming that `idx` will eventually reach the minimum integer for which the corresponding triangular number has at least `n` digits, and `triangular_num` represents the correct calculation of the triangular number. Given that the input is guaranteed to be a positive integer, the program will always function correctly and produce the desired result.
