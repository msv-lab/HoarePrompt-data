`k` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 1 to 2. The variables `n` and `triangular_number` remain unchanged. This also means that the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is still not equal to `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 2, `triangular_number` is 1, and the length of the string representation of `triangular_number` is not equal to `n`.**
