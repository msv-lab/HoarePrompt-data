The value of `idx` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `idx` is unknown, but since it is updated, we note that it has increased by 1. The other preconditions remain unchanged. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits, and `idx` has increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits, `idx` has increased by 1.**
