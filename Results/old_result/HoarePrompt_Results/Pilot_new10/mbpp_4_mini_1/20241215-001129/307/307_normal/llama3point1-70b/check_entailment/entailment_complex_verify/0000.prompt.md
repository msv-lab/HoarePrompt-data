You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    import math
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        idx += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly identifies the index of the smallest triangular number with at least `n` digits. It calculates triangular numbers using the formula \( T_n = \frac{n(n + 1)}{2} \) and checks the number of digits using `len(str(triangular_num))`. 

Here's a brief explanation of how the code handles different cases:
1. If `n` is 1, it will find that the first triangular number (1) contains 1 digit, and thus will return an index of 1.
2. For `n` values greater than 1, the code will continue calculating triangular numbers until it finds one with enough digits.

No edge cases have been identified that could make the program fail to meet the requirement as stated in the problem description. Therefore, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of digits.
def func_1(n):
    idx = 1
    while True:
        triangular_num = idx * (idx + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_num)) >= n:
            return idx
        
        idx += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `idx` is the minimum integer for which the triangular number is at least n digits, `triangular_num` is k * (k + 1) // 2, n is a positive integer representing the number of digits.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `idx` such that the triangular number corresponding to `idx` has at least `n` digits. The function continues to increment `idx` until it finds a triangular number whose string representation has a length greater than or equal to `n`. There are no cases where it returns 1 or 2; it only returns the value of `idx` once the condition is met.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
