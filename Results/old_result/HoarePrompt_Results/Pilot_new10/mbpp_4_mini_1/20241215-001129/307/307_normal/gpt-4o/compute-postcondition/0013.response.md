The value of `triangular_number` is reassigned to `k * (k + 1) // 2`. Given that `k` is 3, we calculate `triangular_number` as follows: 

```
triangular_number = 3 * (3 + 1) // 2
triangular_number = 3 * 4 // 2
triangular_number = 12 // 2
triangular_number = 6
```

Now, `triangular_number` has been updated to 6. The variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 3, and `triangular_number` is now 6.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number, `k` is 3, `triangular_number` is 6**
