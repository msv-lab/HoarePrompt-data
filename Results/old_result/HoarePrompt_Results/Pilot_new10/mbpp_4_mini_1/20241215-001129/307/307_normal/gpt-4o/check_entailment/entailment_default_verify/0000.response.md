The original assessment states that the program correctly finds the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits, and it appears to provide correct outputs for the given cases where `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`.

However, considering the output hints which specify that the function should return the smallest integer `k` such that the k-th triangular number has exactly `n` digits, we can infer that the current program works correctly for the provided test cases. Triangular numbers are indeed generated properly, and their digit counts are being checked as intended.

The logic to find the smallest triangular number with `n` digits is sound and efficiently implemented. Additionally, the program correctly handles the typical input cases as stated in the original assessment. The assumption that input will be valid (i.e., a positive integer for `n`) aligns with the output hints assertively confirming what the function is supposed to do.

Since the program meets the conditions specified in the problem description and has been verified against multiple test cases that account for typical scenarios, the original assessment of **True** is maintained.

Final: **True**
