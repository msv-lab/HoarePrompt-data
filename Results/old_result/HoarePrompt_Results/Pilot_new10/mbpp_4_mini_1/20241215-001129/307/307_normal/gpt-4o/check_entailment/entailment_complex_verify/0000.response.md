Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the logic to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits by iterating through the values of `k`, calculating triangular numbers, and checking their digit count. The assertions confirm that the function produces the expected results for `n=2`, `n=3`, and `n=4`. 

The annotated version of the code provides clarity on the state of variables and the function's purpose, ensuring that `k` will indeed reflect the smallest index corresponding to a triangular number with exactly `n` digits. The looping structure and logical checks are sound and align with the problem description. Therefore, the assessment of correctness as **True** holds.
