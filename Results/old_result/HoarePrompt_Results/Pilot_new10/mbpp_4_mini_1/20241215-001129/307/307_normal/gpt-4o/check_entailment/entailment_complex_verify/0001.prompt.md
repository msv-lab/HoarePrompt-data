You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the index of smallest triangular number with n digits.
Program:
```
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        k += 1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is designed to find the index of the smallest triangular number with `n` digits. However, the assertion tests provided (i.e., `func_1(2)`, `func_1(3)`, and `func_1(4)`) indicate specific expected outputs for `n = 2`, `n = 3`, and `n = 4`.

The correct outputs are:
- For `n = 2`, the first triangular number with 2 digits is 10 (the triangular numbers are 1, 3, 6, 10, 15, ...), thus the correct index that should be returned is 4 (since \( T_4 = 10 \)).
- For `n = 3`, the first triangular number with 3 digits is 105 (where \( T_{14} = 105 \)), thus the correct index that should be returned is 14.
- For `n = 4`, the first triangular number with 4 digits is 136 (where \( T_{16} = 136 \)), thus the correct index that should be returned is 16.

However, the program is incorrectly set up because it doesn't actually check or return correct values based on the given `n`. 

If tested for `n = 2`, `func_1(2)` correctly returns 4, which is expected; however, for `n = 3`, it outputs 14 correctly too, but when checking for `n = 4`, it will output 16 instead of 45, which is what the assertion claims to expect.

Thus the first discrepancy:
- When `n = 4`, the program does not give the right triangular number index for a 4-digit number. 

Overall it fails to establish the expected behavior for the input given the real triangular numbers, leading to the conclusion that the code is incorrect and cannot satisfy the problem description for every potential case.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(2) == 4
assert func_1(3) == 14
assert func_1(4) == 45

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the number of digits in the triangular number.
def func_1(n):
    k = 1
    while True:
        triangular_number = k * (k + 1) // 2
        
        if len(str(triangular_number)) == n:
            return k
        
        k += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `k` is the first integer after all iterations where the triangular number has `n` digits, `n` stays as the original positive integer for number of digits; the triangular number is equal to the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`, leading to a triangular number with exactly `n` digits.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` and returns the smallest integer `k` such that the k-th triangular number has exactly `n` digits.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
