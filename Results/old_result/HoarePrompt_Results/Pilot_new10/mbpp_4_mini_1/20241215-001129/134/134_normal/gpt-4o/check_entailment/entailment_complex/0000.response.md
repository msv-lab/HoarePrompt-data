The provided program is intended to calculate the sum of even index binomial coefficients for a given positive integer \( n \). However, the implementation of `func_1` simply returns \( 2^{(n - 1)} \), which does not correspond to the task of summing the even index binomial coefficients.

The correct method of calculating the sum of even index binomial coefficients \( C(n, 0) + C(n, 2) + C(n, 4) + \ldots \) would involve the use of the binomial theorem, and the result is expressed as \( 2^{(n-1)} \) only in specific contexts, such as when \( n \) is treated in ways that do not strictly correspond to the definition of "even index".

The assertions given in the annotated program do not validate the main task, which is to compute the sum of the even index binomial coefficients. 

To explicitly show this with an example, for \( n = 4 \):
- The even index binomial coefficients for \( n = 4 \) are \( C(4, 0) = 1 \), \( C(4, 2) = 6 \), and \( C(4, 4) = 1 \).
- Thus, their sum is \( 1 + 6 + 1 = 8 \), which agrees with the assertion `assert func_1(4) == 8`, but does not mean that the implemented logic is correct for all cases, particularly it does not address the varying behavior of summing these coefficients under different \( n \).

Since the function does not implement the sum of even index binomial coefficients (which can vary and cannot be assumed simply as \( 2^{(n - 1)} \) systematically for all values of \( n \)), the implementation does not meet the problem description accurately.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**
