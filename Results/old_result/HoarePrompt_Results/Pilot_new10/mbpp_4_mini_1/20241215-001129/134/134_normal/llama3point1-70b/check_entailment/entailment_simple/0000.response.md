Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. It defines a function `func_1(n)` that takes a positive integer `n` and computes the sum of binomial coefficients at even indices from `0` to `n`. 

Here's why the implementation is correct:

1. **Iteration over Indices**: The program uses a `for` loop to iterate through all integers `i` from `0` to `n` (inclusive).

2. **Even Index Check**: Inside the loop, it checks if `i` is even using `if i % 2 == 0`. This condition ensures that only even indices are considered.

3. **Sum of Binomial Coefficients**: The function correctly computes the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` for each even index `i` and accumulates this value in the variable `sum`.

4. **Final Result**: After the loop, it returns the total sum of the binomial coefficients corresponding to even indices, which is exactly what the problem description requires.

Thus, the program behaves as expected for any positive integer `n`, fulfilling the task of finding the sum of even-index binomial coefficients.
