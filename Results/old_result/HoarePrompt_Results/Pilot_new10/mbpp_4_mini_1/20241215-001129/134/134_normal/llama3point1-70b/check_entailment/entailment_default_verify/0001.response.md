Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the logic specified in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` iterates through the range of indices from 0 to `n`, checking for even indices, and correctly sums the corresponding binomial coefficients using `math.comb(n, i)`. The output hints further clarify that the function behaves as intended, confirming that there are no issues with the implementation. Given the valid assumption of positive integer input and the absence of any identified edge cases that could affect correctness, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
