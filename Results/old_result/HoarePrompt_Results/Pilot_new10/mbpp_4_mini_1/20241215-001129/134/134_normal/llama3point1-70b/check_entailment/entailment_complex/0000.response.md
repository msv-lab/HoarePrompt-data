Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the solution as per the problem description. Here's the breakdown of its correctness:

1. **Input**: The function `func_1(n)` takes a positive integer `n` as input, which aligns with the requirement that the input must be a positive integer.

2. **Logic**: The program iterates over all integers `i` from `0` to `n` and checks if `i` is even (i.e., `i % 2 == 0`). This condition ensures that the program only sums the binomial coefficients `math.comb(n, i)` for even indices. 

3. **Computation**: For every even index `i`, the binomial coefficient `math.comb(n, i)` is correctly calculated and added to the `sum` variable. This is precisely what is required to find the sum of even index binomial coefficients.

4. **Output**: After completing the loop, the program correctly returns the computed sum.

The code annotation confirms the correctness by stating that the `sum` variable holds the sum of the binomial coefficients for even indices `i` from `0` to `n`.

Overall, the logic, implementation, and output all align perfectly with the requirements laid out in the problem description, ensuring the program is indeed correct.
