Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The annotated version of the program confirms that the function `func_1(n)` correctly handles the input of a positive integer `n` and computes the sum of the binomial coefficients at even indices from 0 to `n`. 

1. The annotation before the execution of the function clearly states that `n` is a positive integer.
2. After the loop executes, the annotation indicates that `sum` contains the correct cumulative result of `math.comb(n, i)` for all even indices `i` from 0 to `n`, affirming that the logic to sum only the even indices is correctly implemented.
3. The program returns this sum, which satisfies the requirements of the problem statement.

Therefore, based on the provided program, its logic, the annotations confirming its behavior, and the initial assessment, the final determination is that the program is correct.
