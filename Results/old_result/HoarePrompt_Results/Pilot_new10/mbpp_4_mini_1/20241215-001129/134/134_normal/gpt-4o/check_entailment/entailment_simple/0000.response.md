Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the problem description requirements. The problem description asks for a function that calculates the sum of the even index binomial coefficients for a positive integer \( n \). However, the function `func_1(n)` simply returns \( 2^{(n-1)} \), which does not involve any calculations related to binomial coefficients or their indices.

For instance, when \( n = 4 \), the binomial coefficients corresponding to \( n = 4 \) are \( C(4,0), C(4,1), C(4,2), C(4,3), \) and \( C(4,4) \), which evaluates to \( 1, 4, 6, 4, 1 \). The even-indexed coefficients are \( C(4,0) \) and \( C(4,2) \), which sum to \( 1 + 6 = 7 \), not \( 8 \) as indicated in the assertion.

Thus, the function does not fulfill the requirements of calculating the sum of the even index binomial coefficients, which is why it is incorrect.
