Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` attempts to split the input list into sublists based on every nth element. However, the implementation has a logical flaw when handling lists that are not perfectly divisible by n, particularly with cases where the total number of elements in `lst` is less than n or where n is zero or negative. 

For example, consider the case:
```python
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c'], 5)
```
This should ideally produce `result` as `[[], [], [], [], []]`, but instead, it will return `[[], [], [], [], ['a'], ['b'], ['c']]`, leading to incorrect distribution.

Additionally, if `n` is less than or equal to 0, the code would raise a `Division by zero` error or create an invalid structure for the lists. 

Since there are examples where the code does not behave as expected per the problem description, the correctness of the program is false.
