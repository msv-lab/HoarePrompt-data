Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where `n` exceeds the length of the list `lst`. According to the problem description, the functionality should return a list of sublists splitting `lst` for every nth element. However, if `n` is greater than the number of elements in `lst`, the program still generates sublists starting from all indices from `0` to `n-1`, which leads to empty sublists in situations where `n` is too high. 

For example, consider an input case:
```python
lst = [1, 2]
n = 5
```
The expected behavior would be that the function returns two empty sublists because there are not enough elements to generate a full set of sublists of size `n`. However, the actual output from the program will be `[1, 2], [], [], [], []`, which does not correctly reflect the logic intended by the problem description as there are more empty sublists than necessary for `n` being greater than the size of `lst`.

Thus, the implementation fails when `n` exceeds the length of the list.
