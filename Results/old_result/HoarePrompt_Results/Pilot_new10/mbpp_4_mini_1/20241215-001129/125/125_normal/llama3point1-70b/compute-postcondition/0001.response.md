The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `n`. `lst` is a list of elements, and `n` is a positive integer such that `n` is less than or equal to the length of `lst`. The function returns a list of sublists created by splitting `lst` into `n` parts, where each sublist contains every nth element starting from index `i` for each `i` in the range of `n`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and return a list of `n` sublists, each containing every nth element from the original list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a positive integer n. It returns a list of sublists created by splitting lst into n parts, where each sublist contains every nth element starting from indices 0 to n-1.**
