Final: **True**

The annotated code states that before the function call, `lst` is assured to be a list of elements and `n` is a positive integer such that `n <= len(lst)`. This guarantees that the function will only be called with valid input that conforms to the requirements. As such, there are no edge cases involving `n` being greater than `len(lst)` or being zero, which were pointed out in the original assessment. Given these assumptions about the inputs, the program correctly returns the expected output for valid scenarios defined by the problem description. Thus, the original assessment was overly cautious considering the defined input constraints, and the program is indeed correct under the provided assumptions.
