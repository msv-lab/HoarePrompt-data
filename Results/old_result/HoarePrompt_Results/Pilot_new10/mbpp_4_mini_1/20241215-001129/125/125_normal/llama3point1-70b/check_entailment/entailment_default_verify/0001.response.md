The original assessment correctly identifies the issues present in the program regarding edge cases. Specifically, the assessment points out that the function does not handle the case where `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, resulting in empty sublists. It also mentions that a `ZeroDivisionError` occurs if `n` is zero, which is an important point when evaluating correctness.

The output hints further clarify the functionality of the program, stating that if `n` exceeds the number of elements in `lst`, the function will return empty sublists, which does not align with the intuitive expectation of splitting a list into meaningful parts. 

Given that the original assessment captured the key points of concern about the function's behavior and the handling of edge cases—especially in relation to the problem description—the reasons provided align with the output hints. 

Thus, I maintain that the original assessment is accurate.

Final: **False**
