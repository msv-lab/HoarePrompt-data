The variable `result` is assigned a list containing `n` empty lists, which means that `result` will now be a list of lists with exactly `n` elements. The variable `lst` is unaffected by this operation, and its content is still a list of elements. The value of `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0, which determines the number of empty lists in `result`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of elements, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `result` is a list containing `n` empty lists.**
