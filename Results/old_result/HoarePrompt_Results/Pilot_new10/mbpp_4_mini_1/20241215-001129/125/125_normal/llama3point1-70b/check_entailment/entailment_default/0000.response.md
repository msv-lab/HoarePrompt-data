Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided code is incorrect as it does not handle the case where `n` is equal to 0 properly. Although the problem description mentions a positive integer `n`, it does not handle inputs where `n` is greater than the length of `lst`, leading to sublists that might be empty. According to the output hints, if `n` exceeds the number of elements in `lst`, the function will still return sublistsâ€”this means that for small lists with a large `n`, we can end up with many empty lists. Additionally, if `n` is less than or equal to 0 (not specified but theoretically possible), the function should ideally raise an exception or handle such cases gracefully. 

For example, calling `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)` would return `[[], [], [], [], []]`, which is not inherently incorrect but does not align with the expected behavior of splitting properly with the given constraints. Hence, the code does not truly follow the problem description for every potential case.
