The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of sublists created by splitting `lst` into `n` parts. Each sublist contains elements from `lst` at every nth index starting from indices 0 to n-1. Therefore, if `n` exceeds the number of elements in `lst`, the function will still return sublists according to the logic defined, which could lead to some empty sublists if `lst` has fewer elements than `n`.
