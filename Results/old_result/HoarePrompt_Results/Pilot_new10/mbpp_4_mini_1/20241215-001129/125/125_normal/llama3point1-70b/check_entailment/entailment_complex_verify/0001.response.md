The original assessment stated that the function does not handle cases where `n` is greater than the length of the list and that it raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if `n` is zero, both of which were highlighted as failures in correctness.

The annotation clarifies that we assume the input parameters are valid, specifically stating that `n` is a positive integer such that `n <= len(lst)`. Therefore, under these conditions, the function will behave correctly as designed. For valid inputs where `n` is indeed less than or equal to the length of `lst`, the function splits the list correctly and returns the expected result of sublists based on the described logic.

The original assessment incorrectly identified the handling of invalid inputs (such as `n` being greater than the length of `lst` or equal to zero) as an issue of correctness in this context, although the annotated version assumes such inputs won't occur.

Considering all this, I find that the original assessment was not accurate given the assumptions provided in the annotations regarding input validity.

Final: **True**
