Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description. According to the problem, the function should split a list into sublists for every nth element, which means it should return sublists of the original list where each sublist contains every nth element starting from a specific index defined by 'i'. 

However, the implementation of the program as given has the following issues:

1. **Logic Flaw in Indexing**: The program uses list slicing with `lst[i::n]`, which results in each sublist starting with every nth element from index `i`. This means that if `n` is greater than the number of elements in `lst`, the sublists will be incorrectly populated by empty lists for indices greater than the length of `lst`, contrary to what is stated in the updated annotations. It does not handle the list splitting in the way outlined by the problem.

2. **Incorrect Split Handling**: The problem description does not specify any behavior for when `n` exceeds the size of the list, while the programâ€™s behavior in such cases leads to unnecessary creation of empty lists. Specifically, it should return complete parts based on a critical segmentation of the list that takes into account both `n` and `len(lst)` effectively.

To resolve this, the program function should:
- Create sublists where each sublist contains the right elements based on the interpretation of splitting the list at every nth index without ending up leading to empty lists if `n` is larger than the list size.

Because of these discrepancies, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases and is therefore deemed incorrect.
