You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function that takes in a list and an integer n and splits a list for every nth element, returning a list of the resulting lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', 'g', 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n'], 3) == [['a', 'd', 'g', 'j', 'm'], ['b', 'e', 'h', 'k', 'n'], ['c', 'f', 'i', 'l']]
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10, 11, 12, 13, 14], 3) == [[1, 4, 7, 10, 13], [2, 5, 8, 11, 14], [3, 6, 9, 12]]
assert func_1(['python', 'java', 'C', 'C++', 'DBMS', 'SQL'], 2) == [['python', 'C', 'DBMS'], ['java', 'C++', 'SQL']]

def func_1(lst, n):
    result = [[] for _ in range(n)]
    for (i, element) in enumerate(lst):
        result[i % n].append(element)
    return result


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The provided function `func_1` attempts to split the input list into sublists based on every nth element. However, the implementation has a logical flaw when handling lists that are not perfectly divisible by n, particularly with cases where the total number of elements in `lst` is less than n or where n is zero or negative. 

For example, consider the case:
```python
assert func_1(['a', 'b', 'c'], 5)
```
This should ideally produce `result` as `[[], [], [], [], []]`, but instead, it will return `[[], [], [], [], ['a'], ['b'], ['c']]`, leading to incorrect distribution.

Additionally, if `n` is less than or equal to 0, the code would raise a `Division by zero` error or create an invalid structure for the lists. 

Since there are examples where the code does not behave as expected per the problem description, the correctness of the program is false.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and it returns a list containing `n` sublists that evenly distribute the elements from `lst` based on their order using modulo `n`. Each sublist corresponds to indices from `lst` that yield the same remainder when divided by `n`. This distribution results in potentially uneven sublists if `len(lst)` is not a multiple of `n`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
