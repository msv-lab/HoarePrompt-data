The original assessment of the program's correctness is based on the idea that the function does not handle cases where the input list's length is less than `n` correctly, and that it fails to address potential division by zero errors or handling of negative input for `n`.

However, upon reviewing the problem description, the program specification, and the provided annotations, I see that the assumptions state that valid inputs will always be provided. Therefore, it is not necessary for `func_1` to check for inputs that might cause errors like negative values for `n` or an empty list. 

The assessments made in the original evaluation—specifically about how lists are distributed—seem to misinterpret the intent of the function when valid inputs are used. The function correctly splits the list into `n` sublists according to the specified logic, and even if the lengths of these sublists are uneven (when `len(lst)` is not a multiple of `n`), this does not inherently make the program incorrect based on the problem description that simply requests a split for every nth element.

Thus, given the annotations affirming that the implementation functions as described by distributing elements into `n` separate sublists as intended, the original assessment appears to not account for the validity of the assumptions stipulated regarding the input.

Final: **True**
