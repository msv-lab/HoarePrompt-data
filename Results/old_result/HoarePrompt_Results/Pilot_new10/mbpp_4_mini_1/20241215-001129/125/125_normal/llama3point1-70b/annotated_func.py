#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of elements, and n is a positive integer such that n <= len(lst).
def func_1(lst, n):
    return [lst[i::n] for i in range(n)]
    #The program returns a list of sublists created by splitting 'lst' into 'n' parts, where each sublist contains every nth element starting from index i for i in the range of n.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list `lst` and a positive integer `n`, and returns a list of sublists created by splitting `lst` into `n` parts. Each sublist contains elements from `lst` at every nth index starting from indices 0 to n-1. Therefore, if `n` exceeds the number of elements in `lst`, the function will still return sublists according to the logic defined, which could lead to some empty sublists if `lst` has fewer elements than `n`.
