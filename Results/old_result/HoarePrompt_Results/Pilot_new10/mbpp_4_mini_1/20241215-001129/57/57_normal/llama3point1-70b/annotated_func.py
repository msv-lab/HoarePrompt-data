#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains strings.
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist, key=str.lower) for sublist in list_of_lists]
    #The program returns a list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains strings. It returns a new list of lists where each sublist is sorted in a case-insensitive manner. There are no checks for empty sublists or handling of non-string elements, so it assumes all elements can be compared and sorted correctly.
