The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list consisting of sublists, where each sublist contains strings. After executing the function body, it returns a new list of lists, where each sublist contains the strings from the original `list_of_lists` sorted in ascending order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists containing strings and return a new list of lists with each sublist sorted in ascending order.
