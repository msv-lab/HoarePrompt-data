The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because the expected outputs in the assertions do not match the actual sorted outputs produced by the function. However, upon reviewing the annotations and the function itself, it is clear that the `sorted()` function operates as intended for sorting each sublist of strings in ascending order.

The original assessment highlights that the expected output for the input `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])` should be `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`. However, this expected output for the last sublist is incorrect. The correct sorted version would be `['black', 'orange', 'white']`. It appears that the assertions provided in the original program contain errors regarding what the actual expected outputs should be for the given inputs. 

As such, the program `func_1()` is functioning correctly according to the problem description, which is to sort each sublist of strings.

Given this analysis, the original assessment was inaccurate.

Final: **True**.
