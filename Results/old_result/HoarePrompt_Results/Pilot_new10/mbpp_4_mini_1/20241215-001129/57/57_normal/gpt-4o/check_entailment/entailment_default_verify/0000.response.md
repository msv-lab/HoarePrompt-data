The original assessment stated that the function `func_1` was incorrect. However, upon reviewing the function and the corresponding output hints, it becomes clear that the expected outputs in the assertions are indeed incorrect. 

In the first assertion, the expected output for `(['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])` should correctly be `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]` (as indicated in the original assessment), which is indeed the sorted combination and matches what the code produces.

The second assertion expected `[[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]`, which is also incorrect since sorting the second sublist `[' blue', ' black']` should yield `[' black', 'blue ']`.

Lastly, in the third assertion, the expected output should be `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`, which matches what the code produces.

Given that the function correctly sorts each sublist and the discrepancies lie in the expected output from the assertions, the function aligns with the problem description.

Considering these points leads me to conclude that the original assessment was inaccurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the desired sorting functionality for the defined input and does not itself have issues based on the information provided.

Final: **True**
