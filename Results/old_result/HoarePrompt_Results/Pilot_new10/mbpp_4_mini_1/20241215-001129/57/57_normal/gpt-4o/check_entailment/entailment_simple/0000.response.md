The provided program is as follows:

```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]
```

### Problem Analysis
The problem description requires a function that sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists. 

### Function Explanation
1. The function `func_1` takes a single argument, `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists.
2. It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each `sublist` in `list_of_lists`.
3. For each `sublist`, it calls the `sorted()` function, which returns a new list of the elements sorted in ascending order.
4. Finally, the function returns a list containing the sorted sublists.

### Verification Against Problem Description
The program correctly handles the following requirements of the problem description:
- It sorts each individual sublist.
- The result is a new list of lists containing the sorted sublists.

### Test Cases Validation
The assertions provided are used to ensure that the function produces the expected outputs:

1. `assert func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange']))` should yield `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`. However, `'black'` comes before `'white'`, so the expected result should actually be `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`, which matches the assertion.

2. The second assertion also shows the function should handle extra spaces correctly, which it does with the given input.

3. The third assertion correctly expects `[['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]`, and this is verified against normal sorting rules.

### Conclusion
The function correctly sorts each sublist as required. It adheres to the problem description without any issues.

Correctness: **True**
