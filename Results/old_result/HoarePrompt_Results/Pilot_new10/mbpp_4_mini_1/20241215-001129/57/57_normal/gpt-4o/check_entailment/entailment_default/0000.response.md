The Python function `func_1` is supposed to sort each sublist of strings within a given list of lists. The implementation uses a list comprehension to apply the built-in `sorted()` function to each sublist.

Let's analyze the provided assertions:
1. The first assertion seems to check sorting a valid list of strings with expected outputs.
2. The second assertion has leading or trailing spaces in the strings, which could affect the sorting order. The expected output indicates that these spaces are preserved in the strings.
3. The third assertion checks a list of strings that are all lowercase and sorts them correctly.

Next, let's consider the output hints, which indicate that the function does not handle cases where the input is not a list or contains non-string elements. This oversight will lead to runtime errors in those cases.

The program correctly sorts the strings in the provided example cases. However, it fails to cover the scenario where the input might not be a list of lists or contains non-string elements, which means the function is not robust against all potential input cases. 

Thus, the function doesn't adhere to the problem description for every potential case due to this limitation.

Correctness: **False**.
