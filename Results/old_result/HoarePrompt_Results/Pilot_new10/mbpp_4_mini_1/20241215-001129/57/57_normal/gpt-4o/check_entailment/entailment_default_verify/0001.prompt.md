You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to sort each sublist of strings in a given list of lists.
Program:
```
assert func_1((['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['white', 'black', 'orange'])) == [['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]
assert func_1(([' red ', 'green'], ['blue ', ' black'], [' orange', 'brown'])) == [[' red ', 'green'], [' black', 'blue '], [' orange', 'brown']]
assert func_1((['zilver', 'gold'], ['magnesium', 'aluminium'], ['steel', 'bronze'])) == [['gold', 'zilver'], ['aluminium', 'magnesium'], ['bronze', 'steel']]

def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [sorted(sublist) for sublist in list_of_lists]


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided function, we need to evaluate if it indeed sorts each sublist of strings in the given list of lists. 

The function `func_1` operates by using a list comprehension that iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and applies the built-in `sorted()` function to each one. The `sorted()` function sorts the strings in each sublist in ascending order based on their lexicographic order, which is the correct behavior for sorting strings.

Now, we should consider the test cases and if they cover all potential edge cases.

1. The first assertion checks the sorting of the sublists `['green', 'orange']` and `['black', 'white']`, which sorts correctly to `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]`. However, the sorted output seems incorrect as it suggests it would sort the list of strings as `[['green', 'orange'], ['black', 'white'], ['black', 'orange', 'white']]` could imply an error when comparing sorted outputs.

2. The second assertion checks for leading/trailing spaces and shows the function retains those strings intact while sorting but does not remove spaces, which may lead to confusion over whether the function should also strip whitespace.

3. The third assertion sorts the sublists correctly to get lexicographically sorted results.

However, to illustrate a potential case where the program may not work as intended or as described:

- If empty sublists are provided, such as in `func_1([[], ['abc', 'def']])`, the output would be `[[], ['abc', 'def']]`, which is expected but might not be covered in the examples.

- Additionally, the issue of handling strings with leading or trailing spaces can lead to unexpected results. For instance, in the second test case, the spaces are preserved:
  ```python
  assert func_1([['  A', 'b'], [' C', 'a']]) == [['  A', 'b'], [' C', 'a']]  # This will not sort correctly based on how one would expect it to be sorted.
  ```

Given these considerations and that the provided assertions do not cover every possible edge case (like whitespace handling and empty sublists), I find that the code does not fulfill the problem description comprehensively.

Thus, I conclude:
Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of lists where each sublist contains strings, and returns a new list of lists with each sublist sorted in ascending order. It does not handle cases where the input is not a list or contains non-string elements, which could lead to runtime errors if those inputs are provided. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
