Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly sorts each sublist of strings in a given list of lists using a case-insensitive approach through the `sorted()` function with `key=str.lower`. The annotated version confirms this by stating that the program processes a list of lists and returns a properly sorted result, handling various cases such as mixed-case strings, empty sublists, and single-string sublists effectively. The examples provided in the original assessment further validate that the implementation correctly meets the requirements described in the problem statement.
