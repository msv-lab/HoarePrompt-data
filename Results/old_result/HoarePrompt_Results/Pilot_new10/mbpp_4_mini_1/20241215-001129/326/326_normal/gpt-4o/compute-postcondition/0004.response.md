The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of positive infinity, which does not affect any other variables. The values of `arr` and `n` remain unchanged after this execution.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `min_diff` is float('inf')**
