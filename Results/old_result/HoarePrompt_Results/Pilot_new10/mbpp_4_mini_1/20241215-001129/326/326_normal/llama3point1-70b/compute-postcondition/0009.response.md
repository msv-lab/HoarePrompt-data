The value of `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`. Since `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, the value of `min_diff` now reflects that absolute difference. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state includes the updated value of `min_diff` based on the calculation of the absolute difference between the second and third elements of the sorted list `arr`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])`, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[1] - arr[2])**
