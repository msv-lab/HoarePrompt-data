The value of `diff` is updated to be the difference between `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`, where `i` is currently 2. Thus, `diff` will now be equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`. The other variables' states remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]**
