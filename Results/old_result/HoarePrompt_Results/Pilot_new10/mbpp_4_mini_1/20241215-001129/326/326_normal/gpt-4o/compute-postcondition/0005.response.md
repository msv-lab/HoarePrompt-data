According to the code, for the loop to execute, the value of `n` must be at least 2, since the range for `i` is from 0 to `n - 2`. Given that `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr` and is greater than or equal to 2, the loop will execute.

At the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0, which is the first value in the range. The variables needed for the loop to function correctly, namely `arr` and `min_diff`, are already defined; thus, the primary states that need to be established before the loop executes are the current values for `i`, `arr`, and that `n` is indeed greater than or equal to 2.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr` that is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `min_diff` is float('inf')**
