The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `target`. `arr` is a list of integers, and `target` is an integer. After executing the function body, the function returns the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list `arr`, denoted as `min_diff`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and return the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted version of `arr`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, and returns the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list `arr`.**
