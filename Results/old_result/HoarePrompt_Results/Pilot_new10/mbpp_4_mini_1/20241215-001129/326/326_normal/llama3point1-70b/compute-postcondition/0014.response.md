Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers with at least 3 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is unchanged, `i` is 2, and `diff` is equal to `abs(arr[2] - arr[3])`. If `diff` is less than `min_diff`, then the function will recognize that the difference is minimal, otherwise, `min_diff` remains unchanged.***
