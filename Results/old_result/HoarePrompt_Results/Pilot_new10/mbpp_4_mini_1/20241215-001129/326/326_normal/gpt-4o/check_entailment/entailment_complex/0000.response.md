Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` does not correctly implement the requirement stated in the problem description. The problem specifies that the function should find the minimum difference between any two elements in a given array. However, the implementation only considers the difference between consecutive elements in the sorted version of the array.

### Reasons for Incorrectness:

1. **Only Consecutive Differences**: The algorithm sorts the array and calculates differences only between consecutive elements. However, the minimum difference can occur between non-consecutive elements as well. For example, in the array `(1, 4, 5, 10)`, the differences between all pairs are:
   - (1, 4): 3
   - (1, 5): 4
   - (1, 10): 9
   - (4, 5): 1
   - (4, 10): 6
   - (5, 10): 5
   The minimum difference is clearly `1` (between 4 and 5), which is accounted for, but if there are elements further apart that are closer to each other, the current implementation will miss them.

2. **Example Cases**:
   - The input `(1, 5, 3, 19, 18, 25)` will correctly return `1`, as the minimum difference is between `18` and `19`.
   - However, consider the example input `(1, 7, 3, 19, 18, 25)`. The minimum difference is between `1` and `3`, which is `2`. But since the function sorts and only checks consecutive pairs in the sorted list, it would also catch `18` and `19` yielding `1` as the result â€” hence breaking the logic as it's not the true minimum overall.

The correct approach would require checking all pairwise differences within the array instead of just consecutive ones after sorting, leading to the conclusion that the program fails to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.

Thus, the implementation does not fulfill the requirement to find the minimum difference between any two elements in the array.

In conclusion, the function has a logical flaw in how it computes the minimum difference, which directly leads to its failure to satisfy the problem's requirements.
