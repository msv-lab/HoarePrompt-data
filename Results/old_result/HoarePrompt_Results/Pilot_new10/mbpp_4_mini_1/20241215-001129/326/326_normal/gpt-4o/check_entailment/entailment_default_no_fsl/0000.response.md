Correctness: **False**

The program does not accurately follow the problem description for every potential case. While the algorithm correctly identifies the minimum difference between consecutive elements in a sorted array, it fails to handle cases where the array contains duplicate values or when non-consecutive elements yield a smaller difference. 

For instance, if the input is `(1, 3, 3, 8)` with `n = 4`, the minimum difference is `0` because of the two `3`s. However, the current implementation will return `2` since it is only checking the differences between unique consecutive elements in the sorted array. Thus, it misses out on the correct minimum difference of `0`, proving that the implementation can fail under circumstances where there are duplicate values in the array.
