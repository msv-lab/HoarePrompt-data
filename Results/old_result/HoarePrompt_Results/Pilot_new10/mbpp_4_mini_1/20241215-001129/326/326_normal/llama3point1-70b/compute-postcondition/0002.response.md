According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `arr`. The loop runs from `0` to `len(arr) - 2`, meaning that `arr` must have at least 2 elements for the loop to execute at all. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be `len(arr) - 2`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `arr` must contain at least 2 integers, and `i` starts at 0. 

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `target` is an integer, `min_diff` is positive infinity, `i` is 0**
