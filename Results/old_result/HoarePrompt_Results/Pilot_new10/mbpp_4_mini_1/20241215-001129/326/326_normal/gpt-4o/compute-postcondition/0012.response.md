The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`. The values of `arr`, `n`, `i`, and `diff` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr` greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, and `min_diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr` greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 1, `diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`, `min_diff` is equal to `arr[2] - arr[1]`.**
