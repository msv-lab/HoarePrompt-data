Postcondition: ***`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` is a positive integer equal to the length of `arr` that is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0. If `diff` (the difference between `arr[i + 1]` and `arr[i]`) is less than `min_diff`, then `min_diff` is updated to `diff`, and `diff` is equal to `arr[i + 1] - arr[i]`. Otherwise, `min_diff` remains unchanged.***
