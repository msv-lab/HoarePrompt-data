Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`. It returns the smallest absolute difference between any two adjacent elements in the sorted list `arr`. If `arr` contains fewer than 2 elements, the function will return positive infinity since the calculation of differences is not feasible. However, the variable `target` is accepted as a parameter but is not used in the function, making it irrelevant to the final output. **
