The variable `min_diff` is assigned the value of `diff`, which is calculated as `arr[3] - arr[2]`. Since `arr` is a sorted list of integers, `diff` holds the difference between the third and second elements of the array. The values of `arr`, `n`, and `i` are not modified by this operation.

Output State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers, `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2], min_diff` is equal to `arr[3] - arr[2]**
