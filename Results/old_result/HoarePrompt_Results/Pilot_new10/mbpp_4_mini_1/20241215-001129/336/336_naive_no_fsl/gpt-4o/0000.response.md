Correctness: **False**

The provided program checks whether every element at odd indices (1, 3, 5, ...) in the list is an odd number. However, it fails to handle the case where the input list contains no elements, leading to the following situation:

Input case: `func_1([])`

For an empty list, the function will return `True` because there are no odd indices that can have even numbers (since there are no indices at all). However, based on the problem description, if there are no odd indexed elements in the list, the function's expected behavior is ambiguous and not clearly defined. 

Additionally, let's say we have a list with an even number of elements where the last odd index is valid but not odd itself:
Input case: `func_1([2, 4, 6, 8])`

For this input, the function would erroneously return `False`, ignoring the fact that there are no odd indexed elements actually present to contradict the rule because it does not validate the odd indices comprehensively.

Thus, the function does not account for all edge cases and can lead to incorrect outputs given certain inputs.
