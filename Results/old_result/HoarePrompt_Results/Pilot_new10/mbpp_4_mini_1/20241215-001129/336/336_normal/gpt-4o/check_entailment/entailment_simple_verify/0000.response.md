Final: **True**

The original assessment indicated that the correctness of the program was **False** due to its inability to handle cases where the list length is shorter than 2. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code and the problem description, it's clear that the function's design effectively checks only the odd indices. 

The function correctly returns `True` for empty lists or lists with a single integer because there are no odd indices to evaluate, which aligns with the expectation that the absence of odd indices results in a valid condition met. Since the original assessment did not take into account that those cases are implicitly handled by returning `True`, I conclude the program does indeed fulfill the requirement as stated.

Thus, the function adheres to the problem description while the logic is sound for an assumed valid input case.
