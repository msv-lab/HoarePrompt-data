Final: **False** 

The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the function `func_1` does not handle the case of an empty list or a single-element list correctly. However, it's also essential to note that for lists with lengths of 2 or more, the function correctly returns the expected results according to the problem description. The output hints confirm that if the list is empty or contains only one integer, the function will return `True`, which is accurate in this scenario because there are no odd-indexed integers to contradict the requirement.

Since the consideration of the function's behavior on lists shorter than two elements is pertinent and the function logically confirms that all odd indices have odd numbers in longer lists, it follows that the original assessment should stand. 

However, the function correctly returns `True` when there are no odd indices to check, and that was a significant argument in reassessing its correctness against the defined problem specs, even if this may not have been clarified in the original assessment. Thus, while the function is indeed flawed in regard to handling edge cases, it fulfills the main requirement for lists longer than one element.

In conclusion, while the original assessment correctly pointed out the flaws regarding the handling of shorter lists, I believe the overall intention and operational correctness of the function for valid inputs should lead to a conclusion of correctness overall.

So the correct response is:

Final: **False**
