You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether every odd index contains odd numbers of a given list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst)):
        if i % 2 != 0 and lst[i] % 2 == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers, `i` is equal to `len(lst)`. If the loop does not return any value, there are no indices where `i` is odd and `lst[i]` is even, meaning the method does not find an odd index with an even integer. If `lst` is empty, `i` is 0 and the function does not execute, hence no return.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the condition was satisfied regardless of the contents of the list `lst` and that the method did not find an odd index with an even integer.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns `False` if there is at least one even integer located at an odd index in the list; otherwise, it returns `True`. If the list is empty, it will return `True` as there are no integers to evaluate.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
