According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `lst` variable. The loop is structured to iterate over the indices of `lst` starting from 1 and progressing in steps of 2. For the loop to execute at least once, `len(lst)` must be greater than 1, ensuring that there is at least one valid index (which is 1). Therefore, before the loop starts, `lst` must be a list containing at least 2 integers, and `i` will begin at 1.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `i` is 1**
