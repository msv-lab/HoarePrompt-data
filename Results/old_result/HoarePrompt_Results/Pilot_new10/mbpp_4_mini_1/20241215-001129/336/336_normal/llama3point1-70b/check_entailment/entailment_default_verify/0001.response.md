The original assessment accurately evaluates the program's functionality in relation to the problem description. The program correctly implements a check to determine whether every odd index of a list contains an odd number, returning `True` when the conditions are satisfied and `False` otherwise. 

The output hints summarize this functionality well, confirming that the function indeed returns `False` if there is at least one even integer at an odd index, and `True` for all other cases, including the empty list scenario. 

The analysis of edge cases provided in the original assessment aligns with expected outcomes, demonstrating that the program covers various scenarios appropriately. Since the program fulfills the requirements laid out by the problem description, the conclusion reached in the original assessment is correct.

Final: **True**
