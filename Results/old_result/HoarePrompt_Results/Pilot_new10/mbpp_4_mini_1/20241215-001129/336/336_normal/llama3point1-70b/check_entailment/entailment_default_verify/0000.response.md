Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The function `func_1(lst)` correctly fulfills the problem's requirement to check whether every odd index in the list contains odd numbers. The logic of the function is correct as it iterates through the indices of the list, identifying the odd indices and ensuring that they contain odd numbers. The output hints confirm this behavior, stating that the function returns `False` if it finds an even integer at an odd index. 

The implementation indeed handles various potential edge cases such as empty lists or lists without any odd indices correctly. Therefore, after considering the problem description, the program logic, and the output hints, the correctness is confirmed to be **True**.
