Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` is intended to check whether every odd index of a given list contains odd numbers. However, there is a logical flaw in the implementation. The program does not handle the case where the list length is shorter than 2, which means there are no odd indices to check. 

For example, if we test the function with an empty list `[]`, it would return `True`, which is incorrect since there are no indices to make that determination. Similarly, when provided with a single-element list `[2]`, it would also return `True`, which is again incorrect because there are no odd indices.

Thus, the program fails for those scenarios, hence it does not correctly follow the problem description for every potential case.
