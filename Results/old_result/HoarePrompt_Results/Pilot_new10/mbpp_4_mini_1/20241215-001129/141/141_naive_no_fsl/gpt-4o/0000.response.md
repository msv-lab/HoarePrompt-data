To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program `func_1`, I'll analyze the program according to the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The function should take an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

### Program Logic:
1. The program converts the integer into a string to examine its digits.
2. It counts the frequency of each digit using a dictionary.
3. Finally, it checks if the frequency of each digit is less than or equal to its value (converted back to an integer).

### Test Cases Analyzed:
- `func_1(1234)` returns `True`: the digits are 1, 2, 3, 4 and their frequencies are all 1, which is <= to their values.
- `func_1(51241)` returns `False`: the digit 1 appears twice which is > 1. Thus correct according to the problem description.
- `func_1(321)` returns `True`: the digits are 3, 2, 1 with frequencies of each being 1, which is <= to their values.

### Potential Edge Case:
An edge case I can think of is when the number is `0` or contains zeroes, e.g.:
- `func_1(1002)`

For `1002`:
- The frequencies would be: `1` appears 1 time, `0` appears 2 times, and `2` appears 1 time.
- However, the digit `0` cannot have a frequency greater than `0`, but here it appears twice.

### Conclusion:
Since `func_1(1002)` would incorrectly return `True` when it should return `False`, the program does not address the case where digits can be `0`, and thus does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
