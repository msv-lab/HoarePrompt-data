The program indeed adheres to the problem description. Hereâ€™s the evaluation:

1. **Problem Analysis**: The problem requires checking whether the frequency of each digit in a non-negative integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

2. **Program Functionality**: The provided function (`func_1`) works as follows:
   - It first converts the integer `n` into its string representation (`str_n`).
   - It then iterates through each digit in `str_n`.
   - For each digit, it checks if the count of that digit in the entire string representation (`str_n.count(digit)`) is greater than the integer value of the digit (`int(digit)`).
   - If any digit's count exceeds its value, the function returns `False`.
   - If none of the digits violate this condition, the function ultimately returns `True`.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - For `n = 0`: The string representation is `"0"`, and there are no digits to check against, so it returns `True` trivially.
   - For any other non-negative integer, every digit is checked against its frequency, ensuring compliance with the problem description.

4. **Assessment of Correctness**: The code logically fulfills the requirement set out by the problem description. It checks the frequency of digits correctly and evaluates the condition of frequency being less than or equal to the digit.

Because the function accurately implements the specified logic and checks the conditions required by the problem statement without exception, we conclude that it is indeed correct.

Correctness: **True**
