Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, and `digit` is the next character in `str_n`. If the count of `digit` in `str_n` is greater than the integer value of `digit`, the function returns False. If the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`, no return value is specified.***
