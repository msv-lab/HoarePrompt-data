Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The function is designed to take a single non-negative integer `n` as input. This matches the requirement that the function should operate on non-negative integers.

2. **Frequency Calculation**: 
   - The function converts the integer `n` into its string representation. 
   - It then calculates the frequency of each digit using a dictionary. This step ensures that the count of each digit is correctly recorded.

3. **Frequency Comparison**: 
   - The function loops through each digit in the frequency dictionary and compares the frequency of that digit (`count`) to the integer value of the digit (`int(digit)`).
   - If the count of any digit is greater than its integer value, the function returns `False`. This directly adheres to the requirement of the problem description that states the frequency of each digit must be less than or equal to the digit itself.

4. **Return Value**: 
   - If all digits satisfy the frequency condition, the function returns `True`. This is the expected output when the digits meet the problem's criteria.

The assertions made in the annotated program serve as test cases to validate the function's implementation, providing further assurance that it behaves as required.

Overall, the function thoroughly checks the digit frequency against the specified conditions in the problem statement, which confirms its correctness.
