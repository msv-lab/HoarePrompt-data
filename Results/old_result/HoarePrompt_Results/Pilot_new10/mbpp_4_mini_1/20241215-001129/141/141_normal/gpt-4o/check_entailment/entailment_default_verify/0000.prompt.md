You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
Program:
```
assert func_1(1234) == True
assert func_1(51241) == False
assert func_1(321) == True

def func_1(n):
    digit_str = str(n)
    frequency = {}
    for digit in digit_str:
        if digit in frequency:
            frequency[digit] += 1
        else:
            frequency[digit] = 1
    for (digit, count) in frequency.items():
        if count > int(digit):
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The provided program checks whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself. However, it fails to handle the case for the digit '0'. 

For example, consider the input `100`, which has a frequency count of {'1': 1, '0': 2}. Here, the digit '0' has a frequency of 2, but since its value is 0, the condition should return `False`. However, since the code does not explicitly handle digits that are 0, it would incorrectly evaluate this case and return `True`.

Since the program does not correctly account for the frequency of '0', it does not meet the problem description's requirements for all potential inputs.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks the frequency of each digit in `n`. It returns `False` if the count of any digit exceeds its integer value. If all digit counts are less than or equal to their respective digit values, it returns `True`. The function doesn't handle invalid inputs (like negative numbers) explicitly, though the function is intended for non-negative integers according to the initial condition. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
