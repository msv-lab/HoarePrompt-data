Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. For example, consider the input `n = 222`. In this case, the digit `2` appears three times, but since `2` can only appear at most two times according to its integer value, the program should return `False`. However, the current implementation will not account for this correctly.

Another failure case is for `n = 121`, where `1` occurs twice, exceeding its value of `1`. The expected output should be `False`, but again, the program would not function correctly if we checked it against other similar numbers.

Overall, there are multiple scenarios where the counts of digits exceed their allowed integer values, and the current implementation will not consistently return the correct result for all cases. Thus, the program is incorrect.
