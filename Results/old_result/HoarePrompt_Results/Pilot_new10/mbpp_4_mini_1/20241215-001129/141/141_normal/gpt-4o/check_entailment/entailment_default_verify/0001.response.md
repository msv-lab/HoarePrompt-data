Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate. The program does not correctly handle the case where the digit `0` appears in the integer. As noted, if `0` appears in the input, its frequency cannot be greater than `0`, leading to incorrect results. The example `func_1(1002)` demonstrates this flaw: the digit `0` appears twice, which should return `False`, but the program would incorrectly return `True`. Thus, the program fails to meet the problem requirements for all potential cases, confirming the correctness of the original assessment.
