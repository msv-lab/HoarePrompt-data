The original assessment identified that the program does not handle cases where the digit `0` appears in the integer. This is a crucial part of the problem description, as the digit `0` should not appear with a frequency greater than `0`, which was exemplified through the case `func_1(1002)`.

The annotated version of the code corroborates this understanding by clarifying that the function checks the frequency of each digit but does not appropriately handle the case of `0`. Thus, if an input like `1002` is processed, the function would return `True` even though it should return `False`.

Given this analysis, the initial assessment that the program is incorrect remains accurate, as the presence of the digit `0` in any input leads to a situation where the frequency can be greater than the value of the digit itself.

Final: **False**
