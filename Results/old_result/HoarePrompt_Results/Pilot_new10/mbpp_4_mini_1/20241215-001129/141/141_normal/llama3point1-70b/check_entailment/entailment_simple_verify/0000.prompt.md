You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function takes in an integer and check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To analyze the provided program against the problem description, we need to determine whether it correctly checks if the frequency of each digit in an integer is less than or equal to the digit itself.

### Program Analysis:
Problem description: Check whether the frequency of each digit in the integer `n` is less than or equal to the digit itself.

Program provided:
```python
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
    return True
```

### Breakdown:
1. **Input Conversion**: The input integer `n` is converted to a string `str_n` to analyze each digit.
2. **Frequency Count**: For each digit (`digit`), the frequency of that digit in `str_n` is counted using `str_n.count(digit)`.
3. **Comparison**: It checks if this count is greater than the integer value of the digit (`int(digit)`).
4. **Return**:
   - If any digit's frequency exceeds its value, it returns `False`.
   - If all digits satisfy the condition, it returns `True`.

### Edge Cases:
- **Zero as a Digit**: If `n` contains the digit '0', then the program would still return `True` since `count('0')` cannot be greater than `0`.
- **Single Digit and Repeated Digits**: For example, `n = 222`, where the frequency of '2' is `3`, but is not checked against the logic appropriately since `3 > 2` should return `False`.

### Test Cases:
Testing the program against several inputs:
- Input: `100` should return `False` because it contains a '0' which appears `1` time where it should be less than or equal to `0`.
- Input: `222` should return `False` since '2' appears `3` times.
- Input: `21` should return `True` since '2' appears once and '1' appears once.

The program fails in scenarios where a digit has to appear more than it should be allowed according to the description, particularly with `0`.

### Conclusion:
The provided program does not correctly handle cases where the digit frequency exceeds the limit set by the digit's value itself.

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    str_n = str(n)
    for digit in str_n:
        if str_n.count(digit) > int(digit):
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer, `str_n` is the string representation of `n`, if the loop executes then for every `digit` in `str_n`, the count of `digit` in `str_n` is less than or equal to the integer value of `digit`. If the loop does not execute, the condition holds trivially since there are no `digit` characters to evaluate.
    return True
    #The program returns True, confirming that the condition holds for each digit in the string representation of the non-negative integer n or trivially holds if n is 0.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
