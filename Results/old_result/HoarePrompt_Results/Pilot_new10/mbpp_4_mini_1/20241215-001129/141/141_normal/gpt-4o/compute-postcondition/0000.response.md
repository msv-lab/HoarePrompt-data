`digit_str` is assigned the value of `n` converted to a string. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` will be a string representation of that non-negative integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`**.
