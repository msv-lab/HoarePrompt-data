The variable `frequency` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The other variables, `n` and `digit_str`, are unchanged at this point. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, and `frequency` is an empty dictionary.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `digit_str` is the string representation of `n`, `frequency` is an empty dictionary.**
