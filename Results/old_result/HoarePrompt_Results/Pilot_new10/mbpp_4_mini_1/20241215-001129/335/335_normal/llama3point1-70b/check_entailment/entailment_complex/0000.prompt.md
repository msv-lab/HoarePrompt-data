You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string. Return None if there is no match.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: string is a non-empty string, and substring is a non-empty string that is shorter than or equal to string.
def func_1(string, substring):
    start = string.find(substring)
    if (start == -1) :
        return None
        #The program returns None, indicating that the substring was not found in the string.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string that is shorter than or equal to `string`, and `start` is a non-negative integer representing the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`.
    end = start + len(substring)
    return substring, start, end - 1
    #The program returns substring, the starting index start, and the ending index end - 1, where end is equal to start + len(substring)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty string and a non-empty substring and checks whether the substring exists within the string. If the substring is found, it returns the substring along with its starting index and ending index within the string. If the substring is not found, it returns None. There are no checks in place for the case where the substring is the same length as the string or if it appears multiple times; the function only reports the first occurrence.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
