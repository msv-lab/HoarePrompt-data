The variable `start` is assigned the value `string.find(substring)`, which returns the lowest index in `string` where `substring` is found. Given that `substring` is a non-empty string that is shorter than or equal to `string`, the value of `start` will be an integer representing the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`. If `substring` is not found, `start` will be `-1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`string` is a non-empty string, `substring` is a non-empty string that is shorter than or equal to `string`, `start` is the index of the first occurrence of `substring` in `string`, or `-1` if not found.**
