Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly follow the problem description because it fails to account for multiple occurrences of the substring within the main string. According to the problem, the function should find all occurrences and their positions, returning None only if there are no matches at all.

In the provided implementation, the function `func_1` only finds the first occurrence of the substring in the main string. If the substring appears multiple times, the function will not return information about those other occurrences. Additionally, if the substring is not found, it correctly returns None. However, the requirement to find all occurrences and positions is not met.

For example, in the case of the string 'python programming, python language' with the substring 'python', the function will only return the first occurrence and not account for the occurrence later in the string.

To summarize, the program is incorrect because it does not meet the requirement of finding all occurrences of the substring, which leads to incomplete results when there are multiple occurrences.
