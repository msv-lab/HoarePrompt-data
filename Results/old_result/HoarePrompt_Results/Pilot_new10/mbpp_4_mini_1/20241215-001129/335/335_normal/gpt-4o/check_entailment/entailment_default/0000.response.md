The given program is intended to find the occurrence and position of a substring within a main string and return a tuple with the substring and its start and end positions, or return None if the substring is not found.

The code provided performs the following operations:
1. It uses the `find` method to locate the starting position of the `sub_string` in `main_string`.
2. If the `sub_string` is not found (i.e., `find` returns -1), it returns None.
3. If found, it calculates the end position as the starting position plus the length of the `sub_string`.
4. Finally, it returns a tuple with the `sub_string`, its start position, and the calculated end position.

The output hints confirm that the function is intended to return a tuple with the substring and its indices or None. 

However, there is a flaw in the handling of substring occurrences. The `find` method only finds the first occurrence of the substring, and if there's a requirement implied that multiple occurrences should also be handled, this code does not address that scenario. 

Furthermore, the function does not handle the case where `main_string` may contain substrings that overlap with each other. For example:
- If we search for "ana" in "banana", the expected output could be the first occurrence (0, 3) or even a way to find all occurrences.

Given that there are scenarios where the current implementation does not meet the complete requirement of the problem as stated, specifically regarding multiple occurrences of substrings and overlap, we can conclude that the implementation does not fulfill the problem description adequately.

Correctness: **False**. 

The assertion tests given may work correctly with the current implementation, but since the description does not specify that only the first occurrence is to be returned (and multiple occurrences, overlaps, or any further clarifications aren't addressed), the program is incomplete and hence incorrect.
