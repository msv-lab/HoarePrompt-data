Final: **False**. 

The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the program does not handle cases where the substring occurs multiple times in the main string. The problem description explicitly asks for finding all occurrences and their positions, which the current implementation does not fulfill; it only returns the first occurrence found. The annotations confirm that the program is designed to return information about only the first occurrence, reinforcing the original assessment's correctness. Therefore, the program is indeed incomplete according to the problem description.
