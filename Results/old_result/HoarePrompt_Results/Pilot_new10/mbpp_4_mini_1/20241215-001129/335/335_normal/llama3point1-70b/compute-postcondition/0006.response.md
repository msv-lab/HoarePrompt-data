The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `string`, which is a non-empty string, and `substring`, which is a non-empty string that is shorter than or equal to `string`. After executing the function body, if the `substring` is not found in the `string`, the function returns `None`. If the `substring` is found, the function returns the `substring`, the starting index `start`, and the ending index `end - 1`, where `end` is equal to `start + len(substring)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string and a substring, and it returns either None if the substring is not found or the substring along with its starting and ending indices if it is found.

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-empty string and a non-empty substring, returns None if the substring is not found in the string; otherwise, it returns the substring with its starting index and ending index.**
