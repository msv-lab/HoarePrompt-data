Correctness: **False**.

The given program is supposed to find the occurrence and position of the substrings within a string according to the problem description. However, it fails in handling multiple occurrences of the substring in the main string. 

For example, if we test the string `'python programming, python language'` for the substring `'python'`, it is expected to return the position of the first occurrence of `'python'`, which the code does correctly. However, since the substring appears twice, the program does not address that.

To illustrate the failing case:
```python
assert func_1('python python python', 'python') == ('python', 0, 6)  # should return the first occurrence
assert func_1('python python python', 'python') == ('python', 7, 13)  # second occurrence, this case is not handled
```
The positions of multiple occurrences were not considered in the initial implementation, thus resulting in incorrect behavior when more than one occurrence exists. 

Additionally, the assertion `assert func_1('c++ programming, c++ language', 'python') == None` is fine; it checks for a substring not present in the main string, which is handled correctly. 

Due to the lack of support for multiple occurrences of the substring and the potential for misunderstanding regarding the expected output format, the overall implementation does not fully meet the problem's requirements. Therefore, the correctness is deemed false.
