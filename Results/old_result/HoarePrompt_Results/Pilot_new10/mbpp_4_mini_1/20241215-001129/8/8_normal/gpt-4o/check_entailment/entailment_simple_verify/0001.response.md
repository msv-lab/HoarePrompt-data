After reviewing the problem description, the program implementation, the original assessment, and the annotated version of the program, I conclude the following:

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` handles various cases as intended by the problem description. It accurately discusses how the function works and examines several edge cases, confirming that it behaves correctly in those scenarios.

The annotated version of the code supports the original assessment:
- The function checks if the character exists in the string at all (both first and last occurrences).
- If the character is found and occurs more than once, it constructs a new string with the first and last occurrences removed.
- The annotations clearly outline the states at different points, thereby confirming that the function operates as expected.

In conclusion, since the function meets the requirements of the problem statement and the assessment accurately reflects its correctness, the final assessment is:

Final: **True**
