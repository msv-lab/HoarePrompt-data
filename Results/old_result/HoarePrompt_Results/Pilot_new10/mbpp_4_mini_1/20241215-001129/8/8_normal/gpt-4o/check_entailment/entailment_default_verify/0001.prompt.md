You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
Program:
```
assert func_1('hello', 'l') == 'heo'
assert func_1('abcda', 'a') == 'bcd'
assert func_1('PHP', 'P') == 'H'

def func_1(s: str, ch: str) -> str:
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index:
        return s
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the implementation of the function `func_1`.

1. The function takes a string `s` and a character `ch`.
2. It finds the first occurrence of `ch` using `s.find(ch)` and the last occurrence using `s.rfind(ch)`.
3. If either occurrence is not found (indicated by `-1`), or if the first and last indices are the same, the original string `s` is returned.
4. If both indices are valid and different, the function constructs a new string by removing `ch` at both the first and last occurrences.

Now we will examine cases where the function could fail:

- **Case 1: Character not present in the string**
  - Input: `func_1("hello", "x")`
  - Expected output: `"hello"` (since the character 'x' is not present)
  - Actual output: `"hello"` (since the function will trigger the return of `s` due to `first_index == -1`).

- **Case 2: The character appears only once**
  - Input: `func_1("a", "a")`
  - Expected output: `""` (since we should remove the only occurrence of 'a')
  - Actual output: `""` (the function must return the substring which excludes both the first and only occurrence).

- **Case 3: The string contains consecutive occurrences of the character**
  - Input: `func_1("aaa", "a")`
  - Expected output: `""` (removing the first 'a' and the last 'a' leaves the string empty).
  - Actual output: `""` (the function correctly removes both characters).

- **Case 4: String with no characters**
  - Input: `func_1("", "a")`
  - Expected output: `""` (no characters to remove).
  - Actual output: `""` (no errors).

Despite being tested with a few string configurations, one edge case has revealed an issue.

- **Case 5: Removing only first and last occurs when first and last are the same**
  - Input: `func_1("aba", "a")`
  - Expected output: `"b"` (remove both occurrences of 'a').
  - Actual output: `"b"` (the function works properly in this case).

Now, let's analyze what happens when the character is either at the boundaries or simply appears at least twice. 

However, notice that cases such as different letters which might mislead the assumptions may yield edge cases where it might not remove as expected. 

After testing a range of potential edge cases, the function appears efficient and correctly removes the first and last occurrences of `ch` under general conditions. 

Conclusion:

After examining potential edge cases, the function seems to meet the problem requirements without revealing an inconsistency in behavior for any scenario. Therefore, the final analysis is as follows:

Correctness: **True** 

The code correctly handles the required cases described in the problem statement. All test cases have shown expected results based on the description, and the code returns the correct output across different tested scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `ch`, returning `s` unchanged if `ch` is not found in `s`, or if `ch` appears only once in `s`. If `ch` occurs more than once, the function returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
