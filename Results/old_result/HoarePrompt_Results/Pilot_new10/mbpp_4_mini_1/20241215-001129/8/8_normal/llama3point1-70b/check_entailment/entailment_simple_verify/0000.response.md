Final: **False**

The original assessment states that the program is incorrect because it does not handle the case when the character occurs only once. However, upon reviewing the annotated version of the code, it becomes clear that when the character appears only once in the string, the program indeed handles that case correctly by calling `s.replace(char, '', 1)`. This removes the first occurrence of the character when it is the only instance. 

The original assessment also mentions potential issues with cases where the character does not exist in the string or appears multiple times, indicating that the function would not handle these edge cases adequately. However, the annotated version of the code clarifies that the function returns the string as is in such instances, which aligns with expected behavior.

The program correctly removes the first and last occurrences of the character based on the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the original assessment, which deemed the program incorrect, does not accurately reflect the program's performance based on the provided definitions. 

Thus, the program is indeed correct, and the final assessment reflects that.
