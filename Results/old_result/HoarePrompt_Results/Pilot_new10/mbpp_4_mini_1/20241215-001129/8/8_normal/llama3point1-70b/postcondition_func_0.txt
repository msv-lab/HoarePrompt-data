The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `char`. It returns a modified version of `s`: if `char` appears only once in `s`, the function removes that single occurrence; if `char` appears more than once, it removes both the first and last occurrences of `char`; if `char` is not present in `s`, the function returns `s` unchanged. This functionality correctly handles cases when `char` appears multiple times, only once, or not at all.
