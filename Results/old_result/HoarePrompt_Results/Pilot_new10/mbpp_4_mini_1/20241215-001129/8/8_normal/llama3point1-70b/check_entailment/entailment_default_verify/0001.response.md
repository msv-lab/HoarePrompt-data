The original assessment concluded that the implementation is incorrect due to a lack of handling unexpected input types, such as `None` or non-string types. However, the output hints explicitly state that the function expects a valid string and a character, implying that it will be provided valid input according to the problem description.

By focusing on strictly valid inputs as hinted, the program appears to correctly implement the required functionality as stated in the problem description. The function handles cases of removing the first and last occurrences of a character, handling single occurrences, multiple occurrences, and cases where the character does not exist in the string as expected.

Since the assessment's indication of incorrectness was based on handling invalid inputs, which are not anticipated according to the given problem constraints, this suggests the assessment made an error in evaluating the program's correctness based on valid input expectations.

Final: **True**.
