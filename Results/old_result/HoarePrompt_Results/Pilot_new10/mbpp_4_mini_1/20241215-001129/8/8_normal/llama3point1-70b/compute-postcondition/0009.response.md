The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `char`, which is a single character. 

In different scenarios, the function behaves as follows:
- Case 1: If `char` appears only once in `s`, the function returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of the character `char` removed.
- Case 2: If `char` appears more than once in `s`, the function returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of `char` removed, as well as the last occurrence of `char`, while keeping the rest of the string intact.
- Case 3: If `char` is not present in `s`, the function simply returns the string `s` unchanged.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character `char`, and return the string with modifications based on the occurrences of `char`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `char`. It returns a modified version of `s` based on the occurrences of `char`: removing the first occurrence if `char` appears once, removing the first and last occurrence if `char` appears more than once, or returning `s` unchanged if `char` is not present.**
