You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
Program:
```
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1:
        if first_occurrence == last_occurrence:
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
        else:
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[last_occurrence + 1:]
    else:
        return s


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when there is only one occurrence of the specified character in the string. According to the problem description, if the character occurs only once, it should be removed from the string, but the current implementation replaces it with an empty string in the line `return s.replace(char, '', 1)` and does not handle the edge case correctly when `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`.

For example:
- If the input string is `"a"` and the character is `"a"`, the expected output is `""` (an empty string), since the only occurrence should be removed. However, as per the function's logic, it would incorrectly replace it in the context of `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` and return an empty string.

Another problematic case is:
- If the input string is `"abc"` and the character is `"d"` (which does not exist in the string), the function should return `"abc"`, which it correctly does. However, if we wanted to specify an output behavior that applies specifically to cases where the character exists only once, we see that the logic does not guarantee that all such cases are handled solely.

Thus, since there are cases of single occurrences that are not handled according to the problem description, the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string, and char is a single character.
def func_1(s, char):
    first_occurrence = s.find(char)
    last_occurrence = s.rfind(char)
    if (first_occurrence != -1 and last_occurrence != -1) :
        if (first_occurrence == last_occurrence) :
            return s.replace(char, '', 1)
            #The program returns the string `s` with the first occurrence of the character `char` removed, as `char` appears only once in `s`.
        else :
            return s[:first_occurrence] + s[first_occurrence + 1:last_occurrence] + s[
    last_occurrence + 1:]
            #The program returns the string 's' with the first occurrence of 'char' removed, as well as the last occurrence of 'char', while keeping the rest of the string intact.
    else :
        return s
        #The program returns the string 's' regardless of the presence of 'char' in it


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
