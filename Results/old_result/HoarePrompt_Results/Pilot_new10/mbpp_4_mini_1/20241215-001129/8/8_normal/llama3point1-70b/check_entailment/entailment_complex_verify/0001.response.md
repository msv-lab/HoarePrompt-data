Based on the provided problem description and the subsequent analysis regarding the function `func_1`, it is clear that the function is designed to handle cases where it removes the first and last occurrence of a specified character from a string. 

The annotated version of the program reaffirms that the function behaves as intended in scenarios where valid inputs are provided. It correctly identifies when to remove occurrences of the character and appropriately returns the modified string when conditions are met. 

While the original assessment noted that the function does not handle edge cases such as incorrect types of input, the clarification provided in the task states that the assumption is that input will always be valid. Given this assumption and the fact that the function correctly handles all specified behaviors within the constraints of valid input (removing the first and the last occurrence of the character, leaving the string unchanged if the character is absent, etc.), the original statement of correctness can be accepted.

Thus, my conclusion is consistent with the original assessment regarding the program's functionality given valid inputs.

Final: **True**.
