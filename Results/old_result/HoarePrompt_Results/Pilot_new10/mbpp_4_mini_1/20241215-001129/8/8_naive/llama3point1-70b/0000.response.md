Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when there is only one occurrence of the specified character in the string. According to the problem description, if the character occurs only once, it should be removed from the string, but the current implementation replaces it with an empty string in the line `return s.replace(char, '', 1)` and does not handle the edge case correctly when `first_occurrence` equals `last_occurrence`.

For example:
- If the input string is `"a"` and the character is `"a"`, the expected output is `""` (an empty string), since the only occurrence should be removed. However, as per the function's logic, it would incorrectly replace it in the context of `first_occurrence` and `last_occurrence` and return an empty string.

Another problematic case is:
- If the input string is `"abc"` and the character is `"d"` (which does not exist in the string), the function should return `"abc"`, which it correctly does. However, if we wanted to specify an output behavior that applies specifically to cases where the character exists only once, we see that the logic does not guarantee that all such cases are handled solely.

Thus, since there are cases of single occurrences that are not handled according to the problem description, the program is incorrect.
