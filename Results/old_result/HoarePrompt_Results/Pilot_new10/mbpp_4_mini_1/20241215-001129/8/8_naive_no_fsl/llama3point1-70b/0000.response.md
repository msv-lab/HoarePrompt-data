To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze it based on the problem description, which states that the goal is to remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.

### Analysis:

1. **Finding Occurrences**:
   - The program correctly uses `s.find(char)` to locate the first occurrence of `char` and `s.rfind(char)` to locate the last occurrence.

2. **Conditions**:
   - It checks if both occurrences are not equal to `-1`, meaning the character exists in the string.
   - If the first occurrence and last occurrence are the same, it implies there's only one instance of the character in the string. In this case, it uses `s.replace(char, '', 1)` to replace the first occurrence of `char`, effectively removing it.

3. **Removing Characters**:
   - If the first and last occurrences are different, it constructs a new string by concatenating the substring before the first occurrence, the substring between the first and last occurrences (excluding the first occurrence), and the substring after the last occurrence (excluding the last occurrence).
   
4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Returning the original string if the character is not found is correct.

### Potential Cases:

Now, let's consider potential edge cases to check correctness:
- **Case 1:** When `s` is an empty string (e.g., `func_1("", 'a')`).
  - It should return `""` since there are no characters to remove.
  
- **Case 2:** When `s` contains only one instance of the character (e.g., `func_1("abc", 'a')`).
  - It should return `""` removing the only occurrence.
  
- **Case 3:** When `s` contains the character in between (e.g., `func_1("abcabc", 'a')`).
  - It should return `"bc"`, removing both first and last `a`.
  
- **Case 4:** When there are multiple occurrences of the character and no other characters (e.g., `func_1("aaaaaa", 'a')`).
  - The expected output would be `aaaa` after removing the first and last `a`.

- **Case 5:** When the character does not exist in the string (e.g., `func_1("hello", 'x')`).
  - The output should be `hello`.

### Conclusion:

When analyzing the provided code against the above cases, I found that the program does seem to work correctly in the provided scenarios and expected outputs.

However, there is a case I overlooked: 

- Suppose `s` is `None` or an unexpected type (like an integer). The code may raise an AttributeError since it relies on string methods. 

### Result:

Therefore, the implementation does not handle all input types correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
