Final: **True**  

The original assessment appears to be accurate. The program correctly implements a function to determine whether the parity of a given integer `n` is odd using the condition `n % 2 != 0`. The annotated version reinforces this by stating that the function returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers. Since the function handles valid integer inputs as specified in the problem description and adheres to the expected behavior, I see no issues with its correctness. Therefore, the program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
