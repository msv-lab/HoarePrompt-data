Final: **True**

The original assessment of correctness is accurate. The function `func_1(n)` correctly implements the logic to check if the parity of a number is odd by using the expression `n % 2 != 0`. The function's purpose aligns with the problem description, which states that it should determine whether a given number's parity is odd.

The assertions check:
- `func_1(12)`, which is correctly evaluated as `False`, as 12 is even.
- `func_1(7)`, which is correctly evaluated as `True`, as 7 is odd.
- `func_1(10)`, which is correctly evaluated as `False`, as 10 is even.

The annotations clarify the function’s behavior and confirm that it assumes valid integer input. There are no discrepancies between the program and the problem description, and all test cases return the expected results, ensuring the program’s correctness. Thus, the final assessment remains True.
