The program provided correctly implements a function to determine whether the parity of a given integer is odd or even. The function `func_1(n)` returns `True` if the input `n` is odd (when `n % 2 != 0`) and `False` if it is even.

The assertions provided follow directly from the problem description:
- `func_1(12)` returns `False`, which is correct since 12 is even.
- `func_1(7)` returns `True`, which is correct since 7 is odd.
- `func_1(10)` returns `False`, which is correct since 10 is even.

The output hints also clarify that the function expects an integer input and that no edge cases or special input types are handled, assuming the input is always a valid integer. Since there's no indication of what could be a problematic input type (such as strings or floating-point numbers), we are led to conclude that the function should work for all valid integers as described.

Since the code meets the requirements of the problem description and works correctly for all tested integer cases while directly aligning with the output hints, I conclude that there are no evident cases where the function fails.

Correctness: **True**.
