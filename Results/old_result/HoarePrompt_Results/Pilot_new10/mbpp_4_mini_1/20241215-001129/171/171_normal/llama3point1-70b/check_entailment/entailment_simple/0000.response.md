Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements of the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` checks whether the parity of the integer `n` is odd. It does so by evaluating the expression `n % 2 != 0`. 

Here's why this implementation is correct:

1. **Input Type**: The function accepts an integer `n`, as specified in the problem description.
2. **Parity Check**: The expression `n % 2` computes the remainder of `n` when divided by 2:
   - If `n` is odd, `n % 2` will yield `1`, and `n % 2 != 0` will be `True`.
   - If `n` is even, `n % 2` will yield `0`, and `n % 2 != 0` will be `False`.
3. **Return Value**: The function returns `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers, which aligns perfectly with the requirement to check if the parity of the number is odd.

Therefore, the function always performs as described, confirming that it accurately fulfills the problem specification for determining the parity of a given number.
