Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` checks whether the parity of the integer `n` is odd by using the modulo operator `%`. The condition `n % 2 != 0` evaluates to `True` for odd integers and `False` for even integers. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why it meets the specifications:

1. Input: The function takes an integer `n` as input, which aligns with the requirement of the problem description.
2. Logic: The use of `n % 2` is a standard method for determining the parity of a number:
   - If `n` is odd (e.g., 1, 3, 5), `n % 2` will yield 1, therefore `n % 2 != 0` is `True`.
   - If `n` is even (e.g., 0, 2, 4), `n % 2` will yield 0, thus `n % 2 != 0` is `False`.
3. Output: The function returns a boolean value (`True` for odd and `False` for even), which directly answers the problem's requirement to find whether the parity of the number is odd.

The annotation clearly explains the functionality of the function, confirming that it checks for oddity correctly. The fact that the program does not handle non-integer inputs does not impact its correctness regarding the specified problem description, which only concerns integer inputs.

Thus, the function accurately implements the logic needed to determine if the provided integer is odd, fulfilling the requirements given in the problem description.
