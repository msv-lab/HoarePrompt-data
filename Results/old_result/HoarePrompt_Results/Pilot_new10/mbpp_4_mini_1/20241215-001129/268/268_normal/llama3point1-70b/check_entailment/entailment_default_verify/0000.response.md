Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate as the function does not handle edge cases that lead to potential errors. There are scenarios, such as when `n` is 0 or greater than or equal to the number of columns in the matrix, as well as when the matrix is empty, that would cause the function to raise an `IndexError`. The output hints confirm that these edge cases exist and that the function should ideally handle them, hence the original assessment stating the function is incorrect stands valid.
