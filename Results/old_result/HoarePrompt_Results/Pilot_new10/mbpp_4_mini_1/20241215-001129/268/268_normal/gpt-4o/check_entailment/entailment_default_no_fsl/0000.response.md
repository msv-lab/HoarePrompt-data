Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem. Specifically, it does not account for the case where the input matrix is empty. If the matrix is empty, attempting to access the nth column (as the code does) will raise an `IndexError`. This is an evident flaw since the function does not provide adequate error handling for such a scenario, thereby failing to meet the complete requirements of the problem description. 

For example, if we call `func_1([], 0)`, it will result in an error, which indicates that the function is not correctly implemented for all edge cases.
