Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not account for several potential edge cases. For instance:

1. If `n` is less than 1, it would lead to an `IndexError` because it tries to access `row[n - 1]`. This behavior is not defined in the problem description.
  
2. If the matrix is empty, attempting to get the maximum value will also cause an error.

3. If `n` is greater than the number of columns in any of the rows, an `IndexError` will occur as well.

As these scenarios are not handled, the function fails to correctly implement the requirements of the problem description.
