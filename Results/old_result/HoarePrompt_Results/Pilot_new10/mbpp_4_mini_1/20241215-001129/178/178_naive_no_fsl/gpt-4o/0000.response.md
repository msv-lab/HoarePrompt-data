Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement to round each number in the provided list, sum those rounded values, and then multiply the total sum by the length of the list. 

Here's a breakdown of the logic:

1. **Rounding**: The code uses the `round()` function, which is appropriate for rounding each number in the list.
2. **Summing**: The `sum()` function is used to calculate the total of the rounded numbers.
3. **Length**: The length of the list is obtained using `len(numbers)`, which correctly gives the count of the original list elements.
4. **Final Output**: The final result is calculated by multiplying the total sum of rounded numbers by the length of the original list, which follows the specified requirement.

All provided test cases yield the correct results:
- For `[22.4, 4.0, -16.22, -9.1, 11.0, -12.22, 14.2, -5.2, 17.5]`, rounding would yield `[22, 4, -16, -9, 11, -12, 14, -5, 18]` resulting in a sum of `27`, and then `27 * 9 = 243`.
- For `[5, 2, 9, 24.3, 29]`, rounding results in `[5, 2, 9, 24, 29]` for a sum of `69`, and then `69 * 5 = 345`.
- For `[25.0, 56.7, 89.2]`, the rounded numbers are `[25, 57, 89]` for a sum of `171`, and then `171 * 3 = 513`.

Therefore, I was unable to identify any cases where the provided program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. Hence, the conclusion is that the program is correct.
