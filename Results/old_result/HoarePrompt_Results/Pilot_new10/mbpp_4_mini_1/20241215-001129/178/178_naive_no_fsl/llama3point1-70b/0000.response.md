To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the given problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the code.

**Problem description:** Write a function to round every number of a given list of numbers and print the total sum multiplied by the length of the list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    return total_sum * len(numbers)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Rounding Numbers:** The code correctly rounds each number in the input list using the `round()` function and constructs a new list called `rounded_numbers`.
2. **Calculating Total Sum:** It then calculates the sum of the rounded numbers.
3. **Multiplying by Length:** Finally, it multiplies the total sum by the length of the input list (`len(numbers)`).

### Edge Cases to Consider:
- Empty List: If `numbers` is an empty list (`[]`), the length will be 0, leading to a multiplication of the sum (which is 0) by 0, resulting in 0. This case is correctly handled.
- Mixed Values: If the list contains negative, positive, or float values, they are rounded appropriately, and the sum is computed accurately.
- Non-integer numbers: The `round()` function handles non-integer floating-point numbers correctly.

### Test Cases:
1. **Empty List:** 
   - Input: `[]`
   - Output: `0 * 0 = 0` (which is correct)
   
2. **Positive and Negative Values:** 
   - Input: `[1.4, 2.5, -3.2]`
   - Rounding results in `[1, 3, -3]`, sum = `1 + 3 - 3` = `1`, and multiplying by the length (3) gives `1 * 3 = 3`.

3. **All Zeros:** 
   - Input: `[0, 0, 0]`
   - Rounding stays `[0, 0, 0]`, total sum = `0`, and output is `0 * 3 = 0`.

4. **Non-integer Floats:**
   - Input: `[1.5, 2.4, 3.6]`
   - Rounding results in `[2, 2, 4]`, sum = `2 + 2 + 4` = `8`, output = `8 * 3 = 24`.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly handles rounding of numbers, summation, and multiplication by the length of the list, accounting for different possible input scenarios. 

Since no potential input case has been found where the program does not behave as expected, we can conclude that the program meets the problem requirements in all scenarios.

Correctness: **True**
