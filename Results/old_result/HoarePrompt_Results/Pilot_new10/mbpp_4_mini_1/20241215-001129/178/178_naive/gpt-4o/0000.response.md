Correctness: **False**.

The logic for rounding numbers and calculating the total sum multiplied by the length of the list appears to function correctly. However, the program improperly handles the case when the input list is empty. In this situation, the program will cause a ZeroDivisionError when it tries to multiply the total sum by `len(numbers)`, which would be zero, resulting in an invalid operation. 

For example, calling `func_1([])` would lead to an error, demonstrating a flaw in the implementation since the function fails to account for an empty list.
