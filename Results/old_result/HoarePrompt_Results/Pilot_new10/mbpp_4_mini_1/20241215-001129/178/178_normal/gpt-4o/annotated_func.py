#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of numerical values (integers or floats).
def func_1(numbers):
    rounded_numbers = [round(num) for num in numbers]
    total_sum = sum(rounded_numbers)
    result = total_sum * len(numbers)
    return result
    #The program returns the result, which is equal to total_sum multiplied by the length of the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of numerical values (integers or floats) and returns the product of the total sum of these numbers after rounding each number to the nearest integer and the length of the list. It does not handle the case where the input list is empty, which would lead to a multiplication by zero in the returned result.
