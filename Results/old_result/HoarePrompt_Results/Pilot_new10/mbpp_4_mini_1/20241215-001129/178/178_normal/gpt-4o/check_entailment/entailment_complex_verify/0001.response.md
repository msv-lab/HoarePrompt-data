The original assessment of the program's correctness is accurate. The function `func_1` effectively fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Functionality Alignment**: The function rounds each number in the provided list accurately using the `round()` function. This adheres to the specification of the problem, which explicitly requires rounding.

2. **Summation and Length Calculation**: The function computes the sum of the rounded numbers using `sum()`, and correctly calculates the length of the input list with `len(numbers)`. This aligns with the requirement to multiply the total sum by the length of the list.

3. **Correctness of Test Cases**: The provided test cases all produce the expected results based on the logic in the function. Each call to `func_1` is verified against expected outputs, all of which validate the correctness of the implementation.

4. **Impact of Empty List**: The annotated version mentions that the function does not handle the case of an empty list, which would indeed lead to a multiplication by zero, producing an output of `0`. However, since we are assuming valid input as specified (not an empty list), this is not a concern for the assessment's context. The detailed analysis of the behavior given valid inputs confirms that the function performs correctly.

Therefore, the original assessment's conclusion that the program is correct stands. 

Final: **True**
