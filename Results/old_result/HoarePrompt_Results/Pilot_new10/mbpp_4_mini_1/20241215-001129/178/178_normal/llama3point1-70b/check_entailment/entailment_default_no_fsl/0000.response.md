Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It rounds each number in the input list, calculates the total sum of these rounded values, and then multiplies this sum by the length of the list. The handling of an empty list is also appropriate, as the multiplication by zero (the length of the list) will yield zero, which is the expected output for an empty input.

Since no edge cases or scenarios contradict the problem description, the code satisfies all potential cases correctly. Thus, it can be deemed correct.
