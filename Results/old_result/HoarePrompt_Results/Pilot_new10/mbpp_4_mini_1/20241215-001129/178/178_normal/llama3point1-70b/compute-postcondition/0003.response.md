The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `numbers`. `numbers` is a list of real numbers. After executing the function body, the function calculates the sum of the rounded values of `numbers` (referred to as `total_sum`) and then multiplies `total_sum` by the number of elements in the `numbers` list (denoted as `len(numbers)`). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of real numbers `numbers` and return the product of the sum of the rounded values of the numbers in the list and the count of elements in that list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `numbers`, which is a list of real numbers, and returns the product of the sum of the rounded values of `numbers` and the number of elements in `numbers`.**
