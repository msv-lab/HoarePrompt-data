Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. According to the problem description, the function should round every number in the provided list and calculate the total sum multiplied by the length of the list. However, if the list is empty, `len(numbers)` would be zero, leading to a multiplication by zero, which would return zero. This behavior contradicts the expectation laid out in the output hints, which highlight that the function does not account for an empty input list. Consequently, if the function were to be called with an empty list, it would not meet the problem's requirements. 

For example, calling `func_1([])` would lead to an output of `0`, though the intended behavior for an empty input should ideally be defined (either returning an error or a specific value). Therefore, the code fails the correctness criterion in this scenario.
