The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the list `rounded_numbers`. The variable `rounded_numbers` remains a list of rounded values of `numbers`, and `numbers` also remains a list of real numbers. Since `total_sum` calculates the sum of `rounded_numbers`, its value is the sum of all the elements in that list. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`numbers` is a list of real numbers, `rounded_numbers` is a list of rounded values of `numbers`, `total_sum` is the sum of `rounded_numbers`.**
