Final: **False**. 

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` does not handle the case of an empty list input. This leads to a potential ZeroDivisionError when calculating the final result since it would attempt to multiply the sum by the length of the list, which would be zero. Thus, according to the problem description, the implementation is flawed because it does not properly account for potential input scenarios.
