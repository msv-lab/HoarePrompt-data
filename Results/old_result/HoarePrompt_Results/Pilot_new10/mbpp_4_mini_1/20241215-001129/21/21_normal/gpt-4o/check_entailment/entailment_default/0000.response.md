Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic to find the minimum number in a list using the `min()` function. However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle the edge case of an empty list. When the input list `lst` is empty, the `min()` function will raise a `ValueError`, which is not desired behavior as per the problem description, which implicitly assumes that input will be valid. Therefore, since the function fails to handle the case of an empty list appropriately, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
