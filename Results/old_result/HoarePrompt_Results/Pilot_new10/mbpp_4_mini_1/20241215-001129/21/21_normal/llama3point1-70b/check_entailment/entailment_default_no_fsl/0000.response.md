Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input list `nums` is empty. According to the output hints, using the `min` function on an empty list will raise a ValueError. This behavior does not align with the problem description, which implies that the function should find the smallest number in a given list. Since the function fails in the specific scenario of receiving an empty list as input, it does not meet the requirements for correctness in all potential cases.
