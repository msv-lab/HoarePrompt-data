Correctness: **False**

The provided program correctly finds the smallest number in a non-empty list. However, it fails to handle the edge case of an empty list. The `min()` function raises a `ValueError` when called on an empty list, which contradicts the problem description that does not specify handling for this case. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, leading to an incorrect verification.
