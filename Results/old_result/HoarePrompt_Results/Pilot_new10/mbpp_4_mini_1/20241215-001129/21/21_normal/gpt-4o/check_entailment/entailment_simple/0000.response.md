Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirement to find the smallest number in a list as described in the problem description. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

- The function `func_1(lst)` takes a list `lst` as input, which is expected to contain numbers. 
- Inside the function, it uses the built-in `min()` function to find the minimum value within the list. The `min()` function is well-defined for lists of numeric values and will return the smallest element.
- The assertions provided demonstrate that the function returns the correct minimum value for various test cases, confirming its correctness across different scenarios.

The function handles typical input cases for lists of numbers, and since it relies on Python's built-in functionality to find the minimum value, it is robust and efficient for this purpose. Thus, it adheres to the problem description as required.
