Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple as inputs and returns a new list that is the result of concatenating the original list with the elements of the tuple. The program adheres to the problem description, as it successfully adds the elements of the tuple to the given list in all potential cases. 

Here are the justifications for its correctness:

1. If `input_list` is empty and `input_tuple` contains elements, the function correctly returns a list containing only the elements of the tuple.
2. If `input_list` contains elements and `input_tuple` is empty, the function correctly returns the original list.
3. If both `input_list` and `input_tuple` contain elements, the function correctly appends the elements of the tuple to the list.
4. The function is able to handle various cases of data types as long as they are compatible with lists, without any type-related issues.

Since no edge cases or potential failures arise from this implementation, it fulfills the requirements as specified in the problem description.
