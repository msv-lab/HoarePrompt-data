Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` takes a list (`lst`) and a tuple (`tpl`) as input and returns a new list that combines the elements of the original list with the elements of the tuple by converting the tuple into a list. 

Upon testing:

- The function is tested with assertions, such as `func_1([5, 6, 7], (9, 10))`, and returns `[5, 6, 7, 9, 10]`, which is the expected output.
- The same applies to the other assertions provided, and all of them give the expected outputs as per the problem description.

The function correctly adds the elements from the tuple to the list in all tested cases. There are no edge cases indicated in the problem description that the function does not handle. 

Therefore, the implementation performs correctly for the specified problem requirements.
