Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to add the elements from a given tuple to a list as specified in the problem description. The annotated version of the code confirms that `lst` is the list and `tpl` is the tuple, with the function returning a new list that is the concatenation of the original list and the elements of the tuple converted to a list. All provided assertions demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for valid inputs. Therefore, the implementation fulfills the problem requirements correctly, and the original assessment of correctness remains valid.
