Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement of adding a tuple to a list by converting the tuple to a list and concatenating it with the input list. The annotations confirm that before the function call, the inputs are valid (i.e., `input_list` is a list and `input_tuple` is a tuple), which aligns with the assumptions made about the inputs. The function handles all potential edge cases as described in the original assessment, such as empty lists and tuples, consistently producing the expected results. Thus, the program meets the criteria set forth in the problem description.
