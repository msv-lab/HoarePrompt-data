Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl` converted to a list. There are no edge cases or missing logic in this implementation; it correctly handles empty lists and tuples as well, resulting in the appropriate concatenated output.**
