Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to add the elements of a tuple to the end of a list. The provided test cases confirm that the function produces the expected output for various inputs. Additionally, the output hints suggest that the function properly handles edge cases, including empty lists and tuples. As the assessment concludes, there are no missing logic or edge cases that would affect the correctness given the assumption of valid input. The implementation adheres to the problem's requirements.
