Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly fulfill the requirements of the problem description. The main issue is that the problem specifies the need to "add the given tuple to the given list," which implies modifying the list in place by adding the elements of the tuple to it. However, the provided function `func_1` does not alter the input list (`input_list`); instead, it creates and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `input_list` and the elements of `input_tuple` converted to a list. 

Thus, it does not meet the requirement to add (or append) the tuple to the list as per the problem description. The requirements suggest that the contents of the list should be changed to reflect the addition of the tuple elements, which is not achieved with the current implementation. 

An appropriate way to align with the problem description would be to modify `input_list` directly, using methods such as `list.extend()` or `list.append()`, which are meant for in-place operations on lists.
