You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to find the last position of an element in a sorted array.
Program:
```
def func_1(arr, target):
    for i in range(len(arr) - 1, -1, -1):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to find the last position of a target element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array from the end to the beginning and returns the index of the last occurrence of the target. If the target is not found, the function returns -1.

The logic comprehensively handles the following scenarios:
1. If the target exists multiple times in the array, the program correctly returns the index of the last occurrence.
2. If the target exists only once, it returns the index of that element.
3. If the target does not exist at all in the array, it correctly returns -1.

Since the function satisfies all potential input cases as described in the problem statement, it is considered correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, which is expected to be sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer `target`. It searches for the last occurrence of `target` in `arr` and returns its index. If `target` is not found, the function returns -1. The function does not handle any exceptions or edge cases where `arr` might be empty. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
