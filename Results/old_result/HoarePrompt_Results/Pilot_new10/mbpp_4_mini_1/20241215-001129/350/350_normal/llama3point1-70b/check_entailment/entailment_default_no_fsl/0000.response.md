Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input list `arr` is empty. According to the problem description, the function should return -1 if the `target` is not found. However, if `arr` is empty, the function will also return -1, which is the expected behavior, but the hints mention that the function does not handle this edge case. Thus, the logic does not explicitly account for the requirement that it should function correctly for all potential cases, including the case of an empty input array. 

Additionally, the problem description does not specify that `arr` is guaranteed to be non-empty, so the failure to handle an empty array could be viewed as a missing logic case. Therefore, since there exists at least one potential case (an empty array) that the program does not handle correctly, it is incorrect.
