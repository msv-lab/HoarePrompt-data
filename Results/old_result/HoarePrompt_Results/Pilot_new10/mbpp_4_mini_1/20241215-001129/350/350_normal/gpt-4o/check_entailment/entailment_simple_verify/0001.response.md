Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` successfully identifies the last position of an element in a sorted array. The function properly iterates backward through the array, returning the correct index of the last occurrence of the specified element. The annotated version of the code confirms the correctness of the function's behavior at various states, particularly noting that if the element is not found, it correctly returns `-1`. Additionally, the edge cases reviewed in the original assessment indicated that the function behaves as expected in all analyzed scenarios. Thus, everything aligns with the problem description, supporting that the assessment of correctness was valid.
