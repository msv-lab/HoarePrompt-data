Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `arr`, which is expected to be sorted in non-decreasing order, and an integer `target`. It searches for the last occurrence of `target` in `arr` and returns its index. If `target` is not found, the function returns -1. The function does not handle any exceptions or edge cases where `arr` might be empty.**
