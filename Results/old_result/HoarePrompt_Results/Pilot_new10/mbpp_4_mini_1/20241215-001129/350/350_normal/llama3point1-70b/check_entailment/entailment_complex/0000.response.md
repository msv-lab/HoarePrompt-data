Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description according to the specific need of finding the last position of an element in a sorted array. 

While the function `func_1` correctly identifies the last occurrence of the element, it only returns the index if the element is found. If the element is not found in the array, it returns `-1`. However, this does not directly adhere to the way the problem statement describes the output, which implies that the function should be able to handle various scenarios, potentially including cases where the element is not present, but it doesnâ€™t clarify that returning `-1` is an acceptable outcome for indicating the absence.

Additionally, the comments indicate that the program does not handle any exceptions or edge cases, such as when the input array is empty. An empty array would lead to a `return -1`, but the comments indicate this return value is solely for the case when `target` is not found. There is also no clarity if the output needs to be in certain bounds (for example, returning None for an empty list instead of -1). Thus, the absence of explicit handling for edge cases (like when `arr` is empty) and unclear output handling implies that the function does not fully meet the expectations set by the problem description.

Therefore, the function may fail to provide correct results for certain edge cases, indicating that it is not entirely correct according to the problem description.
