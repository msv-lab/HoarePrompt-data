The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `target`. The parameter `arr` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and the parameter `target` is an integer. Based on the conditions specified, the function may return different values: 

- Case 1: If `arr` contains elements and the last element is equal to `target`, it returns the index of the last element, which is `len(arr) - 1`.
- Case 2: If the second last element in `arr` is equal to `target`, it returns the index of the second last element, which is `len(arr) - 2`. This case can only occur if `arr` has at least 1 element.
- Case 3: If the target is equal to the third last element in `arr`, it returns the index of the third last element, which is `len(arr) - 3`.
- Case 4: If none of the above cases hold true, it returns -1, indicating that the `target` integer is not found in the sorted list of integers `arr`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a sorted list of integers `arr` and an integer `target`, returning the index of the target in specific cases or -1 if the target is not found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter arr (a sorted list of integers) and a parameter target (an integer). It returns the index of target in specific cases, or -1 if target is not found in the list.**
