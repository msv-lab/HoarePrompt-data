The provided function `func_1` is designed to find the last position of an element in a sorted array. The code iterates backward through the array and returns the index of the first occurrence of the element `x` when found. If `x` is not present, it returns -1.

Let's analyze the output hints provided:

1. The function returns the index of `x` in `arr` if it exists.
2. If `x` is not found, the function returns -1.
3. The function searches from the end of the list to the beginning.
4. It also handles cases where `arr` is empty or `x` is not present.

The assertion cases provided:
- For the input `([1, 2, 3], 1)`, it correctly returns `0`, as `1` is at index `0`.
- For the input `([1, 1, 1, 2, 3, 4], 1)`, it correctly returns `2`, as the last occurrence of `1` is at index `2`.
- For the input `([2, 2, 3, 3, 6, 8, 9], 3)`, it correctly returns `3`, which is the last occurrence of `3`.

These assertions indicate that the function performs correctly for these cases.

Now, let's examine potential edge cases:
- If the input array is empty, `func_1([], 1)` should return `-1`, which it does.
- If the element is not present in the array (e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 3], 4)`), it should return `-1`, which it will also handle correctly.
- If there are multiple occurrences of `x`, it will correctly return the index of the last occurrence, as noted in the assertions.

Since all provided examples and hints confirm that the function behaves as expected, covering various situations, we can conclude that the function correctly adheres to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function effectively finds the last position of an element in a sorted array for all potential cases, including handling of empty arrays and the absence of the searched element.
