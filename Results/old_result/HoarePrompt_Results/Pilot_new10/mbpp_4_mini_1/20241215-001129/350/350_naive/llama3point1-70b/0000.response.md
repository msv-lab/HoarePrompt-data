Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements a function to find the last position of a target element in a sorted array. It iterates through the array in reverse (from the end to the beginning) and checks if the current element matches the target. If it finds a match, it immediately returns the index of that element. If no match is found after examining all elements, it returns -1. 

This implementation covers all edge cases: 
- If the array is empty, it returns -1 appropriately.
- If the element does not exist in the array, it returns -1.
- If the target is the last element in the array, it correctly returns the last index.
- If the target occurs multiple times, it returns the last occurrence correctly.

Thus, the function meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
