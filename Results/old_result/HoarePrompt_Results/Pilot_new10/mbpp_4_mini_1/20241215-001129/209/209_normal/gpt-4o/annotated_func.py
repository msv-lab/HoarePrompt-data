#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of lists.
def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]
    #The program returns a list containing the first elements of each sublist from the list of lists 'lst'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of lists `lst` and returns a list containing the first elements of each sublist. If any sublist is empty, it will not contribute any element, effectively resulting in skipped entries, which means the output list length may be less than the number of sublists in `lst`.
