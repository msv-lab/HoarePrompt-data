You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
Program:
```
assert func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6, 7, 8, 9]]) == [1, 3, 6]
assert func_1([[1, 2, 3], [4, 5]]) == [1, 4]
assert func_1([[9, 8, 1], [1, 2]]) == [9, 1]

def func_1(lst):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in lst]


```
Original Assessment: To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to assess if `func_1` handles all potential cases, including edge cases.

The function `func_1` is designed to return the first element of each sublist from a given list of lists. The assertions provided check a few different cases, which include:

1. Lists of varying lengths.
2. Lists containing multiple elements in sublists.

### Potential Edge Cases:

1. **Empty sublists**: If one of the sublists is empty (e.g., `func_1([[], [1, 2]])`), the function will throw an `IndexError` because it attempts to access the first element of an empty list.

2. **Empty input list**: If the input list itself is empty (e.g., `func_1([])`), the function will return an empty list which might be an acceptable scenario based on the problem description but is not handled in the original assertions.

3. **Mixed type elements**: Although the problem does not specify the types of elements in the sublists, if some sublists contain non-list items or are of different types (e.g., `func_1([[1, 2], 'not a list'])`), this could lead to incorrect behavior since the function expects sublists.

### Example of failure:
- Calling `func_1([[], [1, 2]])` results in:
  ```python
  IndexError: list index out of range
  ```

### Conclusion:
Due to the possibility of encountering an `IndexError` with empty sublists, the program does not correctly handle all potential input scenarios as described. 

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of lists `lst` and returns a list containing the first elements of each sublist. If any sublist is empty, it will not contribute any element, effectively resulting in skipped entries, which means the output list length may be less than the number of sublists in `lst`. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
