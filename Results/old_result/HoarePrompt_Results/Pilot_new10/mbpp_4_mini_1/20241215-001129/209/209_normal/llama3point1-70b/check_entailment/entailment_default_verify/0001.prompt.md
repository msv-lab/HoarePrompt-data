You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.
Program:
```
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]


```
Original Assessment: To verify the program, I will analyze the provided function `func_1` against the problem description, which is to get the first element of each sublist from a given list of sublists.

The function `func_1` is defined as:

```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

### Potential Cases to Consider:
1. **Empty List of Sublists**: 
    - Input: `[]`
    - Expected Output: `[]` (returns an empty list as there are no sublists)
    - Actual Output: `[]`  (matches)

2. **Sublists with Various Lengths**: 
    - Input: `[[1, 2], [3, 4], [5]]`
    - Expected Output: `[1, 3, 5]`
    - Actual Output: `[1, 3, 5]`  (matches)

3. **Sublists with Single Element**:
    - Input: `[[42], [23], [17]]`
    - Expected Output: `[42, 23, 17]`
    - Actual Output: `[42, 23, 17]`  (matches)

4. **Sublists with Empty Sublists**:
    - Input: `[[1, 2], [], [5]]`
    - Expected Output: `[1, 5]` (the second sublist is empty and should not return anything)
    - Actual Output: This will raise an `IndexError` because trying to access the element `0` of an empty sublist will fail.

### Conclusion:
The last test case demonstrates that the function does not handle the scenario where any of the sublists is empty, leading to an `IndexError`. Since the program fails to meet the requirements in every potential case due to this oversight, the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of lists called `sublists` and returns a new list containing the first element of each sublist. If any sublist is empty, it will cause an IndexError, but this case is not handled in the code. Therefore, the function assumes that all sublists contain at least one element; otherwise, an error will occur. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
