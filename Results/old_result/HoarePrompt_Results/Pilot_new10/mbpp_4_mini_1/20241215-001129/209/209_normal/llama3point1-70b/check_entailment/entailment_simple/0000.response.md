Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to extract the first element from each sublist within the provided list of lists, as specified in the problem description. 

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The function takes a parameter `sublists`, which is described as a list of lists. This aligns with the expected input.

2. **List Comprehension**: The syntax `[sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]` efficiently iterates through each sublist in `sublists` and retrieves the first element (`sublist[0]`) from each.

3. **Output**: The function returns a new list containing only the first elements of each sublist, which matches the task stated in the problem description.

4. **Assumptions**: The implementation assumes that each sublist has at least one element. If a sublist were to be empty, it would raise an `IndexError`. However, since the problem does not specify the possibility of empty sublists, we consider it valid under typical use cases where the function would be applied.

Overall, the program satisfies the criteria set forth by the problem description.
