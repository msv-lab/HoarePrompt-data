Explanation: The provided program aims to return the first element of each sublist in the given list of lists `sublists`. However, the function does not handle cases where any of the sublists might be empty. According to the output hints, if any sublist is empty, it will raise an `IndexError`. Therefore, the function is not robust and does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically when empty sublists are involved.

Correctness: **False**.
