To determine if the provided program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description, we will evaluate the code with various potential inputs.

### Problem Description:
Write a python function to get the first element of each sublist.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(sublists):
    return [sublist[0] for sublist in sublists]
```

### Evaluation of the Program:

1. **Normal Case:** If the input is a list of lists with non-empty sublists:
   - Input: `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6], [7, 8]]`
   - Output: `[1, 4, 7]`
   - This works as expected.

2. **Empty Sublists:** If the input lists have empty sublists:
   - Input: `[[1, 2], [], [3, 4]]`
   - The code will raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `sublist[0]` for the empty sublist.
   - This is a potential failure case as it does not handle empty sublists.

3. **All Sublists Empty:** If the input is entirely empty:
   - Input: `[[]]`
   - The code will again raise an `IndexError` when accessing the first element.

4. **No Sublists:** If the input is an empty list:
   - Input: `[]`
   - The output would be `[]`, which is correct as there are no sublists.

### Conclusion:
The function does not account for cases where the sublists might be empty, leading to an `IndexError`. Thus, it does not meet the requirements in all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**.
