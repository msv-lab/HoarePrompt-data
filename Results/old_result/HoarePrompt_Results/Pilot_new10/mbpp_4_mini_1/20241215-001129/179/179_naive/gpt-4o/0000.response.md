Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` calculates the cube sum of the first `n` even natural numbers; however, it does not account for cases where `n` is less than 1. For example, if we call `func_1(0)`, the function will return `0`, since there are no even numbers to consider, and `sum` of an empty list is `0`. The problem statement does not specify how to handle non-positive integers (including `0`), and it implies that we should be computing for the "first n even natural numbers," which suggests that `n` should start from `1`. 

So, `func_1(0)` should ideally raise an error or handle the input differently, rather than returning `0`, which is not fulfilling the problem's requirement properly. 

Thus, because the function does not work correctly for all possible cases, we conclude that the correctness is **False**.
