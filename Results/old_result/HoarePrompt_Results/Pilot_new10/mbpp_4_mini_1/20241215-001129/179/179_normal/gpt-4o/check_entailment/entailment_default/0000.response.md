To analyze the given program and determine its correctness, let's begin with the problem description and the provided code.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that calculates the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

### Given Program
```python
assert func_1(2) == 72
assert func_1(3) == 288
assert func_1(4) == 800

def func_1(n):
    even_numbers = [2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]
    cube_sum = sum((x ** 3 for x in even_numbers))
    return cube_sum
```

### Output Hints
The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the sum of the cubes of all even numbers from 2 to 2*n. It does not handle the case of `n` being negative since `n` is specified as a non-negative integer, which means no additional error handling is necessary. The function computes `even_numbers` as a list of first `n` even numbers and sums their cubes.

### Code Functionality Review
1. **Input Handling**: The function assumes the input is a non-negative integer which follows the problem statement; however, it does not explicitly validate or check for this condition within the function (though this isn't strictly necessary given the description).
2. **Calculation**:
   - It generates the first `n` even natural numbers using the expression `[2 * i for i in range(1, n + 1)]`. This generates a list of `[2, 4, 6, ..., 2*n]`.
   - It calculates the cube of each of these numbers and sums them up.
3. **Function Output**:
   - For `func_1(2)`, even numbers are [2, 4], and `2^3 + 4^3 = 8 + 64 = 72`.
   - For `func_1(3)`, even numbers are [2, 4, 6], and `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 = 288`.
   - For `func_1(4)`, even numbers are [2, 4, 6, 8], and `2^3 + 4^3 + 6^3 + 8^3 = 8 + 64 + 216 + 512 = 800`.

### Conclusion
The output hints agree with the calculations performed in the code. For every case outlined in the problem description, the program outputs the expected results as described.

Since no edge cases or unexpected input conditions are provided that would cause the function to behave incorrectly based on the given hints, and all specified cases produce the correct results, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**.
