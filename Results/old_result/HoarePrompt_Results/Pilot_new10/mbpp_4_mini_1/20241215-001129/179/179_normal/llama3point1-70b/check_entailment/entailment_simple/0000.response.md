Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Understanding of Even Natural Numbers**: The first n even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., up to 2n. 

2. **Range Function**: The `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` in the program generates the sequence of the first n even natural numbers. 
   - The `start` is 2, ensuring that we begin with the first even natural number.
   - The `stop` is `n * 2 + 1`, which effectively includes the last even natural number in the series, which is 2n (since `range` is exclusive at the end).
   - The `step` is 2, which ensures that only even numbers are selected.

3. **Summation of Cubes**: The program computes the cube of each of these even numbers using `i ** 3` and sums them up using the `sum` function. This aligns perfectly with the problem requirement of finding the cube sum.

4. **Inclusivity**: The program includes all even natural numbers from 2 to 2n, ensuring that it meets the requirement for any non-negative integer n.

Therefore, the program does indeed fulfill the problem description's requirements accurately for all potential cases.
