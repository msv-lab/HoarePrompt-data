The annotated program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description.

The problem description states that the task is to find the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers. The even natural numbers are 2, 4, 6, ..., up to the nth even number, which is 2n. 

The function `func_1(n)` computes the sum of the cubes of all even integers from 2 to 2n inclusive. Specifically, the range `range(2, n * 2 + 1, 2)` generates the even numbers starting from 2 up to 2n. 

Here is how the program aligns with the problem description:

1. The function iterates over even integers from 2 to 2n inclusive (by generating numbers with a step of 2).
2. For each even integer in this range, it calculates its cube (`i ** 3`).
3. Finally, it sums these cubes using the `sum` function.

There are no edge cases unhandled, as the problem description specifies that n is a non-negative integer. The program effectively handles this within its logic.

Thus, the function satisfies the problem requirements of finding the cube sum of the first n even natural numbers.

Correctness: **True**
