The variable `max_list` is assigned the value of `sublist`. Since it is stated that `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, this implies that at this point, `max_list` will contain the elements of the `sublist`, which is derived from `list_of_lists`. The values of `max_sum` and `current_sum` remain unchanged. The `max_list` variable is now updated to reflect this assignment. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`**.
