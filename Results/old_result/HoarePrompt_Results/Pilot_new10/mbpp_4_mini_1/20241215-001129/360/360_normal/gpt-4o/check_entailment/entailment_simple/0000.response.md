Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why the function `func_1` is correct:

1. **Function Purpose**: The function is designed to take a list of lists and return the specific sublist where the sum of its elements is the highest.

2. **Logic Implementation**:
   - It initializes `max_sum` to negative infinity and `max_list` to an empty list, which allows it to correctly handle cases where the input list may be empty or have negative sums.
   - It iterates through each sublist in `list_of_lists`, calculates the sum of the current sublist, and compares it to the current `max_sum`.
   - If the sum of the current sublist exceeds `max_sum`, it updates `max_sum` with this new sum and assigns `max_list` to the current sublist.

3. **Correctness of Outputs**: 
   - The function is tested against several assertions that check various scenarios:
     - The first assertion checks a list with mixed sums, and the function correctly identifies `[10, 11, 12]` as having the highest sum of `33`.
     - The second assertion tests another scenario and yields the expected result of `[12, 11, 10]`. 
     - The last assertion verifies the behavior when there is only one sublist, ensuring it returns that sublist.
   
4. **No Missing Cases**: 
   - The function will correctly return an empty list if `list_of_lists` is empty since `max_list` remains empty, which is an appropriate response in that case.

5. **Conclusion**: The program handles all specified inputs based on the problem description, returning the correct sublist corresponding to the highest sum. Thus, it always adheres to the requirements.
