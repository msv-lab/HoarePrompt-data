Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where the input list of lists is empty. According to the problem description, the function is expected to return a list in a list of lists whose sum of elements is the highest. However, if `lists` is empty, the call to `max()` raises a `ValueError` because it cannot operate on an empty sequence. Thus, the program fails for the input `[]`, demonstrating that it does not meet the requirements for every potential case described in the problem.
