The code initializes `max_list` as an empty list. The other variables, `list_of_lists` and `max_sum`, are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, `max_sum` remains float('-inf'), and `list_of_lists` stays a list of lists containing numerical values.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing numerical values; `max_sum` is assigned the value float('-inf'); `max_list` is an empty list.**
