According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list contains at least one sublist, the loop will execute. The `max_sum` is initialized to `float('-inf')`, which means it can be compared to the sums of the sublists that will be iterated over. The `max_list` being an empty list indicates it is ready to potentially hold a sublist that has the maximum sum once the loop begins.

For the loop to be executed:
- `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist.
- `sublist` will be assigned the first sublist in `list_of_lists` during the first iteration.

State: **`max_sum` is float('-inf'), `max_list` is an empty list, `list_of_lists` must have at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`**
