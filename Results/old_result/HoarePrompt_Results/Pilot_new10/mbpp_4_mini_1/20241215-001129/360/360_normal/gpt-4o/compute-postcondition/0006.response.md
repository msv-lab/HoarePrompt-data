The code sets `max_list` to `sublist`. Given that `max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, and that `current_sum` is greater than the previous `max_sum`, `max_list` now holds the elements of `sublist`, which implies that the maximum sum is now represented by `max_list`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is equal to `sublist`, `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`, and is greater than the previous `max_sum`.**
