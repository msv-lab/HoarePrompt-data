The value of `max_sum` is assigned the value of `current_sum`. The initial value of `max_sum` is the maximum sum seen so far, and `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`. The other variables, `max_list`, `sublist`, and their respective states remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`max_sum` is equal to `current_sum`, `max_list` is an empty list, `sublist` is the next sublist in `list_of_lists`, and `current_sum` is the sum of the elements in `sublist`.**
