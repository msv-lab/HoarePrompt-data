Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a dictionary `d` and filters its entries based on whether their values are greater than or equal to a given integer `n`. The code implements a dictionary comprehension that correctly constructs a new dictionary based on the filtering conditions outlined in the problem description. The assertions provided check specific cases:

1. For `n = 170`, it correctly returns only those entries where the values are `175`, `180`, and `190`.
2. For `n = 180`, it returns `180` and `190`.
3. For `n = 190`, it returns only `190`.

Additionally, the output hints accurately describe the expected behavior of the function, stating that if `d` is empty, it will return an empty dictionary. Given that the function performs as expected for all tested cases, including edge cases, we can conclude that the implementation meets the requirements specified in the problem description. Thus, the correctness is confirmed as True.
