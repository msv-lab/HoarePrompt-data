Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to filter the dictionary `d` based on the specified integer `n`. The annotations confirm that the function processes valid inputs as expected, returning a dictionary that contains only the entries with values greater than or equal to `n`. Furthermore, the examples and reasoning provided in the original assessment align with the behavior of the function as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the function meets the requirements and handles all expected scenarios.
