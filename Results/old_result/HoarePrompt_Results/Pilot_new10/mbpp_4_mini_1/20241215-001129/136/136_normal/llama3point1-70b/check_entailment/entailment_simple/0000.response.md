Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input Constraints**: The function `func_1(d, n)` takes in a dictionary `d` where the keys are of any hashable type and the values are integers, along with an integer `n`. This aligns with the problem statement.

2. **Filtering Logic**: The program uses a dictionary comprehension to filter the dictionary. It iterates over each key-value pair in `d` using `d.items()`, and it includes only those pairs where the value `v` is greater than or equal to `n`. This is exactly what the problem specifies â€“ to return a dictionary with entries that have values meeting or exceeding the threshold defined by `n`.

3. **Output**: The output is a new dictionary that only contains entries meeting the criteria, fulfilling the requirement stated in the problem description to "filter the dictionary."

Given these points, the program correctly addresses the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential input cases that meet the defined conditions.
