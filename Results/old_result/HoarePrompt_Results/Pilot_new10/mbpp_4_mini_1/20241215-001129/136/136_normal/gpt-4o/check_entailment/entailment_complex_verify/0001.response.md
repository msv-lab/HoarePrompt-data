Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic described in the problem, filtering the dictionary to include only those entries whose values are greater than or equal to the provided integer `n`. The annotated version confirms that the function behaves as expected, returning a new dictionary that upholds the required conditions. The assertions in the program verify its correctness with multiple test cases, all of which return the expected results. Moreover, the function is robust when handling empty dictionaries, as it will correctly return an empty dictionary when appropriate. Therefore, the function fulfills the problem requirements, and the original assessment is justified.
