Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(tup, lst)` correctly implements the requirement to count occurrences of all elements in the list `lst` as they appear in the tuple `tup`. The use of `tup.count(element)` for each `element` in `lst` successfully counts the occurrences, and the summation of those counts provides the correct total. 

The annotations confirm that the program evaluates as intended at each stage and explicitly states that if an element from `lst` is not found in `tup`, it contributes zero to the final count. 

Additionally, the edge cases mentioned (empty lists or elements not found) do not affect the program's correctness as the function handles these scenarios flawlessly by returning zero when appropriate. Therefore, the program satisfies all conditions laid out in the problem description.
