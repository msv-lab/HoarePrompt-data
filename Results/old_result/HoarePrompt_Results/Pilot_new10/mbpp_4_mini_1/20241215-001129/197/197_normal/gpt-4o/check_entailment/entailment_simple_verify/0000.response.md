Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly counts the occurrences of all specified elements from the given list in the provided tuple. The function `func_1` appears to handle the requirements effectively, and the annotated version reinforces the idea that the inputs are valid. The test cases provided demonstrate that the program produces the expected results for the given inputs, confirming its correctness according to the problem description. The state of the program before the function call aligns with the expected input types, and the function's output accurately reflects the summation of occurrences as intended.
