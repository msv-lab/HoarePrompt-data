#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and lst is a list.
def func_1(tup, lst):
    return sum(tup.count(element) for element in lst)
    #The program returns the sum of the counts of each element in 'lst' found in the tuple 'tup'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list `lst`, and returns the total count of how many times each element in `lst` appears in `tup`. If an element from `lst` is not found in `tup`, it contributes a count of zero to the sum.
