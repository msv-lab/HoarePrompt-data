Correctness: **True**

The provided program counts the occurrences of each element in a list (`lst`) within a tuple (`tup`) and sums these counts. The implementation uses a generator expression that iterates over each element in the list, counts its occurrences in the tuple using the `count()` method, and then sums these counts.

The behavior described in the problem aligns with the output hints, which state that if an element from `lst` is not found in `tup`, it contributes a count of zero to the total. The function correctly accounts for this by using the count method, which returns zero when an element is not present.

For instance, calling the function with:
```python
func_1((1, 2, 2, 3), [2, 3, 4])
```
would yield a correct count of 3, since `2` appears twice, `3` appears once, and `4` does not appear, contributing zero.

Since the code adheres to the problem description and handles all potential cases (including when elements in the list are absent from the tuple), I can confidently conclude that the implementation is correct.

In summary, the code efficiently meets the problem's requirements, hence Correctness: **True**.
