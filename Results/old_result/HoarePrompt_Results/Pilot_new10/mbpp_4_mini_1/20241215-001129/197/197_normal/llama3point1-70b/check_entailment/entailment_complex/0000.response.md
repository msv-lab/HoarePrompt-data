Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it accurately implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Here's why it aligns with the specified functionality:

1. **Inputs**: The function `func_1` takes two parameters: `tup` (a tuple) and `lst` (a list). This matches the requirement to count the occurrences of list elements in a tuple.

2. **Counting Occurrences**: The function utilizes a generator expression `tup.count(element) for element in lst` to count how many times each element from the list `lst` appears in the tuple `tup`. This directly fulfills the requirement of counting occurrences of each element from the list in the tuple.

3. **Summing Counts**: The `sum(...)` function aggregates these individual counts, producing the total count of occurrences across all elements in the list. This means that every element in the list is accounted for, even if its count is zero (i.e., when the element is not found in the tuple).

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the total count, which is precisely what the problem description asks for: to count the occurrence of all elements of the list in the tuple.

Given this analysis, the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Any element from the list not found in the tuple is correctly counted as zero, thus ensuring accurate results.
