#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple and elements is a list of elements.
def func_1(tup, elements):
    count = sum(tup.count(element) for element in elements)
    return count
    #The program returns the total occurrences of elements from 'elements' in the tuple 'tup'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a list of `elements`, and returns the count of how many times elements from the list appear in the tuple. If an element in `elements` is not found in `tup`, it does not contribute to the count, leading to a total count based solely on the occurrences of the elements in the tuple.
