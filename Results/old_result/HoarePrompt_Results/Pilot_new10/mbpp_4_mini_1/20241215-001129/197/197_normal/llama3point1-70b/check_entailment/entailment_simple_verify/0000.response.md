Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1(tup, lst)` correctly implements the requirement to count the occurrences of all elements from the list `lst` in the tuple `tup`. The use of the `count` method on the tuple is appropriate and effectively counts occurrences for each element in the list. 

As stated in the problem description, the function will return 0 for an empty list, which is the expected behavior, and the function correctly sums the counts of all elements in `lst` that may or may not exist in `tup`. The annotated version of the code reinforces that it correctly computes the sum of counts, further validating the correctness of the original assessment. Additionally, since valid input is assumed, edge cases related to input validation do not impact the correctness evaluation. Overall, the function meets the specified requirements, confirming the original assessment.
