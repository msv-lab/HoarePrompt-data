Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(tup, lst)` correctly counts the occurrences of all elements from the list `lst` in the tuple `tup`. It does this by iterating through each element in `lst` and using the `count` method on the tuple `tup`. The result is the sum of all occurrences for each element, which matches the requirement stated in the problem description. 

There are no edge cases that can break the functionality since:
- An empty list will return 0, as there are no elements to count.
- A list with elements that do not exist in the tuple will also return 0.
- The function handles tuples of varying sizes appropriately.

Thus, the code handles all potential cases as described, confirming its correctness.
