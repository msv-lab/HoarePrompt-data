Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate in identifying that the function does not generate the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers correctly. The function appears to generate a sequence based on the recurrence relation derived from the Fibonacci series but does not align with the specification of generating the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. 

Even with the annotations provided, they confirm that the function does not correctly implement the required logic to produce the correct prime numbers. The example of `func_1(6)` that should return 103 further emphasizes the inaccuracy of the program's output relative to the defined task. Hence, the conclusion remains that the program is incorrect as per the problem description.
