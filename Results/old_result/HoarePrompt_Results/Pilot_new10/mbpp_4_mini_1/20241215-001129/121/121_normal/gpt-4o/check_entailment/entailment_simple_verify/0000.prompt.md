You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    (S0, S1) = (1, 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        (S0, S1) = (S1, S_next)
    return S1


```
Original Assessment: The provided program appears to define a function that computes values based on a recurrence relation, generally associated with the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes which should return the nth prime in that sequence.

However, the initial assertions in the program seem to imply that the function is expected to return specific prime numbers. Upon examining the function `func_1`, it calculates the sequence using the recurrence relation but does not seem to implement any logic to filter out non-prime numbers or to identify specifically the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

For example:
- `func_1(3)` returns `7`, which is correct.
- `func_1(4)` returns `17`, which is also correct.
- `func_1(5)` returns `41`, which is correct too.

However, if we consider the fourth term of the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, which should ideally be `41`, we find that the implementation doesn't seem to filter these numbers or account for any non-prime outputs. The function does not check whether the computed values `S_next` are indeed prime nor does it ensure that it accounts for the sequence of primes to determine the nth prime number.

The primary issue is that the function, despite matching the given output for specific examples, does not guarantee correctness for general cases of finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number or handling inputs beyond the provided examples. Thus, based on the problem description requiring it to find the nth prime specifically, and not just producing a value based on prior primes, this is insufficient.

Because the function logic does not align fully with the problem statement about finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime, there could easily be a scenario where the program fails or returns numbers that are not prime or not the correct nth prime, hence:

Correctness: **False**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0 or n == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the value 1 regardless of the current value of n, which is either 0 or 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is greater than 1
    S0, S1 = 1, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        
        S0, S1 = S1, S_next
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `S0` is the value of `S1` after the last iteration, `S1` is the value of the last computed `S_next`, representing the sequence terms.
    return S1
    #The program returns S1, which is the value of the last computed S_next, representing the sequence terms.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
