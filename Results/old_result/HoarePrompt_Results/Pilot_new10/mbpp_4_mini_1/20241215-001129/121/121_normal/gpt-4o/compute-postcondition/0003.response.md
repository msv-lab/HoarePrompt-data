The code snippet initializes the variables `S0` and `S1` to the value of 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it was not affected by this statement. The initial conditions regarding `n` being a non-negative integer and greater than 1 are still valid. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1; `S0` is 1; `S1` is 1**
