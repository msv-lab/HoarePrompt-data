To analyze the output state after all iterations of the loop, we note that:
- The loop runs from `i = 2` to `i = n`, which means it will execute a total of `n - 1` times.
- For each iteration, `S_next` is calculated as `2 * S1 + S0`, and the values of `S0` and `S1` are updated accordingly for the next iteration.

Given the initial values:
- `S0` starts as 1,
- `S1` starts as 1.

We can derive the values step-by-step:

1. **After the loop executes 1 time**:
   - `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0 = 2 * 1 + 1 = 3`
   - New `S0` = old `S1` = 1, New `S1` = `S_next` = 3

2. **After the loop executes 2 times**:
   - `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0 = 2 * 3 + 1 = 7`
   - New `S0` = old `S1` = 3, New `S1` = `S_next` = 7

3. **After the loop executes 3 times**:
   - `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0 = 2 * 7 + 3 = 17`
   - New `S0` = old `S1` = 7, New `S1` = `S_next` = 17

Continuing this for all iterations until `n` would give us a series that can be calculated. After analyzing the pattern or through further iterations, we understand that:
- The final `S1` will represent the value after the full loop execution, which can be anticipated to eventually give us a value of `S1` as `2*S_previous + S_before_previous`.

If the loop runs completely from `i = 2` to `i = n`, we can conclude that after `n - 1` iterations:
- `S0` will be the value of `S1` before the last calculation,
- `S1` will be the next computed value,
- `S_next` will not need to be referenced after the final iteration.

Thus, when `n` is executed fully, we can summarize:
- `S0` would finalize at the last computed previous value of `S1`,
- `S1` would finalize at the value computed from the last iteration.

Considering all loop states, the final output state would be:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `S0` is the value of `S1` after the last iteration, `S1` is the value of the last computed `S_next`, representing the sequence terms.**
