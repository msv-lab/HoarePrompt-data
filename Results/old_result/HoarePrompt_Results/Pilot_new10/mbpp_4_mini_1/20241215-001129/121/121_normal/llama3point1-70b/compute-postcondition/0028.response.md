Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 2, and `num` is 9. If `num % 6` is either 1 or 5 and `count` equals `n`, the function returns `num`, which is 9. If `count` is not equal to `n`, the function returns None. If `num % 6` is neither 1 nor 5, no action is taken and the values remain unchanged.***
