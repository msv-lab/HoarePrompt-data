The variables `S0` and `S1` are assigned new values from `S1` and `S_next`, respectively. The previous values of `S0`, `S1`, and `S_next` are 3, 7, and 17. After the assignment, `S0` will take the value of `S1`, which is 7, and `S1` will take the value of `S_next`, which is 17. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unchanged at their initial values.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 4, `S0` is 7, `S1` is 17, `S_next` is 17**
