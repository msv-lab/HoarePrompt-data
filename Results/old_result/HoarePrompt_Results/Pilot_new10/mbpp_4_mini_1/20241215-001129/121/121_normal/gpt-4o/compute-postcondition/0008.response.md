In the provided code, `S_next` is assigned the value of `2 * S1 + S0`. The previous values are `S1` is 3 and `S0` is 1. Now we can calculate the new value of `S_next`:

- `S_next = 2 * 3 + 1 = 6 + 1 = 7`

The state of other variables remains unchanged. Thus, the updated values are as follows:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 (remains unchanged)
- `i` is 3 (remains unchanged)
- `S0` is 1 (remains unchanged)
- `S1` is 3 (remains unchanged)
- `S_next` is now 7

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `S0` is 1, `S1` is 3, `S_next` is 7**
