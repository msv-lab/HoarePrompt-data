`num` is incremented by 1, changing it from 8 to 9. The conditions regarding `func_1(num)` and the returns are not affected by this operation, and other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 2, and `num` is now 9.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `count` is 2, `num` is 9**
