The code `S0, S1 = S1, S_next` assigns the values of `S1` and `S_next` to `S0` and `S1` respectively. The previous values were `S0` = 1, `S1` = 3, and `S_next` = 7. After this assignment, `S0` becomes 3 (the previous value of `S1`) and `S1` becomes 7 (the value of `S_next`). 

The preconditions remain unchanged as the values of `n` and `i` are not directly affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `S0` is 3, `S1` is 7, `S_next` is 7**.
