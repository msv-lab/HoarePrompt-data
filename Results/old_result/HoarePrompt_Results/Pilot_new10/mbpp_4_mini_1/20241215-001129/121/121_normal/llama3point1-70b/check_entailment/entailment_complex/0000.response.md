Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully meet the problem description for finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number due to the following reasons:

1. The requirement to find "the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number" entails that there is a clearly defined set of such primes, specifically the sequence beginning with 7, then 11, 13, 17, etc.

2. The function `func_2` utilizes the `func_1` to check for primality and includes a condition to only increment the `count` when a prime is found that satisfies `num % 6 in [1, 5]`. This condition incorrectly implies that it is only considering primes of the form `6k Â± 1`, which is a common property of primes, but it does not guarantee that the generated sequence aligns with the actual Newman-Shanks-Williams prime sequence.

3. The innermost loop relies heavily on checking for primality without ensuring that while enumerating potential primes, they are all Newman-Shanks-Williams primes. The algorithm as it is currently written will miss certain Newman-Shanks-Williams primes because it may not correctly filter or generate primes in accordance with how Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are defined.

4. Moreover, there are no conditions or definitions in place to prevent infinite loops, particularly for cases where the number being checked doesn't fit into the appropriate prime categories or fails to return true through the primality test.

In summary, there isn't a guarantee that the output of `func_2` is valid for every input n, specifically when n > 1, as it could potentially yield incorrect or unexpected prime numbers that do not align with the expected sequence. Hence, the correctness of the program overall is rendered as false.
