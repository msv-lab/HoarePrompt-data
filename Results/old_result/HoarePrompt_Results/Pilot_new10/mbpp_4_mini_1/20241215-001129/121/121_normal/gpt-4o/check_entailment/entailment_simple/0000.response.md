To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to verify if the function `func_1` correctly returns the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

1. **Understanding the Definition**: The Newman–Shanks–Williams primes are a specific subset of prime numbers generated by a sequence defined as follows:
   - \( S_0 = 1, S_1 = 1 \)
   - For \( n \geq 2 \), \( S_n = 2 \cdot S_{n-1} + S_{n-2} \)

   The indexes corresponding to the first few Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers are:
   - \( S_0 = 1 \)
   - \( S_1 = 1 \)
   - \( S_2 = 3 \)
   - \( S_3 = 7 \)
   - \( S_4 = 17 \)
   - \( S_5 = 41 \)

   However, the terms `S_n` are indexed starting from `0`, while the assert statements in the code consider the first prime number to correspond to `n = 3`, which results in `7`.

2. **Reviewing the Implementation**:
   - The function starts correctly by checking `n == 0` and `n == 1`, returning `1` for both cases, which is indeed part of the generated sequence.
   - For `n >= 2`, it uses a loop to iteratively compute the next terms based on the previous two terms, which follows the defined sequence generation correctly.

3. **Evaluating the Assertions**:
   - The first assertion `func_1(3) == 7` is correct because the 3rd term (when we consider 0-indexing) is `7`.
   - The second assertion `func_1(4) == 17` is also correct since the 4th term (0-index) is `17`.
   - The third assertion `func_1(5) == 41` checks the value of the 5th term (0-index), which is indeed `41`.

4. **Conclusion**: Throughout all cases and based on the definitions provided, the function behaves as expected for the Newman–Shanks–Williams prime generation. The fact that they are included in the assertions confirms its alignment with the problem's requirements.

Thus, since `func_1` meets the stated requirements correctly, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
