Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The program description specifies that the function should find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number. However, the code provided only calculates the nth term of a sequence defined by a recurrence relation, which does not correspond to the actual sequence of Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers. The output hints clarify that the function does return the last term of a sequence; however, that does not align with the definition of the desired prime numbers. 

Additionally, the provided assert statements indicate known values for `func_1(3)`, `func_1(4)`, and `func_1(5)`, suggesting that these should return respective prime numbers in the sequence. The function, as it is written, will not produce the correct Newman–Shanks–Williams prime numbers for these inputs (the expected outputs are 7, 17, and 41, which match those provided, but these outputs do not necessarily occur in the intended sequence). Thus, the assertions do not necessarily confirm the correctness of the program's implementation relative to the problem statement. 

For values of `n` beyond those tested, the function may not return the correct prime numbers as it lacks logic to filter or compute prime values specifically. Therefore, since the code does not correctly implement the required functionality for all potential cases, it is incorrect.
