You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

def func_1(n):
    if n == 0 or n == 1:
        return 1
    (S0, S1) = (1, 1)
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        (S0, S1) = (S1, S_next)
    return S1


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to find the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, but it does not implement that logic. Instead, it appears to generate a sequence that is not related to the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes.

For example:
- The assertion `assert func_1(3) == 7` is correct since the output is 7.
- However, for `func_1(6)`, it produces 41, but the 6th Newman–Shanks–Williams prime should be 103. The function doesn't correctly generate the appropriate prime numbers as specified in the problem statement.

Thus, there are values of `n` for which the function does not produce the correct Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, resulting in the conclusion that the program is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(3) == 7
assert func_1(4) == 17
assert func_1(5) == 41

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    if (n == 0 or n == 1) :
        return 1
        #The program returns the value 1 regardless of the current value of n, which is either 0 or 1.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer, and `n` is greater than 1
    S0, S1 = 1, 1
    for i in range(2, n + 1):
        S_next = 2 * S1 + S0
        
        S0, S1 = S1, S_next
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `S0` is the value of `S1` after the last iteration, `S1` is the value of the last computed `S_next`, representing the sequence terms.
    return S1
    #The program returns S1, which is the value of the last computed S_next, representing the sequence terms.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 1 if `n` is 0 or 1, and for values greater than 1, it returns the last term of a sequence defined by the recurrence relation `S_next = 2 * S1 + S0`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
