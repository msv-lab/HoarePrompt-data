According to the code, the `while` loop is a `while True` loop, which means it will continue to execute indefinitely without a terminating condition. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to the states for the loop to execute one more time. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `count` is 1; `num` is 8**
