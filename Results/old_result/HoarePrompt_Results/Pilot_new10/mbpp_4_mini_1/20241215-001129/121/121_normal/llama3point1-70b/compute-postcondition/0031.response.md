The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a positive integer representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find, with `n` being greater than or equal to 1. 

Based on the input `n`:

- If `n` is 1, the function returns the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number at position 1, which is 7.
- If `n` is greater than 1 and satisfies certain conditions, the function returns the value of `num`, which is 7.
- If a specific condition is met where `num` equals 8, then the function returns 8.
- If another condition is met such that `num` equals 9, then the function returns 9.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a positive integer `n` and return the corresponding Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number based on various defined cases. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, which is a positive integer. It returns 7 if n is 1, and may return either 7, 8, or 9 based on other conditions when n is greater than 1.**
