You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer, where n represents the number to be checked for primality and must be greater than or equal to 0.
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if (n < 2) :
        return False
        #The program returns False because n is a non-negative integer less than 2, which is not prime.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a non-negative integer, where `n` represents the number to be checked for primality and must be greater than or equal to 2.
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `int(n
    return True
    #The program returns True

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find, with n >= 1.
def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if (n == 1) :
        return 7
        #The program returns the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number at position 1, which is 7.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer representing the position of the Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number to find, with `n >= 1`. The value of `n` is greater than 1.
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        
        num += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1; `count` is 3; `num` is 11; if `func_1(num)` returns true for `num` values 8, 9, and 10, then `count` will have reached `n` once `num` becomes 11.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
