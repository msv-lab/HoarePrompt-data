You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the nth newman–shanks–williams prime number.
Program:
```
def func_1(n):
    """Check if a number is prime."""
    if n < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if n % i == 0:
            return False
    return True

def func_2(n):
    """Find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number."""
    if n == 1:
        return 7
    count = 1
    num = 7
    while True:
        if func_1(num):
            if num % 6 in [1, 5]:
                count += 1
                if count == n:
                    return num
        num += 1


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to examine whether it accurately finds the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number according to the problem description.

The Newman-Shanks-Williams primes are a specific category of prime numbers, defined as follows:

1. The prime numbers begin with 7 as the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.
2. Subsequent numbers must be prime and also must yield a remainder of 1 or 5 when divided by 6.

- The function `func_1(n)` checks if a number is prime.
- The function `func_2(n)` is intended to find the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number.

**Analysis of the Code:**

1. **func_1(n)**: This function is implemented correctly in terms of checking the primality of a number.

2. **func_2(n)**:
   - It correctly initializes the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime as 7.
   - It keeps a count of how many Newman-Shanks-Williams primes have been found.
   - It then checks each successive number to see if it is both prime and satisfies `num % 6 in [1, 5]`.

Now, we need to ensure that the program works for all potential cases. 

Let's consider the input `n = 1` and `n = 2`:
- For `n = 1`, it correctly returns 7, which is the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.
- For `n = 2`, it will find the next prime (which must also be of the form mentioned) and return 13, which is indeed the second Newman-Shanks-Williams prime.

In testing further:
- For `n = 3`, it will output 19 (correctly, since it is the third such prime).
- Continuing this way, we get the sequence: 7, 13, 19, 31, 37, etc.

However, to validate the function’s robustness, let’s explore potentially problematic inputs:
- Input `n = 0`: The program does not handle this case, which should ideally return an indication of an invalid request since the 0th prime doesn't exist.
- Input `n < 1`: The function does not handle negative inputs and will lead to an infinite loop because the exit condition is determined solely by counting found primes.

Given the analysis, we observe that the program does not account for edge cases such as invalid values of `n` (like 0 or negative integers), and could potentially lead to an infinite loop or unintended behavior.

Thus, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False**

This conclusion arises from the fact that the program lacks proper handling for edge cases, thus not satisfying its requirements across all potential inputs.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.

    if (n < 2) :

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
