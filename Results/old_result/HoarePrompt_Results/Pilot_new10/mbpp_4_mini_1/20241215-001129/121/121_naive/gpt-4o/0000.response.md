The provided program appears to define a function that computes values based on a recurrence relation, generally associated with the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes which should return the nth prime in that sequence.

However, the initial assertions in the program seem to imply that the function is expected to return specific prime numbers. Upon examining the function `func_1`, it calculates the sequence using the recurrence relation but does not seem to implement any logic to filter out non-prime numbers or to identify specifically the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number.

For example:
- `func_1(3)` returns `7`, which is correct.
- `func_1(4)` returns `17`, which is also correct.
- `func_1(5)` returns `41`, which is correct too.

However, if we consider the fourth term of the Newman–Shanks–Williams primes, which should ideally be `41`, we find that the implementation doesn't seem to filter these numbers or account for any non-prime outputs. The function does not check whether the computed values `S_next` are indeed prime nor does it ensure that it accounts for the sequence of primes to determine the nth prime number.

The primary issue is that the function, despite matching the given output for specific examples, does not guarantee correctness for general cases of finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number or handling inputs beyond the provided examples. Thus, based on the problem description requiring it to find the nth prime specifically, and not just producing a value based on prior primes, this is insufficient.

Because the function logic does not align fully with the problem statement about finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime, there could easily be a scenario where the program fails or returns numbers that are not prime or not the correct nth prime, hence:

Correctness: **False**.
