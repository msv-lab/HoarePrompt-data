To determine the correctness of the provided program for finding the nth Newman–Shanks–Williams prime number, let's analyze the code step-by-step based on the problem description.

The function `func_1(n)` checks if a number is prime. The logic seems correct; it returns `False` for numbers less than 2 and checks divisibility until the square root of `n`, which is standard practice for primality testing.

The function `func_2(n)` is tasked with finding the nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime number. According to the logic:

1. It correctly returns 7 for `n == 1`, as the first Newman-Shanks-Williams prime is known to be 7.
2. It uses a while loop to iterate through potential prime candidates starting from 7 and checks for primality using `func_1(n)`.
3. It also checks that the prime number is of the form 6k ± 1 (hence the check `num % 6 in [1, 5]`).
4. The counter `count` increments correctly when a prime number of the desired form is found, and it returns the number when the count matches `n`.

However, there's a potential issue with the program:

- The while loop continues indefinitely until the desired nth prime is found. If `n` is very large, this could take a significant amount of time without an upper limit on `num`. Although the implementation will eventually find the nth prime as it only requires checking numbers sequentially, there’s no built-in mechanism to handle edge cases, particularly for very large values of `n`.

Moreover, for values of `n` that are very large or values for which no valid nth Newman-Shanks-Williams prime exists (if such a case were to be proposed in the domain of numbers), the program would not return a result in a timely manner or would go beyond practical limits.

Thus, while the program works for small values of `n`, the lack of handling for larger values leads to potential cases where it may not perform as expected.

Correctness: **False**.
