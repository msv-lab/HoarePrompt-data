Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(month)` correctly checks whether a given month number corresponds to a month that has 31 days. The set `months_with_31_days` includes the month numbers (1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12) that indeed have 31 days. The function correctly returns `True` if the provided month is in this set and `False` otherwise.

The provided assertions test various month numbers:
- `func_1(5)` returns `True` (May has 31 days).
- `func_1(2)` returns `False` (February typically has 28 days).
- `func_1(6)` returns `False` (June has 30 days).
- `func_1(1)` returns `True` (January has 31 days).
- `func_1(12)` returns `True` (December has 31 days).
- `func_1(11)` returns `False` (November has 30 days).

All tests are passing, and there are no edge cases missing because the function takes into account only valid month numbers (1 - 12) based on the problem description. Therefore, the program behaves as expected for the provided inputs.
