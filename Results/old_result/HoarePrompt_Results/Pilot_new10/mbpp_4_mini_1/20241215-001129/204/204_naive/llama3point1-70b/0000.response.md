Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly identifies whether the given month number (from 1 to 12) has 31 days. The program utilizes a list `months_31_days` that contains the month numbers which have 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12). 

For any input month number `n`, the function checks if `n` is in this list. If it is, the function returns `True`, indicating that the month has 31 days; otherwise, it returns `False`. 

There are no edge cases or inputs within the valid month range (1 to 12) that the program fails to handle correctly. Therefore, the code meets the problem description accurately for all potential cases.
