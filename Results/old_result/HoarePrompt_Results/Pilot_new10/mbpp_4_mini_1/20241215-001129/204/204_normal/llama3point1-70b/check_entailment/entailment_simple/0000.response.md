Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the required functionality as per the problem description. The function `func_1(n)` takes an integer `n`, which represents a month number ranging from 1 to 12, and checks if it is in the predefined list `months_31_days`. This list contains the month numbers that have 31 days: January (1), March (3), May (5), July (7), August (8), October (10), and December (12).

The specific check `return n in months_31_days` accurately determines whether the month represented by `n` has 31 days by returning `True` if `n` is one of those months and `False` otherwise. Therefore, the function adheres strictly to the requirements laid out in the problem description, covering all possible valid values of `n` (from 1 to 12). Thus, the implementation is correct and fulfills the problem's requirements.
