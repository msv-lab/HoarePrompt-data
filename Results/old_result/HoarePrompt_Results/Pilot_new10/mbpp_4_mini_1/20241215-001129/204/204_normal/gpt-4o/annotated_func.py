#State of the program right berfore the function call: month is an integer between 1 and 12, inclusive.
def func_1(month):
    months_with_31_days = {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
    return month in months_with_31_days
    #The program returns True if the month is one of the months with 31 days, and False otherwise, where months_with_31_days is the set {1, 3, 5, 7, 8, 10, 12}
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `month` (expected to be between 1 and 12, inclusive) and returns `True` if `month` corresponds to a month with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December), and `False` otherwise. The function does not handle cases where `month` is outside the range of 1 to 12.
