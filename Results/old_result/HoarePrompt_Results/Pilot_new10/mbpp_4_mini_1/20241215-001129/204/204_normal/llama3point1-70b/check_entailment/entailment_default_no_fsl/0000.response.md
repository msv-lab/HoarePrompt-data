Correctness: **True**

The function correctly identifies whether a given month number corresponds to a month with 31 days. It checks if the integer `n` is within the list of months that have 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, December). According to the output hints and the problem description, it accurately returns `True` for these month numbers and `False` for all other months, including February and the months with 30 days (April, June, September, November).

Since it meets the requirements as specified in every case, the output is correct, and there are no edge cases that the function fails to handle. Thus, the correctness of the program is validated as **True**.
