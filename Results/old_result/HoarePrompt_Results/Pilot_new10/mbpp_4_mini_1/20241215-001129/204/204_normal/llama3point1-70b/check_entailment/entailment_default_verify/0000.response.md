Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. It successfully checks whether the given month number (1 through 12) is among those that have 31 days. The months with 31 days (January, March, May, July, August, October, and December) are correctly listed, and the function utilizes a membership test (using the `in` operator) to determine if the input month `n` belongs to that set.

The output hints confirm that the program behaves as expected, returning `True` for the specified months and `False` for others, including February and months with 30 days. Given that the input is assumed to be valid (an integer between 1 and 12), there are no edge cases that violate the requirements outlined in the problem description. Therefore, the final assessment of the program's correctness is indeed **True**.
