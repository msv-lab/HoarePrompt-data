Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It splits the input list `lst` into two parts: the first part contains the first `L` elements of the list, and the second part contains the remaining elements. The implementation correctly handles the following cases:

1. If `L` equals 0, the first part of the tuple will be an empty list, while the second part will contain all elements of `lst`.
2. If `L` equals the length of `lst`, the first part will contain all elements of `lst`, and the second part will be an empty list.

While the hints mention that the function does not handle negative values for `L`, the problem description does not explicitly state that negative values will be provided, and it is implied that `L` is a non-negative integer. Therefore, given that the function correctly handles all valid inputs as described in the problem, the overall correctness stands as True.
