Final: **True**

The original assessment correctly identifies that the function `func_1` does not handle cases where `L` exceeds the length of the list `lst`. However, based on the annotations provided, the assumption is made that the input to the function will always be valid, meaning `L` will always be a non-negative integer within the bounds of the list's length (0 <= L <= len(lst)). Given these constraints, the function behaves correctly according to the problem description by returning the appropriate split of the list.

Thus, since the correct behavior for the intended input constraints is fulfilled (even if the function does not handle edge cases), the function is indeed correct based on the problem description and the provided assumptions. The initial assessment mistakenly suggests that the implementation is fundamentally flawed when it actually operates correctly under the stated preconditions. 

Therefore, the final conclusion is that the program is correct given the assumptions made about input validity.
