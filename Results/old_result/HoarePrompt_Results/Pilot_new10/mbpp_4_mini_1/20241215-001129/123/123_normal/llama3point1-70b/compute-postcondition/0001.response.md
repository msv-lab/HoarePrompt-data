The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `L`. `lst` is a list of elements, and `L` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= L <= len(lst). The function returns a tuple containing the first `L` elements of the list `lst` and the remaining elements starting from index `L`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, returning a tuple with the first `L` elements and the rest of the list from index `L`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, returning a tuple with the first `L` elements of the list and the remaining elements starting from index `L`.**
