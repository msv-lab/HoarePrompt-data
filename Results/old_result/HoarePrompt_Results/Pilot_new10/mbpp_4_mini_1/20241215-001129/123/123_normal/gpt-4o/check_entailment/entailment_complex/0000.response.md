Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines the function `func_1`, which takes a list `lst` and a non-negative integer `L`, and splits the list into two parts based on the value of `L`. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of why the implementation meets the expectations:

1. **Splitting the list**: The function constructs the first part of the output by slicing `lst` from the start up to index `L` (`lst[:L]`), which gives the first `L` elements. The second part is created by slicing from index `L` to the end of the list (`lst[L:]`), which gives the remaining elements. This matches the requirement to split the list into two parts where the length of the first part is `L`.

2. **Tuple return**: The function returns a tuple consisting of these two parts, which aligns perfectly with the specification of returning the resulting lists in a tuple.

3. **Handling edge cases**:
    - If `L` is 0, `lst[:0]` results in an empty list, and `lst[0:]` returns the entire list, thus returning `([], lst)`.
    - If `L` equals the length of the list, then `lst[:len(lst)]` will return the full list, and `lst[len(lst):]` will be empty, thus also behaving as expected.

4. **Correctness of assertions**: The assertions provided before the function call validate that typical cases and edge cases are handled correctly. They confirm that the function produces the expected outputs for various list types and lengths.

Overall, the function is implemented correctly and adheres to the problem description for all valid inputs as specified.
