Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and an integer `L`, and it splits the list into two parts: the first part contains the first `L` elements, and the second part contains the elements from index `L` onward. 

The slicing operation `lst[:L]` retrieves the first `L` elements from the list, and `lst[L:]` retrieves the remaining elements starting from index `L`. As a result, the function returns a tuple containing these two parts, which adheres to the requirement of returning the lists in a tuple format.

Additionally, the program includes assertions to test the function against different cases, ensuring that it behaves as expected for various inputs, including lists of integers and strings, which confirm its correctness. The function will only encounter situations where `L` is non-negative and within the bounds defined (0 <= L <= len(lst)), which further assures that the slicing will not result in errors or incorrect outputs. Thus, the implementation consistently meets the problem's requirements.
