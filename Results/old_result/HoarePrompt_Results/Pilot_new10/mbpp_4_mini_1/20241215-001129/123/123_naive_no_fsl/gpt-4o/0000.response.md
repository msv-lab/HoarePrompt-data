To determine the correctness of the provided program, I will analyze how the function implements the requirements from the problem description. The function `func_1(lst, L)` is expected to take a list `lst` and an integer `L`, splitting the list into two parts: the first part with a length of `L` and the second part containing the remaining elements.

Let's consider the provided test cases:

1. `func_1([1, 1, 2, 3, 4, 4, 5, 1], 3)` should return `([1, 1, 2], [3, 4, 4, 5, 1])`
2. `func_1(['a', 'b', 'c', 'd'], 2)` should return `(['a', 'b'], ['c', 'd'])`
3. `func_1(['p', 'y', 't', 'h', 'o', 'n'], 4)` should return `(['p', 'y', 't', 'h'], ['o', 'n'])`

Now, I will check for additional cases:

- **When `L` is greater than the length of the list:** 
  For example, if we call `func_1([1, 2, 3], 5)`, the expected behavior according to the problem statement is not clearly defined but we have to consider what the function should do. The current implementation would return `([1, 2, 3], [])`, which is likely acceptable as the full list is given as the first part.

- **When `L` is negative or zero:** 
  For example, `func_1([1, 2, 3], -1)` will return `([], [1, 2, 3])`, and `func_1([1, 2, 3], 0)` will return `([], [1, 2, 3])`. The problem description does not specify the behavior for these cases, hence the function could be considered to either accept invalid inputs or ignore them and function correctly. However, these cases might not meet the typical expectations of handling such inputs clearly.

In summary, since the function does not clearly define or handle all potential edge cases (particularly regarding negative and zero values for `L`), we can conclude that the function is not fully correct per the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False** 

The function fails to specify handling for certain edge cases like when L is negative or zero, which leads to potential behavior that is not clearly aligned with typical expectations or the problem description.
