Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly uses the `cmath.phase` function to compute the angle (or phase) of a complex number created from the given real and imaginary parts. It handles all potential cases by efficiently dealing with any real or imaginary values, resulting in the expected angle in radians for the complex number. There are no edge cases or scenarios where this implementation would fail to adhere to the problem description.
