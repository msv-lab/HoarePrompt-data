Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes two numerical values representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and returns the phase (or angle) of that complex number using the `cmath.phase` function. The output hints confirm that the function correctly handles cases where the real part is zero, as well as avoids division by zero errors. The provided assertions also demonstrate that the function returns the expected angles for the complex numbers formed from the specified inputs. Since it consistently adheres to the problem description without any identified edge cases that would result in incorrect behavior, the code is deemed correct.
