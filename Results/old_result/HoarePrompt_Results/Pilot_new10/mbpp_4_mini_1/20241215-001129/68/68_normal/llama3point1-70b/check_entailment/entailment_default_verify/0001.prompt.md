You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to get the angle of a complex number.
Program:
```
import cmath

def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to calculate the angle (phase) of a complex number defined by its real and imaginary parts. It uses Python's `cmath` module, which is specifically designed for operations on complex numbers.

Here's how the program works:
1. Takes two inputs: `real` and `imag`.
2. Constructs a complex number using `complex(real, imag)`.
3. Computes the angle of the complex number using `cmath.phase()`, which returns the angle in radians.

The function operates correctly for all potential inputs:
- When both `real` and `imag` are zero, the function will return 0, which is appropriate since the angle is undefined for the origin but conventionally set to 0.
- For positive and negative values of `real` and `imag`, the function correctly computes the angle based on the quadrant in which the complex number lies.

Given this understanding, I found no cases where the function fails to meet the problem requirements. Thus, the implementation is correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts numerical values for the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number created from these values using the cmath library. No edge cases or exceptions are handled in the code, so it assumes the inputs are valid numerical values. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
