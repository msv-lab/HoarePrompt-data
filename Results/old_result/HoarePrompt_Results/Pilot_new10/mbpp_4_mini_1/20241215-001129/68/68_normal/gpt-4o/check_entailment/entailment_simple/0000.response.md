Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the task described in the problem description, which is to get the angle (or phase) of a complex number. Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(real, imag)` is defined to take two parameters, which represent the real part and the imaginary part of a complex number. This aligns with the concept of a complex number being defined as `a + bi`, where `a` is the real part and `b` is the imaginary part.

2. **Complex Number Creation**: Inside the function, a complex number is created using Python's built-in `complex()` function. This is consistent with how complex numbers are typically represented in mathematics.

3. **Calculating the Phase (Angle)**: The function then uses `cmath.phase(complex_number)` to calculate the phase of the complex number. The `cmath.phase()` function returns the angle of the complex number in radians, which is exactly what the problem description requires when referring to getting the angle of a complex number.

4. **Assertions for Testing**: The assertions following the function definition test the function's correctness against known values. These include cases for different combinations of real and imaginary parts of complex numbers, and they verify that the function returns accurate phase values with a reasonable tolerance for floating-point comparison.

Since the function is able to accurately compute the angle for any complex number formed by the inputs `real` and `imag`, it fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description comprehensively.

Therefore, the program is deemed correct.
