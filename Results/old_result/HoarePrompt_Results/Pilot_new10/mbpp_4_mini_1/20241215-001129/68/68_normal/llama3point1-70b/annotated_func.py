#State of the program right berfore the function call: real and imag are numerical values representing the real and imaginary parts of a complex number.
def func_1(real, imag):
    complex_num = complex(real, imag)
    return cmath.phase(complex_num)
    #The program returns the phase (angle) of the complex number created from the given real and imag values, which is equal to cmath.phase(complex(real, imag))
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts numerical values for the real and imaginary parts of a complex number and returns the phase (angle) of the complex number created from these values using the cmath library. No edge cases or exceptions are handled in the code, so it assumes the inputs are valid numerical values.
