The `complex_num` variable is assigned the value represented by a complex number formed from the `real` and `imag` numerical values, which represent the real and imaginary parts, respectively. The output state will include the new state of `complex_num`, which is now a complex number. The states of the other variables (`real`, `imag`) remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`real` is a numerical value, `imag` is a numerical value, `complex_num` is a complex number equal to `complex(real, imag)`**
