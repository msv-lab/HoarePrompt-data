Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description, which is to get the angle of a complex number. 

Here's the breakdown of how the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Parameters**: The function `func_1(real, imag)` takes two parameters: `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively. This aligns with the typical representation of complex numbers.

2. **Formation of Complex Number**: Inside the function, `complex_num` is created using `complex(real, imag)`. This correctly forms a complex number based on the provided real and imaginary parts.

3. **Calculation of Angle**: The function utilizes `cmath.phase(complex_num)` to compute the phase (angle) of the complex number. This is an appropriate use of the `cmath` library to retrieve the angle, as it directly corresponds to the requirement of the problem.

4. **Return Value**: The function returns the angle of the complex number, which is exactly what the problem description calls for.

The only potential weaknesses noted are the lack of edge case handling, such as complex numbers with zero magnitude (which would lead to an angle of zero or undefined), but since the problem description does not specify handling edge cases or give any constraints, the current implementation still meets the requirements as stated. 

Thus, the program correctly fulfills the problem description of calculating and returning the angle of a complex number, leading to the conclusion that it is correct.
