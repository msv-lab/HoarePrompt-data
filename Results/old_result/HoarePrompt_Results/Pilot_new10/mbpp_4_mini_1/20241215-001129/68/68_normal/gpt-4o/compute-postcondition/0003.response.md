Functionality: ** The function accepts two numerical values, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number. It constructs a complex number from these parts and returns its phase (argument), calculated using the `cmath.phase` function. This effectively gives the angle in radians of the complex number in the polar coordinate system. The function correctly handles cases where `real` is zero, and it avoids any division by zero errors since the phase is computed internally using the `cmath` library. **
