Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to get the angle (or phase) of a complex number. 

Hereâ€™s why the program is correct:

1. The function `func_1(real, imag)` takes two arguments, `real` and `imag`, which represent the real and imaginary parts of a complex number, respectively.
2. The line `complex_num = complex(real, imag)` constructs the complex number from the given real and imaginary values.
3. The function then uses the `cmath.phase(complex_num)` function, which returns the angle (or phase) of the complex number in radians.
4. The value returned by `cmath.phase` is precisely the angle that the problem description requires.

This means that for any numerical inputs provided to the function, it will always produce the correct angle of the corresponding complex number, fulfilling the task outlined in the problem description without any exceptions or errors.
