According to the code, the `for` loop will execute based on the length of `sorted_list`. The loop will execute as many times as there are elements in `sorted_list`. If `sorted_list` is empty, the loop will not execute at all. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `sorted_list` must contain at least 1 integer. 

At the end of the last iteration (if it were to run), the variable `i` would represent the current index during the loop execution, which will range from 0 to `len(sorted_list) - 1`. 

Thus, the state needs to include that `sorted_list` has at least 1 integer, and `i` must initially be 0 at the start of the loop.

State: **`sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order that must have at least 1 integer, `i` is 0**
