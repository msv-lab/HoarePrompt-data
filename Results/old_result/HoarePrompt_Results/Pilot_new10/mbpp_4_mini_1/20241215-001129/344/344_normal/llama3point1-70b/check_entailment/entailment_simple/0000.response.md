Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. It correctly implements a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. 

Here's how it does that:

1. **Iterating Through the Sorted List**: The function iterates through each element of the `sorted_list` using a loop. Since the list is guaranteed to be sorted in non-decreasing order, it compares each element of the list with the `value`.

2. **Finding the Insertion Point**: 
   - If it finds any element in the list that is greater than or equal to the `value`, it returns the current index `i`. This index `i` would be the appropriate insertion point for the `value`, ensuring that the list remains sorted after insertion.
   - If the loop completes without finding such an element (which would only happen if all elements in `sorted_list` are less than `value`), the function returns `len(sorted_list)`, which denotes that the `value` should be inserted at the end of the list.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The function correctly handles edge cases, such as:
   - An empty `sorted_list`, where it returns `0` since the insertion point for any value in an empty list is at index `0`.
   - A `value` that is less than all elements in the list, in which case it returns `0`, the correct insertion index.

Overall, the function adheres strictly to the problem description by accurately determining the insertion index for the specified value in the sorted list. Hence, it is a correct implementation.
