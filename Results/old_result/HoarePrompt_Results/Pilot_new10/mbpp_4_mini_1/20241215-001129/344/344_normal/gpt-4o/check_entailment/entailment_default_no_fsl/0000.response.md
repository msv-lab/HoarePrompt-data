Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It leverages the `bisect.bisect_right` method from Python's `bisect` module to find the right insertion point for a value in a sorted list. This ensures the list remains sorted after insertion, even in the presence of duplicate values.

The assertions provided in the program test different scenarios:
- Inserting `6` into `[1, 2, 4, 5]` correctly returns `4`, indicating that `6` can be inserted at the end of the list.
- Inserting `3` into `[1, 2, 4, 5]` returns `2`, which is the correct insertion point between `2` and `4`.
- Inserting `7` also correctly returns `4`, as it can be placed at the end of the list.

The output hints correctly summarize the expected functionality of the program, and no edge cases are overlooked. Overall, the program handles all provided cases accurately, hence the conclusion of correctness.
