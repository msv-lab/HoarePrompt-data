You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
import bisect

assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **False**

The function `func_1` is using `bisect.bisect_right`, which returns the index to insert `value` to the right of any existing entries of that value in `sorted_list`. However, the task is to return the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order, which typically means when the value is already in the list, it should be returned at the position where it could be inserted while maintaining order. 

To elaborate, consider the case where `value` is equal to an element already present in the list. For instance:

```python
assert func_1([1, 2, 2, 4, 5], 2) == 3
```

The expected output in this case should be 2 (the first occurrence of 2) rather than 3, which is what `bisect_right` provides.

Therefore, the program does not handle cases where duplicates are in the list correctly according to the problem description for insertion position, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6) == 4
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7) == 4

import bisect

#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of sorted integers, and value is an integer.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    return bisect.bisect_right(sorted_list, value)
    #The program returns the insertion point in 'sorted_list' where 'value' can be inserted to maintain sorted order, using the bisect_right algorithm from the bisect module.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of sorted integers and an integer value, and returns the insertion point in the list where the value can be inserted to maintain sorted order. It utilizes the `bisect_right` method from the bisect module to determine this position, ensuring that the resulting list remains sorted even with duplicate values. There are no visible edge cases or missing functionality based on the annotated code and the algorithm being used.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
