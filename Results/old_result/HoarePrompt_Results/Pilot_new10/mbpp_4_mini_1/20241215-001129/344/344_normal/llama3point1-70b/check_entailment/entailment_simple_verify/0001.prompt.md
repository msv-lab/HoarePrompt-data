You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to locate the right insertion point for a specified value in sorted order.
Program:
```
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, letâ€™s analyze the problem description and the implementation.

**Problem Description**: The function should locate the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted order.

**Program Implementation**:
```python
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
    return len(sorted_list)
```

### Analyzing the Code

1. **Function Behavior**: 
   - The function iterates over the `sorted_list`.
   - It checks if an element is greater than or equal to the specified `value`.
   - If such an element is found, it returns the index of that element.
   - If no such element is found, it returns the length of the list, which indicates that the value should be inserted at the end.

2. **Correct Cases**:
   - If `sorted_list` is empty and `value` is `5`, it returns `0`, which is correct.
   - If `sorted_list` is `[1, 3, 5]` and `value` is `4`, it correctly returns `2`, as `4` should be inserted at index `2`.
   - If `sorted_list` is `[1, 3, 5]` and `value` is `5`, it returns `2`, which is correct as `5` should be inserted at index `2`.

3. **Testing Edge Cases**:
   - **Case 1**: If `sorted_list` is `[1, 3, 5]` and `value` is `6`, it will return `3`, which is correct because `6` should be inserted at the end.
   - **Case 2**: If `sorted_list` is `[-1, 0, 1]` and `value` is `0`, it returns `1`, which is correct since `0` would go between `-1` and `0`.

### Identifying Potential Issues
Now, we will look for any potential edge cases that could cause the implementation to fail:

- **Negative Values and Zeroes**: The code seems to handle negative numbers and zero correctly.
- **Duplicates**: If we have duplicates, it returns the index of the first occurrence that is equal or greater, which is still valid for insertion logic.

### Conclusion
After testing various scenarios, the function appears to handle all tested cases correctly, including edge cases like empty lists, duplicates, and various values compared against the sorted list.

Therefore, I cannot identify any cases where the implementation fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

**Correctness: True**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: sorted_list is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and value is an integer.
def func_1(sorted_list, value):
    for i in range(len(sorted_list)):
        if sorted_list[i] >= value:
            return i
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `sorted_list` is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `i` is equal to the length of `sorted_list`, and all elements of `sorted_list` are less than `value` (if `sorted_list` is not empty).
    return len(sorted_list)
    #The program returns the length of 'sorted_list', which is a list of integers sorted in non-decreasing order and all elements are less than 'value'.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
