Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Sorted Order**: The function assumes that `sorted_list` is already sorted in non-decreasing order, which is a prerequisite for locating the right insertion point accurately.

2. **Finding Insertion Point**:
   - The function iterates through each element of `sorted_list`. 
   - If it finds an element that is greater than or equal to `value`, it returns the index of that element. This correctly identifies the first position in the list where `value` could be inserted while maintaining sorted order.

3. **All Elements Less Than `value`**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any element greater than or equal to `value`, it returns `len(sorted_list)`. This correctly indicates that `value` should be placed at the end of the list since all existing elements are less than `value`.

4. **Return Values**:
   - The return values (`i` or `len(sorted_list)`) are consistent with the requested behavior of providing the correct insertion point.

5. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The function handles the case when `sorted_list` is empty, as it would return `0`, which is the correct insertion point for any value.

Overall, the program logic adheres to the requirements of locating the right insertion point for an integer in a sorted list, making it correct according to the problem description.
