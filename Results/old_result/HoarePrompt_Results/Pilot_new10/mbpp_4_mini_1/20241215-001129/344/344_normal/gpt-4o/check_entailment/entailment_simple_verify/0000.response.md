Final: **True**

The original assessment incorrectly concluded that the program was incorrect. The annotated code demonstrates that the function `func_1` uses the `bisect.bisect_right()` function correctly to find the insertion point for a specified value in sorted order. The assertions provided do validate the function's correctness for the given test cases. 

The results for the assertions:
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 6)` yields `4`, which is accurate since `6` should be inserted at index `4`.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 3)` yields `2`, which is correct because `3` should be inserted at index `2`.
- `func_1([1, 2, 4, 5], 7)` yields `4`, which is also correct since `7` should be inserted at index `4`.

The fact that the function is defined after the assertions could lead to an error if the code was executed directly without rearranging the function definition. However, this does not affect the functionality of the program itself once defined correctly. 

Additionally, the concern regarding edge cases (like negative numbers and duplicates) mentioned in the original assessment does not invalidate the core functionality of the program, especially since valid inputs were assumed.

Overall, the function meets the problem description's requirement effectively, so the final assessment of its correctness should be **True**.
