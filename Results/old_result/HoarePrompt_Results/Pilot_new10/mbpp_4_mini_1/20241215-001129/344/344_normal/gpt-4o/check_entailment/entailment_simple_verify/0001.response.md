Final: **False**

The original assessment was accurate because it highlighted that `bisect.bisect_right` returns the position to the right of existing entries for the specified value, which does not meet the requirement of returning the correct insertion point for maintaining order. According to the problem description, if the specified value is already in the sorted list, the function should return the index of the first occurrence of that value, not the index to the right of it. Thus, the program does not handle such cases correctly, confirming that it is not correct per the problem requirements.
