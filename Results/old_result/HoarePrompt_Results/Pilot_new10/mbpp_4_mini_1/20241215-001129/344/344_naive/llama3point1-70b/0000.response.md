Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` correctly identifies the right insertion point for a specified value in a sorted list. The logic used in the program iterates through the sorted list to find the first index where the value is less than or equal to the current element, which guarantees the correct insertion index if the input list is already sorted.

All potential cases are handled, including cases where:
1. The value is less than all elements in the list (returns 0).
2. The value is greater than all elements (returns the length of the list).
3. The value is equal to some elements (returns the index of the first equal or greater element).

Thus, the program satisfies the requirements stated in the problem description for every potential case.
