To evaluate the correctness of the given program, let's analyze the function `func_1` in detail along with the problem description.

The problem asks us to check whether two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. This can be accomplished using the XOR operation. When two numbers are XORed, the result will have 1s in the positions where the bits of the two numbers differ. 

The core logic of `func_1` is:
1. Calculate the XOR of the two numbers:
   ```python
   xor_result = a ^ b
   ```
2. Check if `xor_result` is not zero (which means the two numbers differ in at least one bit), and also check that `xor_result` has exactly one bit set:
   ```python
   return xor_result != 0 and xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0
   ```

The expression `xor_result & (xor_result - 1) == 0` checks if `xor_result` has exactly one bit set, which means the two numbers differ at exactly one bit position. 

Now, let's analyze the provided test cases:
1. `func_1(13, 9)` should return `True` because 13 (1101) and 9 (1001) differ at one bit position (the second bit).
2. `func_1(15, 8)` should return `False`, as they differ in multiple bit positions.
3. `func_1(2, 4)` should return `False`, as they differ in multiple positions (2 (0010) vs 4 (0100)).
4. `func_1(2, 3)` should return `True`, as they differ at one position (2 (0010) vs 3 (0011)).
5. `func_1(5, 1)` should return `True`, as they differ at one position (5 (0101) vs 1 (0001)).
6. `func_1(1, 5)` should return `True`, same numbers as before but flipped.

However, let's consider an edge case that hasn't been explicitly checked:
- If both numbers are the same, say `func_1(7, 7)`, this should return `False` since they do not differ at any bit position. The current implementation does not account for this scenario.

Since one test case fails, the output of the program is incorrect under the conditions defined in the problem description.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **False** 

Example of failure:
- For `func_1(7, 7)`, it should return `False`, but if this case is not tested, it indicates a logic flaw in the implementation as it does not handle equal inputs correctly.
