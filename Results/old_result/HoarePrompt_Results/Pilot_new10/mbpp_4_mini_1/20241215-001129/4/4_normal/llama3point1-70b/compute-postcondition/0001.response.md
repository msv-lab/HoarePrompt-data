The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `num1` and `num2`. Both `num1` and `num2` are integers. After executing the function body, the function determines whether the binary representation of the bitwise XOR of `num1` and `num2` has exactly one '1'. If this condition is met, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters, `num1` and `num2`, and return `True` if the XOR of these integers has exactly one '1' in its binary representation, or `False` otherwise. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, num1 and num2, and returns True if the binary representation of the bitwise XOR of num1 and num2 has exactly one '1'. If not, it returns False.**
