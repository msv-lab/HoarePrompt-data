Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly extracts the last character of each string in the given tuple. It utilizes list comprehension effectively to iterate over each string and access its last index using `s[-1]`. The logic assumes that the strings are non-empty, which is typically valid for a function like this when dealing with general strings. If the input is an empty string, it will still handle it by returning an appropriate value (an empty string for that particular string). Therefore, for any tuple of strings provided, it will correctly return a list of the last characters, meeting the problem description's requirements.
