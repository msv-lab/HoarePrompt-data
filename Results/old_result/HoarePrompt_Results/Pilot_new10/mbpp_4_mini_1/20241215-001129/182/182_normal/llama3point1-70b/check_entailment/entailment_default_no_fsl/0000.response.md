Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when any string in the tuple is empty. According to the problem description, the function is supposed to extract the last character of each string in the tuple. However, the output hints indicate that if an empty string is encountered, it raises an `IndexError`. This means that the program will fail and not produce a valid output for cases where there is at least one empty string in the tuple. Therefore, since the code does not function correctly for all potential cases, the correctness is deemed false.
