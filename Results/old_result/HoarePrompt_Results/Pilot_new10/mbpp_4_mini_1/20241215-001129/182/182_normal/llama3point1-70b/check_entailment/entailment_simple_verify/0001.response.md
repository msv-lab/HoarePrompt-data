Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate based on the problem description and the annotated version of the code. The program `func_1` correctly extracts the last character of each string in a given tuple of strings, assuming the input will be a valid tuple of non-empty strings. The code utilizes a list comprehension to effectively obtain the intended elements, and the annotations confirm the expected behavior of the function. Given the assumption that the input will not lead to any errors (such as empty strings or non-string elements), the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
