Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple of strings and returns a list containing the last character of each string in the tuple. If any string in the tuple is empty, an error will occur due to attempting to access an index that does not exist. Therefore, it is important to ensure that all strings in the tuple are non-empty to avoid an IndexError. **
