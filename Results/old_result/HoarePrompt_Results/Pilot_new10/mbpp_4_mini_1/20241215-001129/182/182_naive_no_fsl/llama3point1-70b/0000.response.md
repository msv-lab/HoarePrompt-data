Correctness: **True**

The provided program `func_1` correctly extracts the last character of each string in a given tuple of strings. It does so by using a list comprehension that iterates over each string `s`, and retrieves the last character using `s[-1]`. 

After considering various potential cases:

1. **Case with non-empty strings**: For example, if the input is `("hello", "world")`, the output will be `['o', 'd']`, which satisfies the requirement.

2. **Case with empty strings**: If the input contains an empty string, such as `("", "abc")`, it will raise an `IndexError` because it tries to access the last character of an empty string. This is a potential edge case that is not handled in the code.

3. **Case with non-string elements**: If the tuple contains non-string elements, like `(123, "abc")`, it will also raise a `TypeError` because slicing a non-string will not work.

Since the program does not handle the case of empty strings or non-string elements, it fails to meet the completeness requirement of the problem description.

Therefore, the program is incorrect for these reasons.

Correctness: **False**
