Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case of unmatched closing brackets. Specifically, if the first closing bracket is reached before its corresponding opening bracket, the program should return `False`, but it only checks for an empty stack after processing all characters. 

For example, the input `'{()}[{]'` is incorrectly represented to return `False` as it has unmatched brackets, but the program would check the stack at the end and may mistakenly return `True`. 

Here's a potential test case that demonstrates the issue:
```python
assert func_1('{[()]}[{}[](') == False
```

In this case, the expression contains unbalanced brackets, and the program would fail to appropriately identify it as such.
