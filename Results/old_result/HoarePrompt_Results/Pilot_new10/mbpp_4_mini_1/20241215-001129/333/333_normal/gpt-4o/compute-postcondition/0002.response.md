According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `expr` string. For the loop to execute, `expr` must contain at least one character. Since `stack` is initialized as an empty list at the start, it does not affect the execution of the loop. 

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `expr` must be a string with at least one character. The variable `char` will be the first character in the `expr` string during the first iteration.

State: **`expr` is a string with at least 1 character, `stack` is an empty list, `char` is the first character of `expr`**
