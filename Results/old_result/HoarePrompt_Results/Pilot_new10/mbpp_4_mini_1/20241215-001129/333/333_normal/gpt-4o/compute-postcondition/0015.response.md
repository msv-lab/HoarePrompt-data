Postcondition: ***`expr` is a string with at least 2 characters, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and `stack` contains the previous character processed if it is in `matching_pairs`. If `stack` is empty or the popped character from `stack` does not match `matching_pairs[char]`, the function returns False. If the conditions are not met, the program proceeds without a return value.***
