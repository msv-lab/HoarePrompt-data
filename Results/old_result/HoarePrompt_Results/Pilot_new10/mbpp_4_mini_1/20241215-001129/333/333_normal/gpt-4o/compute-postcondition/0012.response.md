According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there are characters left in `expr` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, we have a string `expr` that contains at least 1 character. In each iteration of the loop, `char` is assigned the next character of `expr`.

If the loop has just completed an iteration, for it to execute one more time, `char` must be assigned the next character in the string. Since `char` is determined by iterating through `expr`, we increment the index corresponding to the character being processed. Therefore, if the last character processed was at index `i`, the next character will be at index `i + 1`.

To assess the states: 
- `expr` still contains at least 1 character.
- We must ensure that `char` will have a valid value (a character from `expr`), and that the loop continues to run for more characters.

Consequently, for the loop to execute one more time, `expr` must have at least 2 characters in total, enabling the next character to be available to assign to `char`.

State: **`expr` is a string with at least 2 characters, `char` must be the next character in `expr`, and `stack` contains the previous character processed if it is in `matching_pairs`**.
