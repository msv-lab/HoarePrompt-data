The code `stack.append(char)` appends the character `char` to the list `stack`. Given that `expression` is a non-empty string with `n` characters, and `char` is defined as the `n-th` character in that string, `char` has a specific value corresponding to the last character of `expression`.

Since only the stack is modified and `char` is based on the `expression`, the output state will reflect that `stack` now includes the last character of `expression`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`expression` is a non-empty string with `n` characters; `char` is the `n-th` character of `expression`; `stack` now includes `char`.**
