The code appends `char` to the list `stack`. The variable `char` refers to the next character in `expr`, which means that `char` has a specific value based on the context of its assignment, and `stack` is being modified to include this new character.

Other variables, such as `expr`, remain unchanged, as the code affects only `stack`. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated `stack` with the new `char` value appended.

Output State: **`expr` is a string with at least 2 characters, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and `stack` now includes `char` as an additional element.**
