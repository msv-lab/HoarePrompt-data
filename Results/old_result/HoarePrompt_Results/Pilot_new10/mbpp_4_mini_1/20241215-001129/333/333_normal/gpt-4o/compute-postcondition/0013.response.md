The `stack` has an element appended to it, specifically the value of `char`. The previous value of `char` is the next character in `expr`. The `expr` string remains unchanged, and `stack` now contains an additional character. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`expr` is a string with at least 2 characters, `char` is the next character in `expr`, `stack` contains the previous character processed, plus `char` has been added to it.**
