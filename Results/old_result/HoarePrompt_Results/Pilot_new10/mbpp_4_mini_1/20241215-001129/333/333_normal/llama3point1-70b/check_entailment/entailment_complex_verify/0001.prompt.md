You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check if the given expression is balanced or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(expression: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
    return not stack


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the program's logic for checking whether an expression is balanced with respect to parentheses, curly braces, and square brackets.

The key aspects of a balanced expression are as follows:
1. Every opening bracket must have a corresponding closing bracket of the same type.
2. Brackets must be closed in the correct order; that is, the last opened bracket must be the first to be closed (LIFO - Last In, First Out).

Now, let's analyze the provided program step-by-step:

```python
def func_1(expression: str) -> bool:
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)  # Push opening brackets onto stack
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:  # Check for matching closing bracket
                return False
    return not stack  # Return True if no unmatched opening brackets remain
```

### Potential Edge Cases to Consider:

1. **Empty String**: The function should return `True` for an empty string since there are no unmatched brackets.
  
2. **Simple Balanced Expressions**: Strings like `"()"`, `"{}"`, `"[]"`, `"({[]})"` should return `True`.

3. **Unbalanced Expressions**:
   - Cases like `")"`, `"("`, `"{]", "[}"`, `"(()"`, which should return `False`.
   - The function will handle these cases correctly as it checks if there are unmatched closing brackets or unmatched opening brackets.

4. **Nested and Mixed Bracket Cases**:
   - Strings like `"((()))"`, `"{[()]}"` should return `True`.
   - Strings like `"{[(])}"` should return `False`.

5. **Non-bracket Characters**: The function does not account for and ignores non-bracket characters, which is acceptable based on the problem description that only mentions brackets.

### Analysis and Conclusion:
After analyzing the program, it correctly handles various edge cases and adheres to the problem description effectively. The program checks for matching closing brackets and ensures that opening brackets are properly closed in the correct order, returning `False` when mismatches are found.

Since I can think of no potential inputs or edge cases where this implementation would fail, I conclude that the program successfully satisfies the problem requirements.

Correctness: **True**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: expression is a string that may contain various characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces.
def func_1(expression):
    stack = []
    brackets = {'(': ')', '{': '}', '[': ']'}
    for char in expression:
        if char in brackets:
            stack.append(char)
        elif char in brackets.values():
            if not stack or brackets[stack.pop()] != char:
                return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `expression` is a string; `stack` is a list that contains only the opening brackets in the order they were encountered in `expression`. If `stack` is empty after the loop, `expression` contains balanced brackets. If `stack` is not empty, then `expression` contains unbalanced brackets.
    return not stack
    #The program returns True if the 'expression' contains balanced brackets (i.e., stack is empty), and returns False if the 'expression' contains unbalanced brackets (i.e., stack is not empty).
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `expression` and checks for balanced brackets. It returns True if all opening brackets have corresponding closing brackets in the correct order, and returns False if the brackets are unbalanced or if a closing bracket appears without a matching opening bracket.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
