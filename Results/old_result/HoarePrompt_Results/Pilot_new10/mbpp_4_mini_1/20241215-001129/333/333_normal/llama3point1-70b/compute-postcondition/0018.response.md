According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `expression`. Since `expression` is a non-empty string that has `n - 1` characters, the loop will execute for each character in `expression`. At the end of the last iteration, `expression` has `n - 1` characters, which indicates that `char` is the last character processed in the string. 

For the loop to execute one more time, there needs to be one more character in `expression`, meaning that `expression` now must have `n` characters. In this case, `char` would be the `n-th` character of that new `expression`. 

State: **`expression` is a non-empty string with `n` characters, `char` is the `n-th` character in the string.**
