According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the `expr` string. The character `char` is the next character being processed in the string. Given that `expr` has at least 2 characters, the loop can execute again if there are more characters to iterate through.

At the end of the last iteration, the next character `char` has been retrieved from `expr`, and it has been established whether it is being added to the `stack` or is causing a return value due to mismatched pairs.

To set the state for the next iteration, we need to determine what the next character will be and update the `char` accordingly. If `char` is the last character in the string `expr`, the loop will terminate; if not, `char` will be assigned to the next character.

We need to ensure that `expr` remains a string with at least 2 characters, and if `char` was correctly processed, we should update it to the next character in the string. 

Hence, if `char` is currently processed, we will increment our position in the string to prepare for the next iteration.

State: **`expr` is a string with at least 2 characters, `char` is the next character in `expr`, and it must be updated to the next character for further processing.**
