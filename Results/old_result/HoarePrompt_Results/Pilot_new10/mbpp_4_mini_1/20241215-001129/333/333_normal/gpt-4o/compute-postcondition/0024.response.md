To determine the final output state after all iterations of the loop have been executed, we need to analyze how the stack is modified based on the characters processed in the expression string `expr`. 

The loop processes each character in `expr`, modifying `stack` as follows:

- If a character is an opening bracket (one of '(', '[', or '{'), it is appended to `stack`.
- If a character is a closing bracket (one of ')', ']', or '}'), the loop checks if `stack` is empty or if the last character popped from `stack` does not correspond to the matching opening bracket for the current closing bracket. If either condition is true, it returns `False`.

The output state should reflect the relationship among the characters processed and the state of `stack` at the end of processing `expr`.

If the entire `expr` is valid (all opening brackets have matching closing brackets), `stack` will be empty after all iterations. If any mismatches occur, the loop will return `False` without completing all iterations.

Given the analysis above, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **`expr` is a string consisting of characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces; `stack` is empty if `expr` is valid (all pairs matched), otherwise it contains unmatched opening brackets; the matching pairs of brackets are stored in `matching_pairs`.**
