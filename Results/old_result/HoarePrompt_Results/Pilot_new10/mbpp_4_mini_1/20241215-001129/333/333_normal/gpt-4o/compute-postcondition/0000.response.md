The code initializes the variable `stack` as an empty list. The initial state of `expr` is unchanged, and the new variable `stack` does not affect any other variables. Therefore, the output state represents the unchanged state of `expr` along with the new state of `stack`.

Output State: **`expr` is a string that contains characters including parentheses, brackets, and braces, and may also include other characters; `stack` is an empty list.**
