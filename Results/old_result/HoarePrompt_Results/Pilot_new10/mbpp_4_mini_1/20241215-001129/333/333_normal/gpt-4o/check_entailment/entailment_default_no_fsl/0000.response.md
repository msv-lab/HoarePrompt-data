Correctness: **False**

The program does not account for cases where there are unmatched non-bracket characters, as stated in the output hints. For example, if the input expression is `'{a}(b)[c]{'`, the function would incorrectly return `False` because it checks for balanced brackets only, while there are unmatched non-bracket characters which should also be considered in determining the correctness of the expression. Therefore, the function does not follow the problem description for every potential case as it ignores characters other than brackets. Additionally, the program should handle cases where the brackets are mixed with other characters, which is not currently implemented in the `func_1`. This leads to the conclusion of incorrectness.
