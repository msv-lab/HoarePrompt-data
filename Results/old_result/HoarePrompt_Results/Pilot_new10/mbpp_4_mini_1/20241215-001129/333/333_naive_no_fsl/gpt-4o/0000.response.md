Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` is designed to check if a given expression containing parentheses, brackets, and braces is balanced. 

### Explanation:

1. **Initialization**: The function starts by initializing an empty list `stack` to keep track of opening brackets.

2. **Matching Pairs**: It defines a dictionary `matching_pairs` that maps closing brackets to their corresponding opening brackets.

3. **Iteration through characters**: For each character in the input expression:
   - If the character is an opening bracket (`(`, `[`, `{`), it is appended to `stack`.
   - If the character is a closing bracket (`)`, `]`, `}`):
     - First, the function checks if `stack` is empty (which would mean there is no corresponding opening bracket), or if the last item popped from `stack` does not match the expected closing bracket using `matching_pairs`.

4. **Return value**: Finally, it returns `True` if `stack` is empty (indicating that all opening brackets have been matched), and `False` otherwise.

### Analysis of Given Test Cases:
- `func_1('{()}[{}]')` returns `True`: The expression is balanced.
- `func_1('{()}[{]')` returns `False`: The expression is unbalanced due to the mismatched opening and closing brackets.
- `func_1('{()}[{}][]({})')` returns `True`: The expression is balanced.

### Additional Tests and Edge Cases:
Upon reviewing additional potential cases:
- Empty string `func_1('')` should return `True` as there are no unmatched brackets.
- Single opening bracket `func_1('(')` should return `False` as it is unmatched.
- Single closing bracket `func_1(')')` should return `False` as there is no opening match.
- Nested brackets `func_1('{[()]}')` should return `True` as all brackets are correctly nested and matched.

The function correctly handles these relatively straightforward cases, indicating it is robust against the types of valid and invalid strings one might provide as input. Thus, I have not identified any cases where the function fails to meet the problem description.

Therefore, the function is correct for the requirements specified.
