Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1` is defined to take two numbers, `a` and `b`, and returns a tuple with the second number followed by the first number, as specified in the problem description. The test assertions provided confirm that the function behaves correctly for the specified cases. 

1. For `func_1(10, 20)`, the output is `(20, 10)`, which matches the requirement.
2. For `func_1(15, 17)`, the output is `(17, 15)`, which also matches.
3. For `func_1(100, 200)`, the output is `(200, 100)`, meeting the requirement as well.

Since all tested cases work correctly and the function adheres to the problem description, I believe the implementation is correct.
