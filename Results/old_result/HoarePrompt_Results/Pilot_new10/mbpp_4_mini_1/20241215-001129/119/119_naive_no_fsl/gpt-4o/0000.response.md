Correctness: **True**

The provided program implements the function `func_1` which takes two numbers as inputs, `a` and `b`, and correctly returns a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number (i.e., `(b, a)`). 

The assertions in the code confirm that for various pairs of input values, the function consistently returns the expected output, which is a tuple with the second number first and then the first number. 

Since the function correctly handles the described functionality for all tested cases, and I cannot identify any input where it would fail to perform correctly as described, I conclude that the program meets the problem requirements. Thus, I believe the program is correct in every case.
