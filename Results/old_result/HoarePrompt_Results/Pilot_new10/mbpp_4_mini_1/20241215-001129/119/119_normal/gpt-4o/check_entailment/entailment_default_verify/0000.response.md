Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the behavior as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` correctly takes two parameters `a` and `b`, returning them in swapped order as a tuple `(b, a)`. The assertions confirm that the function behaves correctly for the tested cases, and the output hints align with this functionality, clarifying that the function is designed to handle both integers and floats without any issues. Therefore, the implementation adheres to the problem requirements, justifying the assessment of correctness as **True**.
