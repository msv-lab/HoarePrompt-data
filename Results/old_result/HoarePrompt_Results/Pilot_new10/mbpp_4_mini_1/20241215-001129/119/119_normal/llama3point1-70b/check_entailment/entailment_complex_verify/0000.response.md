Final: **True** 

The program correctly implements the problem description by accepting two numbers and returning a tuple with the second number followed by the first number. The annotated version confirms that both `a` and `b` are treated as integers, and the return statement indeed outputs the values in the specified format (b, a). There are no discrepancies or edge cases noted that would invalidate the original assessment. Thus, the program meets the requirements accurately.
