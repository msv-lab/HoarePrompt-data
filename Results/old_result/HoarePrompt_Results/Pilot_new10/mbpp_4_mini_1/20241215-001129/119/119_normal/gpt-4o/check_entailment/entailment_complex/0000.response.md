Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem description. 

1. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are specified to be either integers or floats.
2. It returns a tuple `(b, a)`, which corresponds to the second number followed by the first number, as required by the problem description.
3. The assertions provided in the annotated program validate that the function works correctly for specific test cases, confirming it swaps the order of the inputs as intended.

Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description in all cases where it is invoked with valid numerical arguments.
