Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are both integers as stated. It then correctly returns a tuple containing the second number (`b`) followed by the first number (`a`). 

The problem description specifically asks for a function that returns a tuple with the second number first and the first number second, which the provided function does by returning `b, a`. Therefore, the output format and order required in the problem statement are satisfied.

Because the function properly implements the specified behavior for any integer inputs `a` and `b`, we can conclude that it fulfills the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
