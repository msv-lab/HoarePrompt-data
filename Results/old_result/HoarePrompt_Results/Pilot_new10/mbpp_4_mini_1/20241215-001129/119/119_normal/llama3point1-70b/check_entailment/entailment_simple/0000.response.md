Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` takes two parameters: `a` and `b`, which are integers. It returns a tuple in the order specified by the problem description: the second number `b` is placed first in the tuple, followed by the first number `a`. 

For any integers passed to the function, the output will always be a tuple with the second integer followed by the first integer, which is exactly what the problem asks for. Therefore, the implementation adheres to the specified behavior, confirming its correctness.
