Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The program correctly implements the requirement of the problem description, which states that the function should return a tuple containing the second number followed by the first number. The assertions provided in the annotations confirm that the function behaves as expected with the provided test cases. Additionally, the state of the program prior to the function call indicates that the variables `a` and `b` are indeed numbers, and the function swaps them correctly upon execution. Given that all tested cases work as intended and comply with the requirement, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
