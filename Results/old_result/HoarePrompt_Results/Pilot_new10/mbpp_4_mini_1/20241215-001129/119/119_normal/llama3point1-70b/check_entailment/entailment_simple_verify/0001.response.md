Final: **True**

The original assessment remains accurate. The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. The function `func_1(a, b)` appropriately takes two integer parameters and returns a tuple with the second parameter `b` first, followed by the first parameter `a`. The annotated version supports this, indicating that the program returns the expected output format without any issues. 

Both the original assessment and the annotations confirm that there are no edge cases to consider given the assumption that inputs will be valid integers. Therefore, based on the problem description and the annotations, the program is deemed correct.
