Correctness: **False**

The implementation has a logical issue when handling input tuples of length 1. According to the problem description, the function should return a tuple of length N, where N is the length of the input tuple minus 1. However, if the input tuple contains only one element, the function returns an empty tuple, which might be acceptable, but it does not fall in line with the behavior described.

For example, the following case is present in the assertions:

```python
assert func_1((12,)) == ()
```

This input corresponds to a tuple of length 1, yet the expected output should logically be determined by how the prompt describes behavior for inputs of this type. The prompt does not specify what should happen for a single-element tuple, and thus the current output (an empty tuple) can be considered incorrect or undefined as there is no logic to handle this edge case.

More specifically:
- The function does not raise an error or provide a value for cases where the length of the input tuple is 1, nor does it clarify what the expected output should be for such cases.

Because of the ambiguity regarding the single-element tuple case and the fact that the function does not handle it in a potentially meaningful way (as described by the task), the assertion fails to meet the problem requirements where N should be at least 1 for valid output values.

Hence, the output for `(12,)` being `()` signifies a logical gap in the expected behavior, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is indeed false.
