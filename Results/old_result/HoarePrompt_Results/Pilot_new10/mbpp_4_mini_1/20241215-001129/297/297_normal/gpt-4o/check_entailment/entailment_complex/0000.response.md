Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description. Specifically, it defines a function `func_1` which accepts a tuple `t` of length at least 2 and returns a new tuple consisting of the products of adjacent elements in `t`.

Here's why the implementation meets the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function is designed to work specifically with tuples having at least two elements, as stated in the problem description. The type of elements (integers or floats) is also aligned with the function's capability to multiply numerical values.

2. **Logic**: The function uses a generator expression to iterate through the indices of the tuple `t` from `0` to `len(t) - 2`. For each index `i`, the expression computes the product of the element at index `i` and the element at index `i + 1`, which satisfies the requirement that the output tuple's i-th element must be equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

3. **Output**: The resulting tuple is constructed by the `tuple()` function, ensuring that the final return value is indeed a tuple of the correct length (N), where N is the original length of the tuple minus one.

4. **Test Cases**: The provided assertions thoroughly test the function with valid inputs, and they all pass, as the output matches the expected results defined in the problem description.

5. **Error Handling**: Although the function does not explicitly handle non-numeric types, the way it is described in the assertions implies that the function is called with valid numerical data types, consistent with the expected input condition defined in the state before the function call.

In conclusion, the implementation correctly adheres to the problem description and fulfills the requirements for every potential case it is expected to handle based on the annotations. Therefore, the overall correctness evaluation is **True**.
