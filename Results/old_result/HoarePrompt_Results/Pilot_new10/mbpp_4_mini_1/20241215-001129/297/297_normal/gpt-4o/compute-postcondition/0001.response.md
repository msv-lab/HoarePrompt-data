The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `t`. `t` is a tuple of numbers with a length of at least 2, where each element can be of any numeric type (integers or floats). The function returns a tuple where each element is the product of adjacent elements in the tuple `t`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple of numbers and return a new tuple containing the products of adjacent elements from the input tuple. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `t` of numbers (with length at least 2) and returns a tuple where each element is the product of adjacent elements in `t`.**
