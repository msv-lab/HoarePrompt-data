In examining the provided code and the problem description, the function `func_1` is designed to take a tuple of numbers and return a new tuple of products of consecutive elements.

Let's break down the requirements and the function:

- Problem description: It states that given a tuple `(t_1, ..., t_{N+1})`, the function should return a tuple of length `N` where the `i-th` element is equal to `t_i * t_{i+1}`.
- Code: The function uses `zip` to pair each element of the input tuple `numbers` with its following element (i.e., `numbers[1:]`), and then computes the product of each of these pairs.

The output hints clarify that if the input tuple has less than two elements, the function will return an empty tuple, implying no consecutive pairs exist to form products.

To check correctness, consider any cases:

1. If the input tuple is `(1, 2, 3)`, the output will be `(1*2, 2*3) = (2, 6)`.
2. For an input tuple with less than two elements, such as `(5,)` or `()`, the output will be `()`.

There seem to be no edge cases where the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description and also the output hints align with the functionality of the code.

Overall, since the function correctly handles the multiplication of consecutive elements and properly returns an empty tuple for cases of insufficient input, the implementation seems to adhere to the problem requirements in all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
