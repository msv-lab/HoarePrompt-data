The annotated program is attempting to implement the functionality described in the problem description. Here's the analysis of both the problem description and the program:

### Problem Description:
- The function must take a tuple of numbers `(t_1, ..., t_{N+1})`.
- It should return a tuple of length `N`, where each element at index `i` is the product of the elements at index `i` and `i+1` from the input tuple.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(t):
    return tuple(t[i] * t[i + 1] for i in range(len(t) - 1))
```

### Assertions:
- The assertions provided test various input cases, including tuples of different lengths and values.

### Explanation of the Program:
- The function uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the input tuple from `0` to `len(t) - 2`.
- For each index `i`, it computes the product of the elements `t[i]` and `t[i + 1]`.
- Finally, it collects these products into a new tuple, which will have a length of `N` (where `N` is `len(t) - 1`).

### Analysis:
1. The output tuple's length matches `N`, which is `len(t) - 1`.
2. The operation performed within the tuple construction aligns with the problem statement, calculating the product of adjacent elements in the input tuple.

### Edge Cases:
- The program handles the provided edge case `(12,)` correctly by returning `()`, since a tuple with only one element does not fit the required input for calculating products.

### Conclusion:
The program satisfies the requirements set forth in the problem description. It appropriately computes the products of adjacent elements and returns a correctly sized tuple.

Correctness: **True**
