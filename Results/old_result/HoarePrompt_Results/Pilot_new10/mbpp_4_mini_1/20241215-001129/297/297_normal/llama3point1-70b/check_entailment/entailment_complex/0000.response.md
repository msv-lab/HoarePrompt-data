Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input and Output Specification**: The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `numbers` containing `N+1` elements. According to the problem description, it must return a tuple of length `N`. The program adheres to this by using the `zip` function to pair each element of the tuple with its consecutive neighbor. 

2. **Consecutive Products**: The logic of `zip(numbers, numbers[1:])` creates pairs of consecutive elements from the `numbers` tuple. For instance, if `numbers` is `(t1, t2, t3)`, the zip will create pairs: `((t1, t2), (t2, t3))`. The subsequent multiplication within the tuple comprehension results in the product of these pairs, which aligns with the requirement that the i-th element of the returned tuple equals `t_i * t_{i+1}`.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**: The program implicitly handles the case where the input tuple has less than two elements. If `numbers` contains fewer than two elements (like an empty tuple or a tuple with one element), `zip` will return an empty iterator, and thus the resulting tuple will be empty. This behavior is in line with the problem description stating that if the input has less than two elements, it returns an empty tuple.

In conclusion, the program functions as required by the problem description for all valid input cases, producing the correct output every time.
