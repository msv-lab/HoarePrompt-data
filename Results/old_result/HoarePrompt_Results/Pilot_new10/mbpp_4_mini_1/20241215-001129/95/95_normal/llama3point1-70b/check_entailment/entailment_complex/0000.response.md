Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` as input and uses the method `s.count('std')` to count and return the number of occurrences of the substring `'std'` within that string. 

Here are a few reasons why the program meets the requirements set forth in the problem description:

1. **Input Handling**: The function accepts a string `s`, which is explicitly stated in the problem description.

2. **Count of Substring**: The method `count('std')` correctly finds all non-overlapping occurrences of the substring `'std'` in the string. This accurately aligns with the requirement to determine the number of occurrences of `'std'`.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the count, which is precisely what the problem asks for.

4. **Accuracy**: The comment in the code indicates that it also counts overlapping occurrences, which addresses any edge cases where such occurrences are present. 

Overall, the function meets the criteria of the problem description in all scenarios, thus confirming its correctness.
