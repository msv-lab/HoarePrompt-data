Correctness: **True**

The program accurately fulfills the problem description by correctly counting the number of occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string. The function `func_1(s)` uses the `count()` method of Python strings, which is an efficient and straightforward way to count non-overlapping occurrences of a substring.

All assertions provided in the annotated program test various cases, including:
- A string with multiple occurrences of 'std' (`'letstdlenstdporstd'`) correctly returns 3.
- A string with a single occurrence of 'std' (`'truststdsolensporsd'`) returns 1.
- A string with two occurrences (`'makestdsostdworthit'`) returns 2.
- A string that contains only 'std' (`'stds'`) returns 1.
- An empty string (`''`) correctly returns 0, indicating no occurrences of 'std'.

The function operates under the assumption that 'std' is treated as a literal substring, and there are no edge cases or special characters in this context that would be ignored.

Since it meets all conditions specified in the problem description for any potential input string, the program can be confidently considered correct.
