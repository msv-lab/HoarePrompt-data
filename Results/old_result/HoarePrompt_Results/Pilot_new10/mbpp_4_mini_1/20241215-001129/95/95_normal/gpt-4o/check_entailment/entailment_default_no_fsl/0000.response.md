Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle overlapping occurrences of the substring 'std'. For example, in the string 'stdstd', the correct count should be 2, because 'std' appears twice in overlapping positions (the second 'std' starts before the first 'std' ends). However, the `count` method used in the function does not count overlapping occurrences, and it will return 1 for this input instead of the correct value of 2. This means there are cases where the function does not provide the expected output as required by the problem description.
