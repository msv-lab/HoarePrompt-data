The original assessment states that the program is correct, and it is based on the evaluation of the function `func_1`, which uses Python's built-in `str.count()` method. This built-in method counts non-overlapping occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string, which aligns with the problem description that specifies counting occurrences of 'std'.

However, the output hint suggests that the function is able to count overlapping occurrences of 'std', which is misleading since `str.count()` does not count overlapping occurrences. This discrepancy means that the output hint does not correctly reflect the behavior of the function as defined by the Python standard library.

Given this, the function does not fulfill the expected functionality as described in the problem description, where there may be cases with overlapping substrings of 'std'. 

Because of this essential discrepancy regarding overlapping occurrences, the original assessment of the function's correctness is inaccurate. 

Final: **False**.
