Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality required by the problem description. The function `func_1(s)` takes a string `s` as input and uses the built-in string method `count()` to count the number of occurrences of the substring `'std'` within that string. This directly matches the requirement specified in the problem description, which asks for a function to count how many times the string `'std'` appears in the given string. 

The use of `s.count('std')` will correctly return an integer value representing the total count of non-overlapping occurrences of the substring `'std'`, thus fulfilling the problem's requirement for all potential cases where the input is a string. Therefore, the program is correct.
