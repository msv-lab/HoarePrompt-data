Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1(s: str) -> int` correctly counts the occurrences of the substring 'std' in a given string `s`. The usage of `s.count('std')` is a built-in method in Python, which accurately counts non-overlapping occurrences of the substring.

The assertions included test various cases, including:
1. A string with multiple occurrences (`'letstdlenstdporstd'`).
2. A string with a single occurrence (`'truststdsolensporsd'`).
3. A string with two non-overlapping occurrences (`'makestdsostdworthit'`).
4. A string that contains the substring exactly once (`'stds'`).
5. An empty string, which should correctly return 0 occurrences (`''`).

All these test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected according to the problem description. Since I can't find any input where the function does not work correctly, the program is considered correct.
