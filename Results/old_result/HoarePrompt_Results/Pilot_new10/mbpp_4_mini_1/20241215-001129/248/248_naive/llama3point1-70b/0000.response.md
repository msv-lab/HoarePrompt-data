Correctness: **True**. 

The function `func_1` correctly takes a list as input and converts it to a tuple using the built-in `tuple()` function. This will work for all types of lists, including those that are empty, contain integers, strings, or even nested lists. There are no edge cases or missing logic since the list can be of any length and any content, which the `tuple()` function can handle appropriately. Thus, the implementation fully meets the requirements of the problem description.
