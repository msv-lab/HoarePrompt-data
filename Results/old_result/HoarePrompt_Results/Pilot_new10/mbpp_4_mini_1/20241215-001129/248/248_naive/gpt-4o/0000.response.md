Correctness: **True**.

The provided function `func_1` correctly converts a list to a tuple as described in the problem statement. It successfully handles the given test cases, and its implementation of `return tuple(lst)` accurately transforms any input list into a tuple format, regardless of its contents. Since I cannot find any edge cases or instances where the function fails to work correctly, I conclude that it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential inputs.
