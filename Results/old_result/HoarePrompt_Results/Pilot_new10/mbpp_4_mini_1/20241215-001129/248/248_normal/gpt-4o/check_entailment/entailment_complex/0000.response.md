Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement, which is to convert a list to a tuple. Here is why the program fulfills the requirements:

1. **Function Definition**: The function `func_1(lst)` takes a single argument `lst`, which is expected to be a list containing elements of any data type.

2. **Return Statement**: The `return tuple(lst)` converts the list `lst` into a tuple. This is the correct operation as specified in the problem description.

3. **Handling of Different Data Types**: The program is capable of handling lists that contain elements of any data type, including integers, strings, floats, and even other collections (like lists or tuples themselves).

4. **Empty List Case**: If an empty list is passed to the function (i.e., `func_1([])`), the output will be an empty tuple `()`, which is also consistent with the behavior described in the problem.

5. **Assertions for Validation**: The program includes assertions that validate the correctness of the function with various test cases, which show that the function produces the expected output for defined inputs.

Since the function accurately converts a list into a tuple for any valid input according to the problem statement, it meets the described requirements.

Thus, the correctness of the program is confirmed as it adheres to the specifications given.
