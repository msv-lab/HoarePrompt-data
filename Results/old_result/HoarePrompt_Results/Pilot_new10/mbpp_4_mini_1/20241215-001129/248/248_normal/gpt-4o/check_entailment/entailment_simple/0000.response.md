Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which requires converting a list to a tuple. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` as input and utilizes the built-in `tuple()` function to convert the list into a tuple. 

The assertions provided serve as test cases that demonstrate the expected behavior of the function. Each test case confirms that the output of `func_1` is a tuple containing the same elements as the input list, regardless of the types of those elements.

Therefore, the program correctly fulfills the requirement of the problem description, ensuring it handles the conversion of lists containing various data types into tuples accurately and consistently.
