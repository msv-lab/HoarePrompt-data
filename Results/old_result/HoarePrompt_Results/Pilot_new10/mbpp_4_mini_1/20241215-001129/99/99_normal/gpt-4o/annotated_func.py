#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of any length.
def func_1(s):
    return ''.join([s[i] for i in range(len(s)) if i % 2 == 0])
    #The program returns a new string composed of characters from the original string 's' at even indices.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and returns a new string comprising characters from `s` that are located at even indices. If `s` is an empty string, the function will return an empty string as well.
