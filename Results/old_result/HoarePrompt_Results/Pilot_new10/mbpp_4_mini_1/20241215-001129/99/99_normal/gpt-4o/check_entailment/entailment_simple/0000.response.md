Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description's requirements. The problem description asks to remove characters that have odd index values from the given string, but the implementation of `func_1` retains the characters at even indices and returns them instead. 

For example, if the input string is "abcdef", the characters at odd indices (1, 3, 5) which would be 'b', 'd', and 'f' should be removed, but the program returns 'ace', which corresponds to the even indices (0, 2, 4) instead. Therefore, the implementation does not satisfy the requirement to remove characters with odd index values, leading to an incorrect outcome.
