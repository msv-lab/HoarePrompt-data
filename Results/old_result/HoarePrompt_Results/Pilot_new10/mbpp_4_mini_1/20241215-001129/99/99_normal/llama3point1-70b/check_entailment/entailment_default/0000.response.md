The provided program is supposed to remove characters from a string that are located at odd index values. The implementation uses string slicing to collect characters from even indices (0, 2, 4, ...) and joins them into a new string.

The output hints confirm that the function returns a new string consisting of every second character from the input string `s`, starting from the first character and returning an empty string if `s` is empty.

After analyzing the problem description, the program seems to correctly meet the requirements. The function effectively collects characters at even indices and handles the case of an empty string properly, returning an empty string as expected.

Thus, we can conclude that the implementation is correct.

Correctness: **True**.
