Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It defines a function `func_1` that takes two tuples as input and returns a new tuple formed by applying the bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements of the two input tuples. 

Specifically, it uses the `zip` function to pair elements from `tup1` and `tup2` based on their index positions. If the tuples are of different lengths, it correctly applies the operation only on the elements that have corresponding pairs, effectively ignoring any extra elements in the longer tuple.

For example:
- Given `tup1 = (1, 2, 3)` and `tup2 = (4, 5)`, the returned tuple will be `(0, 0)` because:
  - `1 & 4 = 0`
  - `2 & 5 = 0`
- The third element from `tup1` (which is `3`) will be ignored since `tup2` has no corresponding third element.

Thus, the function behaves as expected for all possible scenarios, including cases with tuples of different lengths. Therefore, the implementation is correct, and I confirm that the output meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
