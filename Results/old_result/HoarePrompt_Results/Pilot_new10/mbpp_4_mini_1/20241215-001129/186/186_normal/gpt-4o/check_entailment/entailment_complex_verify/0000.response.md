The original assessment claims the program is incorrect based on the ambiguous nature of the problem statement regarding "elementwise and tuples". However, the annotated code clarifies the functionality of `func_1`, which successfully performs a bitwise AND operation on corresponding elements from two valid input tuples. 

Given the annotations:

1. The function is described correctly; it performs the intended operation of returning the bitwise AND of each tuple's corresponding elements.
2. The input assertions provided demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for the given examples.

The main contention of the original assessment seems to stem from the ambiguity in the problem description. However, based on the behavior of the function and the outputs produced by the assertions, it becomes evident that the actual functionality of the program aligns with the operation it's implementing.

Thus, the original assessment that the program is **False** in correctness is not accurate. Therefore, reflecting on the annotations and the behavior of the program:

Final: **True**
