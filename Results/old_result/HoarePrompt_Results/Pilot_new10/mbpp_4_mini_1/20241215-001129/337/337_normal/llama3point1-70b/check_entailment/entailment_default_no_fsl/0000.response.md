Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all potential cases according to the problem description. The main issue is that the function uses the `count` method to check for non-repeated elements in a list. This approach is inefficient because it counts each element's occurrences multiple times, leading to performance issues on large lists. More importantly, for certain input cases, the logic may not yield the expected result.

For example, consider the input list `lst = [1, 2, 2, 3, 3]`. The expected output should be `1`, since the only non-repeated element is `1`. However, if we change the input to `lst = [1, 1, 2, 3, 3]`, the expected output is `2`, as `2` is the only non-repeated number. The function will correctly find and sum such unique entries, but inefficiencies and potential logic errors exist.

Additionally, if the input list is empty or contains all repeated elements, the function should return `0`, which it does per the output hints. However, its reliance on `count` means there could be inefficiencies during execution.

Thus, while the function does offer the correct sum for unique integers per its output hints, the implementation of `count` may lead to poor performance or overlook logic for edge cases in larger lists compared to a direct counting approach with collections. Therefore, it fails to meet the correctness for every potential input case.
