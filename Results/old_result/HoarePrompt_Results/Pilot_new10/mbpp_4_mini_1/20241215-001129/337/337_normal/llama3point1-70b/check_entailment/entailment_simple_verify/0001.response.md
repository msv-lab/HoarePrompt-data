Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately describes the program's logic and confirms its correctness based on the problem description. The annotated code reinforces the understanding that the function computes the sum of all integers in the list that appear exactly once, which aligns with the requirement of summing non-repeated elements. The function behaves as expected for various test cases and handles the edge cases well, further validating the assessment. Therefore, the program is correctly implementing the intended functionality.
