Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description. The task is to find the sum of non-repeated elements in a given list. However, the function `func_1` calculates the sum of all unique elements in the list by using the `set` data structure, which includes all elements that appear at least once, regardless of their repetition.

For example, in the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the elements 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are unique (when considering occurrences), but since the problem specifically asks for non-repeated elements, the correct answer should only include elements that appear exactly once in the list. In this case, 2, 3, 4, 5, and 6 are non-repeated, and their sum is 20 (not 21, as returned by the function).

Therefore, the program does not fulfill the task as specified, leading to incorrect results for cases where there are repeated elements.
