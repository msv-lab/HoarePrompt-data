Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program fails to meet the requirement stated in the problem description. The problem specifically calls for the sum of non-repeated elements, while the program uses `sum(set(lst))` which sums all unique elements in the list instead. For example, for the list `[1, 2, 3, 1, 1, 4, 5, 6]`, the correct sum of non-repeated elements is `20` (from `2`, `3`, `4`, `5`, and `6`), whereas the program incorrectly returns `21`. Since the program does not identify and sum only the non-repeated elements accurately, the original assessment of **False** for correctness is justified.
