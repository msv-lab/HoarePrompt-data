To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to understand the definition of an undulating number. An undulating number is one where its digits alternate between increasing and decreasing. This means that if the digits are in the sequence: 

- from a smaller digit to a larger digit
- then from a larger digit to a smaller digit

and this alternation must continue throughout the number.

Now, let's analyze the provided program:

```python
def func_1(n):
    n = str(n)
    undulating = True
    for i in range(1, len(n) - 1):
        if n[i - 1] < n[i] and n[i] < n[i + 1] or (n[i - 1] > n[i] and n[i] > n[i + 1]):
            pass
        else:
            undulating = False
            break
    return undulating
```

### Points of Analysis:
1. The function converts the number to a string for easier digit comparison.
2. It initializes a boolean variable `undulating` to `True`.
3. It checks the conditions of undulation using the for loop iterating from 1 to `len(n) - 1`.
4. If the condition fails at any point, it sets `undulating` to `False` and breaks out of the loop.
5. Finally, it returns the value of `undulating`.

### Advanced Case Handling:
- The function does not handle cases where the number of digits is less than 3 appropriately. For numbers with less than three digits, it may not be possible to determine if they are undulating, for example:
  - `1` and `22` should be considered undulating because they have no alternate sequence to break.
  - However, `12` is undulating, and `21` is undulating; the program may lack verification for this case.

### Example of a Failing Case:
- Input: `121` (This should return `True` because the digits alternate correctly: 1 < 2 > 1)
  
If we test this:
- `n[0] < n[1]` is true (1 < 2)
- `n[1] > n[2]` is true (2 > 1)
- It will return `True`, which is correct.

Now consider a case like:
- Input: `132` (This is not undulating since `1 < 3` and `3 > 2`, sequentially goes back and forth)
  
The loop checks:
- `n[0] < n[1]` is true,
- `n[1] > n[2]` is also true which is contrary to undulating nature as it maintains the same adjacent nature.

### Conclusion:
The function is not correctly identifying undulating numbers for all cases, particularly when it comes to evaluating adjacent common patterns or when numbers are repeated. It needs adjustments to handle one-digit and two-digit cases more appropriately or should set parameters accordingly.
  
Correctness: **False**.
