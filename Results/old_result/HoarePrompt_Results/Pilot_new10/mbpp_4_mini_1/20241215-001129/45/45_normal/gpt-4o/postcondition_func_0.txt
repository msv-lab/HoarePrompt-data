The function accepts an integer `n` and checks its string representation `s`. It returns `False` if the length of `s` is less than 3 or if the first two digits of `n` are the same. It then checks the remaining characters in `s` ensuring that characters at even indices match the first digit and characters at odd indices match the second digit. If these conditions are met, it returns `True`. If any condition fails, it returns `False`. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs explicitly, which could lead to errors in certain situations.
