Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is at least 100, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the character at index 1 of `s`, and `first_digit` is different from `second_digit`. If `i` is an odd index and `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit`, the function returns False. If `i` is an even index or `s[i]` is equal to `second_digit`, the function does not return any value (or returns None).***
