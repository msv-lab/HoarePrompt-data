You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to check whether the given number is undulating or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
assert func_1(1212121) == True
assert func_1(1991) == False
assert func_1(121) == True

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer.
def func_1(n):
    s = str(n)
    if (len(s) < 3) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, as indicated in the return statement.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer; `s` is the string representation of `n`, and the length of `s` is greater than or equal to 3.
    first_digit = s[0]
    second_digit = s[1]
    if (first_digit == second_digit) :
        return False
        #The program returns False since the current values of 'first_digit' and 'second_digit' are equal.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is an integer; `s` is the string representation of `n`; `first_digit` is the first character of `s`; `second_digit` is the character at index 1 of `s`. The first character of `s` is different from the second character of `s`.
    for i in range(2, len(s)):
        if i % 2 == 0 and s[i] != first_digit:
            return False
        
        if i % 2 == 1 and s[i] != second_digit:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer that is at least 100, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the character at index 1 of `s`, `first_digit` is different from `second_digit`, and all characters in `s` at even indices are equal to `first_digit` while all characters in `s` at odd indices are equal to `second_digit`.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the conditions about the structure of the integer 'n', represented as a string 's', are met.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and checks its string representation `s`. It returns `False` if the length of `s` is less than 3 or if the first two digits of `n` are the same. It then checks the remaining characters in `s` ensuring that characters at even indices match the first digit and characters at odd indices match the second digit. If these conditions are met, it returns `True`. If any condition fails, it returns `False`. The function does not handle negative integers or non-integer inputs explicitly, which could lead to errors in certain situations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
