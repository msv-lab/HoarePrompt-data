The original assessment correctly identified a major issue with the function `func_1`: it does not accurately determine if a number is undulating for all valid cases. The assessment correctly points out that the function wrongly identifies certain numbers—specifically, numbers like `20202`—as undulating when they actually do not alternate properly. 

Additionally, the output hints provide a summary of the function's behavior, including conditions under which it returns `False`. The hints confirm that the function does not explicitly handle negative integers or non-integer inputs, but these aspects do not invalidate the correctness of the function given the assumption of valid integer input. 

Therefore, taking all this into account, the conclusion remains that the program does not comply with the problem description in all edge cases, and thus, the original assessment was accurate.

Final: **False**.
