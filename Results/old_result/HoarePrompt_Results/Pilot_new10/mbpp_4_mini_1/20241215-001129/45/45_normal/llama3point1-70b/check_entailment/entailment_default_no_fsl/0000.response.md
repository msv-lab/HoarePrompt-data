Correctness: **False**

The program claims to check if the digits of a number undulate, meaning that each digit must either be greater than or less than its neighboring digits. However, according to the output hints, the function fails to specify the behavior for numbers with fewer than 3 digits. While the logical structure of the function appears sound for numbers that do have at least 3 digits, it does not return a well-defined response for 1 or 2 digit numbers.

For instance:
- `func_1(12)` and `func_1(5)` would not enter the loop and would implicitly return `True` because there are not enough digits to evaluate the undulating condition. This is not according to the problem definition that seems to imply at least 3 digits are needed to consider the undulation.

Therefore, the program does not cover all potential cases effectively, leading to ambiguity in its output when dealing with numbers having fewer than 3 digits.
