Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer that is at least 100, `s` is the string representation of `n`, `first_digit` is the first character of `s`, `second_digit` is the character at index 1 of `s`, `first_digit` is different from `second_digit`, and `i` is some integer less than `len(s) - 1`. If `i` is odd and `s[i]` is not equal to `second_digit`, the function returns False. Otherwise, no value is returned.***
