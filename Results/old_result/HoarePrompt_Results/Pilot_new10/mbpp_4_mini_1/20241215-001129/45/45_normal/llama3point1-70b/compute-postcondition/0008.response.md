Postcondition: ***`n` is a string representation of a positive integer with at least two digits. If the character at index `i` is either greater than both its neighbors or less than both of its neighbors, the condition is met. If this condition is not met, `undulating` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
