Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate because the program does not correctly implement sorting. The use of an undefined global variable `arr` within `find_max_index` leads to a `NameError`. Additionally, the sorting logic itself appears incomplete for the intended sorting order (which is assumed to be increasing) based on the problem description. Specifically, the program implements a flipping mechanism similar to pancake sorting, but it is flawed as it does not effectively sort the list as required. The output hints further reinforce these issues, particularly the mention of potential failure cases when calling `func_1`. Thus, the program is not correct based on the problem description.
