The code executes a slice of the list `arr` up to `max_index + 1` and reverses that portion of the list. The initial state indicates that `max_index` points to the maximum element in the list's relevant subsection (`arr[:size]`), and the list will change accordingly. The `size` is decremented, but since we only need to report changes, we will consider only the relevant modifications.

Since `arr` has its elements reversed for the slice `arr[:max_index + 1]`, the contents of that segment of the list change, but we do not know the specific values, just that they are reversed. Therefore, the output reflects the state of the list and the decremented size.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared and the first `max_index + 1` elements are reversed; `max_index` is the index of the maximum element in `arr[:size]`; `n` is greater than 0; `size` is decremented to the next value.**
