Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared, `max_index` is the index of the first element of `arr`, `n` remains greater than 0, `size` is 1, and if `max_index` is not equal to 0, then the sublist `arr[:max_index + 1]` is reversed. If `max_index` is 0, no changes are made to `arr`.***
