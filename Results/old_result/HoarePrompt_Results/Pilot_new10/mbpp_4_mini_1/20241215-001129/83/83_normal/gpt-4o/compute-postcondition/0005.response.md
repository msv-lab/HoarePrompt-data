According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the loop variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop is set to run while `i` is in the range from 1 to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is at least 2, meaning that the loop has the potential to iterate again if `i` is less than `n - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1, which will make `i` equal to 2. Additionally, since `n` is at least 2, `n` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `max_index` is 0, `i` is 2**
