Final: **False**

The original assessment is accurate in pointing out the shortcomings of the function `func_1`. The function is designed to sort a list, but it only sorts it in non-ascending order (i.e., from largest to smallest), which does not align with the typical expectation of a sorting function that should sort in non-descending order (smallest to largest). Additionally, the reversal logic can lead to incorrect placements of elements, especially in cases with varying distributions of maximum values and duplicates. Thus, despite the program correctly sorting in a non-ascending manner, it does not fulfill the requirement of sorting a list of elements in the generic sense.
