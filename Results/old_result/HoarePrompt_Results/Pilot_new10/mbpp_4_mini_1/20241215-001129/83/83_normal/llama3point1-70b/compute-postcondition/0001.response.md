According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The `for` loop iterates starting from `n` down to 1, inclusive. For the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be at least 1. The variable `size` should also be initialized with the starting value of `n`. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, the following conditions need to be satisfied: `arr` should be a list of elements that can be compared, `n` must be greater than 0, and `size` should be equal to `n` at the start.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements that can be compared, `n` must be greater than 0, `size` is `n`**
