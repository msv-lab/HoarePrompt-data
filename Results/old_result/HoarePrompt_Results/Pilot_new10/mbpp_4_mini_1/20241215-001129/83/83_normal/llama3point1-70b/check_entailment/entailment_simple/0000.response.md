Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The problem description requires the function to sort a list of elements. However, the provided program sorts the list in non-ascending order (i.e., descending order), rather than in ascending order. Since the program does not fulfill the requirement specified in the problem description to sort the list, it does not meet the criteria for correctness. 

Therefore, it is incorrect because the output does not correspond to a standard sorting behavior (ascending) that the problem description implies.
