Correctness: **False**.

The function `func_1` aims to sort a list of elements using a selection sort-like method by repeatedly reversing segments of the list. However, there are multiple issues with the implementation that can result in incorrect sorting:

1. **Ineffective Index Retrieval**: The line `max_index = arr.index(max(arr[:size]))` retrieves the index of the maximum value correctly, but if there are duplicate maximum values in the list, it will always return the index of the first occurrence. This means the algorithm could mishandle the sorting of lists that contain identical maximum elements.

2. **Improper Handling of Reverse Logic**: The reversal logic is incorrect in the context of sorting:
   - The line `arr[:size] = arr[:size][::-1]` can place elements in an incorrect order. It doesn't guarantee that after reversing the segment, the full list remains sorted.

3. **Edge Cases**: The function might not handle edge cases properly:
   - An empty list `[]` or a single-element list `[1]` should simply return as is, and the current logic does not explicitly handle these cases.

For example, given the input `arr = [3, 1, 2, 3]`, the output from `func_1(arr)` would not produce a correctly sorted list. Thus, the functionality of sorting does not hold under all potential cases.

Therefore, since there are cases where the program does not work correctly, the overall correctness is marked as false.
