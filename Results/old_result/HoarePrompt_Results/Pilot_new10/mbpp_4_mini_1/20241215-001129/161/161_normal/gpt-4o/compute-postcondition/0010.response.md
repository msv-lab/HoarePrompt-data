The code snippet assigns values to `a` and `b` based on the previous values of these variables. Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `a` and `b`, we recognize from the code that:

- `b` is assigned the previous value of `a`
- `a` is assigned the sum of its previous value and the previous value of `b`

Since `b` is assigned to the original value of `a`, and `a` is updated to the sum of the original `a` and `b`, we can summarize the states as follows:

- If we assume `a` is `0` (for simplicity, as it can be any integer), then `b` would be `0` after the assignment in the second place, making `a` equal `3` after the operation.

Therefore, the output state remains:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, _ is 3, and after the assignment, `a` equals `a + b` and `b` equals the original value of `a`.**
