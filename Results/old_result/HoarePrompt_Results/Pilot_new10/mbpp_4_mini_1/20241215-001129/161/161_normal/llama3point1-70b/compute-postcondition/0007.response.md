According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop executes for values in the range from 2 to `n + 1`. Since `n` is specified to be a non-negative integer greater than 0 and not equal to 1, this means `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to have any iterations. Therefore, `n` is valid and will allow for the loop to execute, starting from 2.

At the beginning of the loop, the current iteration variable `_` will take values starting from 2 up to and including `n`. Therefore, we can assert that `_` starts at 2 for the first iteration.

Since no additional variables are affected within the loop before it starts, we only need to detail the values of `n` and `_`.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `_` is 2**
