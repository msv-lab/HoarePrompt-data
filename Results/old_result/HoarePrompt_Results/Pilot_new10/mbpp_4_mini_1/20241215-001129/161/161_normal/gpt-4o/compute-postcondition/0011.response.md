According to the code, the loop iterates from 2 to `n + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3 because the end of the last iteration had `_` set to 3. The next value of `_` will be 4. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` must be greater than 2, and since `_` is 3, for the loop to continue to execute, `n` must now be greater than 4.

State: **`n` must be greater than 4, _ is 4, a equals a + b, b equals the original value of a**
