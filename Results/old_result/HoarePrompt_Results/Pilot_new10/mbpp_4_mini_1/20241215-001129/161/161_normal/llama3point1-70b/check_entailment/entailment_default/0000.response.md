The program provided defines a function `func_1(n)` that is intended to calculate the n-th Lucas number. The Lucas numbers are defined as follows:

- L(0) = 2
- L(1) = 1
- For n ≥ 2, L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2)

Let's evaluate the code against the problem description:

1. **Base Cases**:
   - If `n == 0`, the function correctly returns `2`, which is accurate according to the Lucas number definition.
   - If `n == 1`, the function correctly returns `1`, again matching the definition.

2. **Iteration for n ≥ 2**:
   - For values of `n` greater than 1, the function initializes `a` as 2 (corresponding to L(0)) and `b` as 1 (corresponding to L(1)).
   - The for loop correctly iterates from 2 to `n`, updating `a` and `b` to compute the next Lucas number based on the previous two.

However, there is a critical mistake in the output hints that needs to be addressed: The output hints inaccurately state that the program returns the n-th Fibonacci number for `n > 1`, which is incorrect. It mentions that the sequence starts from Fibonacci sequence values which is misleading; the function is supposed to calculate Lucas numbers, not Fibonacci numbers.

Thus, even though the function is technically calculating Lucas numbers correctly, the description in the output hints introduces confusion and suggests that it is computing something else entirely (namely, Fibonacci numbers). 

There are no edge cases where the program fails to compute the Lucas number correctly, as it handles all specified inputs as intended. Consequently, if we strictly adhere to whether the program meets the requirements defined in the problem description (which is to find the n-th Lucas number), we can conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly computes the n-th Lucas number for all non-negative integers `n`: it returns `2` for `n=0`, `1` for `n=1`, and calculates the subsequent Lucas numbers correctly. However, it's important to note that output hints should have accurately described the functionality to avoid any confusion about it calculating Fibonacci numbers.
