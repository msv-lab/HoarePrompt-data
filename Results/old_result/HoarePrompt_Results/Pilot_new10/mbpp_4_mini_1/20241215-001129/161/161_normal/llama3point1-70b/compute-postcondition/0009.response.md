According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `_` and `n`. The loop starts at 2 and ends at `n + 1`, meaning that for the loop to execute one more time, `_` must be less than `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2 and `n` is greater than 1. Since the loop increments `_` by 1 each iteration, `_` will become 3 in the next iteration. For the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 3, `_` is 3, `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` takes the value of `a + b`.**
