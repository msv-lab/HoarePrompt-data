The original assessment accurately states that the function `func_1` does not compute Lucas numbers correctly. The output hints reinforce this assessment by indicating that the function calculates and returns Fibonacci numbers rather than the correct Lucas numbers.

In detail:
- The Lucas number sequence is defined as:
  - L(0) = 2
  - L(1) = 1
  - L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n >= 2
  
The program starts correctly for the base cases:
- Returns `2` for `n = 0`
- Returns `1` for `n = 1`

However, for `n >= 2`, the function does not follow the correct formula and instead uses the Fibonacci rule, which leads to incorrect results. 

For instance, the output hint explicitly states the function returns the nth Fibonacci number rather than the Lucas number, which confirms the original assessment's claim of the function's incorrectness.

Thus, the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description and the reasoning provided in the original assessment remains valid. 

Final: **False**
