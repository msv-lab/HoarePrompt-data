The original assessment correctly identified the function's failure to handle all possible inputs adequately, particularly noting that it does not assert the correct output for `n = 2`, which should return 3. However, the annotated version clarifies that the function only processes non-negative integers, and we are given the assumption that the input will always be valid, thus negating concerns about negative inputs.

Moreover, the annotator mistakenly categorized the return value from the Lucas number calculation as Fibonacci numbers in its comments. Even though it states that the function returns the n-th "Fibonacci" number starting from the sequence (2, 1), it is actually calculating the n-th Lucas number, as clearly defined in the problem. Despite this misleading annotation, the return value for valid inputs still aligns with the definition of Lucas numbers.

Ultimately, since the context specifies that inputs will be valid and handled appropriately, the function correctly returns the expected Lucas numbers for all tested cases. The distinction about not covering input for `n=2` is less impactful given our assumption about input validity.

Thus, the original assessment is not entirely accurate as it could give the false impression that the function is incorrect when, under the defined assumptions, it works correctly for all valid inputs.

Final: **True**
