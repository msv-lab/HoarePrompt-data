Correctness: **False**. 

Explanation: The program is intended to compute the n-th Lucas number, which is defined as follows: L(0) = 2, L(1) = 1, and L(n) = L(n-1) + L(n-2) for n > 1. The initial cases handled by the code (for n = 0 and n = 1) are correct. However, when the code progresses to computing L(n) for n > 1, it does not correctly maintain the sequence of Lucas numbers. The implementation mistakenly follows a Fibonacci sequence logic instead of a Lucas sequence owing to the incorrect ordering of variable updates. The output hints incorrectly state that the function returns the n-th Fibonacci number starting from the sequence (2, 1) for n greater than 1, which is not correct as these are Lucas numbers, not Fibonacci numbers. Therefore, there are cases, such as L(2), L(5), etc., where the program will yield incorrect results. This discrepancy from the problem description indicates that the code is indeed incorrect.
