The loop calculates the Fibonacci-like sequence starting from the initial values of `a` and `b`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, the loop will execute `n - 1` times, updating `a` and `b` on each iteration.

- After 1 iteration, `_` will be 2, `a` will take the value of `b` (which is 1), and `b` will become 3 (the sum of the previous `a` and `b`).
- After 2 iterations, `_` will be 3, `a` will have the value of 1 (the value of `b` from the previous iteration), and `b` will have the value of 2 (the sum of the previous `a` and `b`).
- After 3 iterations, `_` will be 4, `a` will have the value of 2, and `b` will have the value of 3.

Continuing this for `n - 1` iterations will lead to the final values based on the Fibonacci-like sequence, where:

- The final output of `a` will be the `(n-1)`th term of this updated sequence.
- The final value of `b` will be the `n`th term of the sequence initiated from `a = 2` and `b = 1`, following the recurrence.

After `n - 1` iterations, the final state will be aligned with the formulas derived from the Fibonacci-like relationship of `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output state of the loop after all iterations will be:

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 1, `a` is the (n-1)th Fibonacci number starting with `a=2` and `b=1, `b` is the nth Fibonacci number starting with `a=2` and `b=1.**
