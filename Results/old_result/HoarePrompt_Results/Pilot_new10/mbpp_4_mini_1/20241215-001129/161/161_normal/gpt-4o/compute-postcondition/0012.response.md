To analyze the given code snippet `a, b = b, a + b` based on the initial state, letâ€™s break it down step by step:

Initial State: `n` must be greater than 4, `_` is 4, `a` equals `a + b`, `b` equals the original value of `a`.

1. The original value of `b` is equal to the original value of `a`.
2. The operation `a, b = b, a + b` assigns values to `a` and `b` simultaneously:
   - The right side of the equation is evaluated first. 
   - `b` takes its original value (prior to the assignment), and `a + b` evaluates to the sum of the updated `a` and original `b`.
3. After this operation, `a` now holds the value of the previous `b`, and `b` holds the value of the previous `a` plus the original `b`.

However, since we don't have the specific initial values for `a` and `b`, we describe the output state based on the relationships and operations performed:

- `a` becomes equal to its original value of `b` (the original value of `a`), which we can label as `b_old`.
- `b` will be the updated value as the sum of the original values of `a` and `b`.

Therefore, the output state retains the relationship between `a` and `b` while describing the values in terms of their original values.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `_` is 4, `a` is equal to the original value of `b`, `b` is equal to the sum of the original values of `a` and `b` (previous values are denoted as `a_old` and `b_old`).**
