The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists that may contain elements of any data type. After executing the function body, it returns a tuple containing the elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`, sorted in ascending order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a tuple of the common elements between the two lists, sorted in ascending order. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a tuple containing the elements present in both lists, sorted in ascending order.**
