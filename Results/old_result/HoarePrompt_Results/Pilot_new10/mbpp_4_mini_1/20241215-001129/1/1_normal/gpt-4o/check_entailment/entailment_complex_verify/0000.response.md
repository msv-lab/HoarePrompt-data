Final: **True** 

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists, as required by the problem description. The function `func_1` effectively utilizes set intersection to find common elements and returns them as a sorted tuple. The annotations confirm that the function handles the inputs correctly and defines the expected return behavior clearly, including cases with no common elements. Given the valid assumptions about input types and the function's operations, the program can be deemed correct overall.
