Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes two inputs, `list1` and `list2`, and computes the intersection of the two lists by converting them into sets and using the `&` operator. It then returns the common elements as a sorted tuple. 

The output hints indicate that the function will return a tuple of common elements sorted in ascending order and that it will return an empty tuple if there are no common elements. Upon reviewing the provided examples, the function behaves as expected in those cases. 

It handles multiple data types since Python sets work with any hashable type, ensuring that the function meets the stated requirements. Given that we cannot find any potential cases where the function does not meet the requirements, we conclude it is correct.
