Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly identifies the shared elements between two lists by leveraging the set intersection operation. It addresses all typical cases as noted in the assessment, such as handling duplicates, empty lists, and lists with unique but comparable elements. The output hints also reinforce that the function is designed to return an empty tuple under two scenarios: if either list is empty or if there are no common elements. Since the code fulfills the problem description and behaves as expected in all mentioned cases, I conclude that the program is indeed correct.
