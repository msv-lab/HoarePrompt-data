Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements a function to find the shared elements between two lists as described in the problem statement. 

Here's the explanation of why the code is correct:

1. **Input Handling**: The function `func_1` takes two lists (or tuples, as in the assertions) as inputs.
2. **Common Elements**: It computes the intersection of the two input lists using the set intersection operator `&`, which efficiently finds common elements.
3. **Sorting and Output**: The common elements are then sorted and converted back to a tuple, ensuring that the output is in ascending order.
4. **Empty Case Handling**: If there are no common elements, the intersection will result in an empty set, and the sorted conversion will yield an empty tuple, which is the expected behavior.
5. **Variety of Data Types**: The function handles elements of any data type, which is consistent with the output hints.

The assertions provided in the program serve as tests that verify the correctness for specific cases, and since there are no indications of missing logic or edge cases in the output hints or the assertions, I conclude that the program functions as intended.

Hence, the code is correct in meeting the problem's requirements.
