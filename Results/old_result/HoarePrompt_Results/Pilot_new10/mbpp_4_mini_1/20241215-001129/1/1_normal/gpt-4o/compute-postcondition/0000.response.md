The variable `common_elements` is assigned the value of the intersection between the sets created from `list1` and `list2`. This means that `common_elements` will now hold only those elements that appear in both lists. The states of `list1` and `list2` are not affected by this code, and they may contain any elements of any data type. 

Output State: **`list1` is a list containing elements of any data type, `list2` is a list containing elements of any data type, `common_elements` is a set with elements that are present in both `list1` and `list2`.**
