Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly flattens nested lists by recursively checking each item in the input `nested_list`. When the item is a list, it calls itself to flatten that list and extends the `flat_list` with the result. If the item is not a list, it appends it directly to `flat_list`. 

The program handles the example assertions correctly:
- The first assertion tests a mixed nested list and returns a correctly flattened list.
- The second assertion combines multiple lists while preserving the order, and it too returns the correct result.
- The third assertion checks a list of lists with multiple elements, and it successfully flattens them.

Given the recursive structure, it should also handle other cases, including deeply nested lists, empty lists, and lists containing mixed data types (e.g., strings, integers). Therefore, no potential edge case can break the logic based on the current implementation.
