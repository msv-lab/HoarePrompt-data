`flat_list` gets a new element appended to it, which is `item`, the next item in the `nested_list`. The variable `nested_list` remains valid, as it is still a non-empty list containing at least one more item. The variable `item` now represents this additional item. Therefore, the Output State reflects the modified state and the unchanged information about `nested_list`:

Output State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list with at least one more item; `flat_list` has an additional item appended.**
