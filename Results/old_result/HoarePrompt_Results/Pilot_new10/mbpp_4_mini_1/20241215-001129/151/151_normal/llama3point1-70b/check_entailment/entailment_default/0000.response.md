Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic needed to flatten a nested list. It checks each element in `nested_list`. If the element is a list, it recursively calls itself to flatten that list and extends `flat_list` with the results. If the element is not a list (i.e., it is an integer), it simply appends that element to `flat_list`. This means that all integers from any level of nesting will be included in the final flat list. 

Moreover, if `nested_list` is empty or does not contain any integers, the function will return an empty list, which aligns with the output hints provided. The recursive nature of the function allows it to handle lists nested to any depth. Therefore, the program fulfills the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
