To determine the necessary states for the for loop to execute, we need to consider the `nested_list`. The loop intends to iterate over each element contained within `nested_list`. For the loop to execute at least once, `nested_list` must contain at least one element.

Given that `flat_list` is currently empty, its state does not affect the loop execution but will likely be modified within the loop body.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we summarize the required adjustments as follows:

State: **`nested_list` is a list that must contain at least 1 element, `i` is the first element of `nested_list`**
