The code initializes `flat_list` as an empty list. The `nested_list` remains unchanged but maintains its original state, which is a list that may contain other lists or non-list elements. As a result, the other variables' states are unaffected by this specific operation.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain other lists or non-list elements; `flat_list` is an empty list.**
