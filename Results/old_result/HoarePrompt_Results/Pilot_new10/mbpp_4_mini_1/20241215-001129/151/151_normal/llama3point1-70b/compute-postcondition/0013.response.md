The value of `i` is appended to the list `flat_list`. The `nested_list` remains unchanged, but `flat_list` now contains an additional element which is the current value of `i`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list that contains at least 3 elements, `flat_list` is modified to include one more element which is equal to `i`, and `i` remains as the next element in the list.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 3 elements, `flat_list` is modified to include one more element which is equal to `i`, and `i` is the next element in the list.**
