According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. Since `nested_list` is a non-empty list, the loop will execute as long as there are more items in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, `item` holds the current element being processed from `nested_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least one more item.

If `item` is a list, then `flat_list` includes the contents returned by `func_1(item)`, indicating that the next item would be processed shortly. 

To prepare for the next iteration, we need to ensure that the loop index (implicitly managed by the for loop) continues to point to the next item in `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list with at least 1 more item, `item` is the next item in the `nested_list`**
