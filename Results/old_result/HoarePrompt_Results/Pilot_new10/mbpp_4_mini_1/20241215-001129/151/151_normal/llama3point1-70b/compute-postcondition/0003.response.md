To analyze the given code snippet, we first consider the initial state where `nested_list` contains at least one element and `i` is the first element of `nested_list`, which itself is a list. The code involves extending a list called `flat_list` by adding elements resulting from a function `func_1(i)`.

- `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(i)`.
- The variable `i` is equal to the first element of `nested_list`, which is a list. We assume that `func_1(i)` will return a flat version or a transformation of this list `i`.

Since `flat_list` would be modified by adding the elements returned by `func_1(i)` and `i` holds the value of the first element of `nested_list`, we need to acknowledge these changes while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Considering this, the key remaining information is that `nested_list` has at least one element, and now we describe how `flat_list` has been updated based on `func_1(i)`.

Output State: **`nested_list` contains at least 1 element; `i` is the first element of `nested_list` and is a list; `flat_list` is updated to extend with elements from `func_1(i)`.**
