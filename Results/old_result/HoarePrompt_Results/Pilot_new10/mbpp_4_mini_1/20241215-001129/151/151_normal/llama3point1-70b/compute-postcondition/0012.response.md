The value of `flat_list` is modified by extending it with the result of `func_1(i)`. The value of `i` represents the next element in the `nested_list`, and `func_1(i)` presumably processes `i` and returns a new list based on it. Since the initial state indicates that `nested_list` contains at least three elements, the value of `i` can be assumed to be the next element from this list. The condition of `flat_list` being accordingly modified indicates that new elements are added based on the function's output.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that contains at least 3 elements; `flat_list` is modified by appending the result of `func_1(i)` and `i` is the next element of `nested_list`.**
