To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, I need to analyze the functionality of the `func_1` function as it relates to the problem description: finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The function initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to the last index of the array.
   - `result` is initially set to `-1`, which indicates that the number has not yet been found.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The function uses a while loop to perform binary search as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - It calculates the middle index `mid` using `(low + high) // 2`.
   - If the element at index `mid` equals the target, it updates `result` with `mid`, then continues to search to the left by setting `high` to `mid - 1`. This is the critical step that ensures it finds the first occurrence of the target.
   - If the element at `mid` is less than the target, it modifies `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the upper half.
   - If the element at `mid` is greater than the target, it modifies `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the lower half.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the `result`, which is either the index of the first occurrence of the target or `-1` if the target is not found.

### Test Cases Evaluation

The provided assertions test the function with the following conditions:
- The first occurrence of `5` in `[2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` is at index `1`, which is correct.
- The first occurrence of `5` in `[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` is at index `2`, which is also correct.
- The first occurrence of `6` in `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` is at index `4`, which again is correct.

### Edge Cases

To further verify the correctness, I can think of other edge cases:
1. **Empty Array**: `func_1([], 5)` should return `-1` since the array is empty.
2. **Number Not Present**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)` should return `-1` since `6` is not in the array.
3. **First Element Target**: `func_1([1, 1, 1, 1, 2], 1)` should return `0` as the first occurrence of `1` is at index `0`.
4. **Last Element Target**: `func_1([1, 1, 1, 1, 2], 2)` should return `4` as the first occurrence of `2` is at index `4`.

### Conclusion

The provided function handles these cases correctly and follows the problem statement entirely. Therefore, as I cannot find any examples where the function fails to do what is described, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The function correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array according to the problem statement.
