Based on the problem description, the function `func_1` is intended to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. The original assessment correctly outlines the implementation strategy of the `func_1` function:

1. It correctly identifies the method of binary search to locate the target value.
2. It properly implements the logic to ensure it finds the first occurrence by continuing to search to the left when a match is found.
3. The test cases that were evaluated demonstrate that the function behaves as expected in those scenarios.

However, the original assessment identified a potential issue regarding handling an empty input array, leading to the conclusion of the program's correctness being marked as **False**. Despite this, it is important to note that the instructions assume valid input and do not consider handling inputs outside of that scope as an error.

The annotations also state that the result will be `-1` when the target is not found but does not necessarily refer to an empty array situation, which aligns with the assumption of valid user input.

Given these considerations, the original assessment's conclusion is overly cautious given the assumptions of valid inputs. The behavior of returning `-1` for a missing target is technically correct under the assumed conditions, and does not violate the requirements laid out in the problem description.

Thus, the function correctly implements the expected behavior based on the given sorted array and target number.

Final: **True**
