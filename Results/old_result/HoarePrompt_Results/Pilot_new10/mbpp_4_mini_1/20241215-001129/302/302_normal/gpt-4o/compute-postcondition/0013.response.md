Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer. If `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, then `result` is set to `mid`, `low` is 0, `high` is now `mid - 1`, and `mid` is recalculated. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, `low` is updated to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2 + 1` while `high` remains `len(arr) - 1`, and `result` remains -1; `mid` is recalculated. If `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`, `high` is updated to `mid - 1` while `low` remains 0, `result` stays -1, and `mid` is recalculated.***
