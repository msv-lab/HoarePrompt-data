Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array using a binary search algorithm. The while loop continues until `low` exceeds `high`, and upon finding the target, it updates `result` while adjusting `high` to continue searching towards the left side of the array. This ensures that the first occurrence is found even if there are multiple instances of the target. If the target does not exist in the array, the function accurately returns -1. All provided test cases confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs. The output hints also align well with the code's functionality, accurately describing its operation. Since the code meets the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, it is correct.
