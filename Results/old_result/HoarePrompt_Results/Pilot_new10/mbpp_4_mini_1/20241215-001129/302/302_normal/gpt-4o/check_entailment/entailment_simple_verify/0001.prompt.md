You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array.
Program:
```
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

def func_1(arr, target):
    (low, high) = (0, len(arr) - 1)
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
    return result


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, I need to analyze the functionality of the `func_1` function as it relates to the problem description: finding the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. 

Here's a breakdown of the function:

1. **Initialization**: 
   - The function initializes `low` to `0` and `high` to the last index of the array.
   - `result` is initially set to `-1`, which indicates that the number has not yet been found.

2. **Binary Search Logic**:
   - The function uses a while loop to perform binary search as long as `low` is less than or equal to `high`.
   - It calculates the middle index `mid` using `(low + high) // 2`.
   - If the element at index `mid` equals the target, it updates `result` with `mid`, then continues to search to the left by setting `high` to `mid - 1`. This is the critical step that ensures it finds the first occurrence of the target.
   - If the element at `mid` is less than the target, it modifies `low` to `mid + 1` to search in the upper half.
   - If the element at `mid` is greater than the target, it modifies `high` to `mid - 1` to search in the lower half.

3. **Return Value**:
   - The function returns the `result`, which is either the index of the first occurrence of the target or `-1` if the target is not found.

### Test Cases Evaluation

The provided assertions test the function with the following conditions:
- The first occurrence of `5` in `[2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` is at index `1`, which is correct.
- The first occurrence of `5` in `[2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` is at index `2`, which is also correct.
- The first occurrence of `6` in `[1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9]` is at index `4`, which again is correct.

### Edge Cases

To further verify the correctness, I can think of other edge cases:
1. **Empty Array**: `func_1([], 5)` should return `-1` since the array is empty.
2. **Number Not Present**: `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5], 6)` should return `-1` since `6` is not in the array.
3. **First Element Target**: `func_1([1, 1, 1, 1, 2], 1)` should return `0` as the first occurrence of `1` is at index `0`.
4. **Last Element Target**: `func_1([1, 1, 1, 1, 2], 2)` should return `4` as the first occurrence of `2` is at index `4`.

### Conclusion

The provided function handles these cases correctly and follows the problem statement entirely. Therefore, as I cannot find any examples where the function fails to do what is described, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The function correctly finds the index of the first occurrence of a number in a sorted array according to the problem statement.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 1
assert func_1([2, 3, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5) == 2
assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 6) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: arr is a list of integers in sorted order, and target is an integer.
def func_1(arr, target):
    low, high = 0, len(arr) - 1
    result = -1
    while low <= high:
        mid = (low + high) // 2
        
        if arr[mid] == target:
            result = mid
            high = mid - 1
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            low = mid + 1
        else:
            high = mid - 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `low` is greater than `high`, `result` is the index of the first occurrence of `target` in `arr` if `target` exists in `arr`; otherwise, `result` remains -1. If `target` is not found, `low` is equal to the position in `arr` where `target` would be if it were inserted while maintaining sorted order.
    return result
    #The program returns the index of the first occurrence of 'target' in 'arr' if 'target' exists; otherwise, it returns -1, and if 'target' is not found, 'low' is equal to the position in 'arr' where 'target' would be inserted while maintaining sorted order.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
