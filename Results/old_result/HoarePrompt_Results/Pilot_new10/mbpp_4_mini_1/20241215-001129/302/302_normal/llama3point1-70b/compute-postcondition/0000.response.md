According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the `arr`. For the loop to execute, `arr` must contain at least one element. The `i` will start at 0 (the index of the first element), and `x` will be the first element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a sorted list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in `arr`**
