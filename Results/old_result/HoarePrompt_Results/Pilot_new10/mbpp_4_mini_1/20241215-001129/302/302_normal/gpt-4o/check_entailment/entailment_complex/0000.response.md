Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the problem description requirements because while it finds the index of a given number in a sorted array using binary search, it fails to return the correct index of the first occurrence of that number if there are duplicates.

In the provided assertions, the expected results suggest that the function should return the index of the first occurrence of the target number. However, the code simply continues updating the result variable when it finds the target at any index, and it only returns the last found index that matches the target. This will lead to incorrect results in cases where the target appears multiple times.

For example, given the input `func_1([2, 5, 5, 5, 6, 6, 8, 9, 9, 9], 5)`, the function will eventually set `result` to 2 (the last occurrence of `5` before it finds `6`); thus, in scenarios with duplicates, it does not necessarily yield the first occurrence index, which is what the problem description specifically requires.

Therefore, the program could return -1 or an incorrect index when a number has multiple occurrences before returning the first found position.

To meet the problem description, the program must ensure that it returns the first occurrence index of the target in all cases where the number exists in the array.
