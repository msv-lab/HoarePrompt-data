Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, and `low` remains less than or equal to `high`. If `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`, then `result` equals `mid` and `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. If `arr[mid]` is less than `target`, then `low` is updated to `mid + 1`. If `arr[mid]` is greater than or equal to `target`, then `high` is updated to `mid - 1`, while `mid` remains equal to `(low + high) // 2`.***
