Final: **True**

The original assessment was found to be inaccurate. The program correctly identifies the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array, including scenarios with duplicates, absence of the number, and valid handling of sorted inputs. The code uses a linear search which is appropriate for this problem, and the output hints confirm that the expected behavior aligns with the problem description. Thus, the function meets the requirements specified, leading to the conclusion that the program is correct.
