Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements a function to find the index of the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array. Here's why it adheres to the requirements described in the problem statement:

1. **Binary Search Logic**: The implementation uses a binary search approach, which is efficient for sorted arrays. It maintains two pointers, `low` and `high`, to narrow down the search space.

2. **Finding First Occurrence**: Upon finding the target value (`arr[mid] == target`), the function does not stop the search immediately. Instead, it updates `result` with the current `mid` index and continues to search in the left half of the array (by setting `high = mid - 1`). This ensures that if there are duplicate occurrences of the target, the function will find the index of the first occurrence.

3. **Return Value**: The function returns the correct index of the first occurrence of the target if found. If the target is not present in the array, the function correctly returns `-1`.

4. **Test Cases**: The assertions provided show that the function produces the expected results for multiple scenarios, confirming both the presence and absence of the target value.

Given these points, the program consistently performs as required by the problem description. Thus, it is correct.
