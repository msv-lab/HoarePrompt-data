The variable `result` is assigned the value of `-1`. The values of `arr`, `target`, `low`, and `high` remain unchanged, as the assignment of `-1` to `result` does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1, and `result` is -1.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1, `result` is -1**.
