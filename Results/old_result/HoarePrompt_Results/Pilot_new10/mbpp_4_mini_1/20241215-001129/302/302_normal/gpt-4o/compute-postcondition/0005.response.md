The value of `result` is assigned the value of `mid`, which is the index of the middle element of the sorted list `arr` and currently equal to the `target`. Thus, the state of `result` changes, but the states of the other variables remain the same. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to `len(arr) - 1`, `result` is equal to `mid`, `mid` is equal to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, and the current value of `arr[mid]` is equal to `target`.**
