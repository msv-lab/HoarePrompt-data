The value of `high` is updated to `mid - 1`. Prior to this update, we know that `mid` is already defined as `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, and since it is given that the element at index `mid` in `arr` is greater than or equal to `target`, we can determine that `high` will now be less than the previous value. The other variables retain their previous values as they are unaffected by this assignment.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of integers in sorted order, `target` is an integer, `low` is 0, `high` is equal to `mid - 1`, `result` is -1, `mid` is equal to `(len(arr) - 1) // 2`, and the element at index `mid` in `arr` is not equal to `target`, and it is greater than or equal to `target`.**
