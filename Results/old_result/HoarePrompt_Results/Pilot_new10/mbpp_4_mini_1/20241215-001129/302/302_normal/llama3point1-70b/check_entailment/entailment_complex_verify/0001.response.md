Final: **True**

The original assessment's correctness conclusion was based on a misunderstanding of the problem requirements. The program correctly implements the requirement to find the first occurrence of a given number in a sorted array, returning -1 for an empty array or when the number is not found. The annotations clarify that the function returns the index of the first occurrence when it is present, which aligns with the problem description. 

While it is true that the function does not leverage the sorted nature of the array for optimization, the problem description specifically asks for the index of the first occurrence and does not mandate that the implementation be optimized. The function meets all outlined requirements correctly, including correctly handling edge cases. Therefore, the initial assessment marking it as incorrect does not hold when examining the annotations and understanding the constraints provided.
