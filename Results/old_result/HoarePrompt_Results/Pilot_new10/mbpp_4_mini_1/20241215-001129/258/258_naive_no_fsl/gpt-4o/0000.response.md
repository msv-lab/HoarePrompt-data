Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number of a given number of digits is an integer such that the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits is equal to the number itself. 

In the provided assertions:
- For `153`, the calculation is \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\), which correctly returns `True`.
- For `259`, the calculation is \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 8 + 125 + 729 = 862\), and it correctly returns `False`.
- For `4458`, the calculation is \(4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 = 256 + 256 + 625 + 4096 = 4223\), which also correctly returns `False`.

The program can handle any integer input and accurately checks the Armstrong condition based on the number of digits dynamically. Thus, it fulfills all potential cases for checking Armstrong numbers.
