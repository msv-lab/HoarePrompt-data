You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a number is an Armstrong number. Here's why it's correct:

1. It converts the number to a string to facilitate easy digit extraction.
2. It calculates the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits in the original number.
3. Finally, it checks whether this calculated sum equals the original number.

All test cases provided (`153`, `259`, and `4458`) and edge cases (like single-digit numbers and other multi-digit numbers) are handled correctly as this implementation accurately follows the definition of an Armstrong number. For example:
- For `153`, \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\), which is true.
- For `259`, \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 8 + 125 + 729 = 862\), which is false.
- For `4458`, \(4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 \neq 4458\), which is also false.

Since there are no identified edge cases where the provided program fails to determine correctly whether a number is an Armstrong number, the conclusion is that the program is correct in all potential scenarios.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is an Armstrong number. It calculates the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`, and returns `True` if this sum equals `n`, and `False` otherwise. The function correctly handles any non-negative integer, including single-digit numbers which are always Armstrong numbers. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
