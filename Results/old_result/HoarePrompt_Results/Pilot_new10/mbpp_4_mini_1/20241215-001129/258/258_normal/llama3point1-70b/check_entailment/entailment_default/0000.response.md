Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided code correctly implements the logic to check whether a given number `num` is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number (also known as a narcissistic number) is defined such that the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the total number of digits equals the number itself. 

The function `func_1`:

1. Converts the number to a string to easily access each digit and determine the number of digits.
2. Computes the total number of digits `num_len`.
3. Iterates through each digit, raising it to the power of `num_len`, summing these results.
4. Finally, it checks if the computed sum equals the original number `num`.

The output hints correctly describe the functionality of the code as well, confirming that it checks for the Armstrong condition and returns the appropriate boolean value. 

Since the code works for known Armstrong numbers (like 0, 1, 153, 370, 371, 407) and non-Armstrong numbers (like 2, 3, 4, 10, etc.), it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. Thus, the function is correct.
