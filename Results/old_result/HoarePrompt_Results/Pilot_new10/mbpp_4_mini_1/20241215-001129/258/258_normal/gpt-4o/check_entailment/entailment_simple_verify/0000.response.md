Final: **True** 

Reason: The original assessment is accurate because the provided program correctly implements the logic to check if a number is an Armstrong number. The annotations confirm that the function computes the sum of each digit raised to the power of the number of digits and checks if that sum equals the original number, which aligns perfectly with the definition of an Armstrong number. The test cases provided are all handled correctly, confirming that the program behaves as expected in all assessed scenarios.
