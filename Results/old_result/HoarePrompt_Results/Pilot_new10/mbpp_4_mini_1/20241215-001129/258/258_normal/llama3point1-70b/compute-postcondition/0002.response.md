The value of `sum` is initialized to 0. Since this does not affect any other variables, the other states remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, and `sum` is 0.

Output State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num_str` is a string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is 0**.
