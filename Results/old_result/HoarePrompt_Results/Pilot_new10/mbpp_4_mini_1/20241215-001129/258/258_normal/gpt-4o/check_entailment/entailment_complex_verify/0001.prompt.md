You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum((int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str))
    return armstrong_sum == n


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic to determine whether a number is an Armstrong number. An Armstrong number of a given number of digits is an integer such that the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the number of digits is equal to the number itself. 

In the provided assertions:
- For `153`, the calculation is \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 1 + 125 + 27 = 153\), which correctly returns `True`.
- For `259`, the calculation is \(2^3 + 5^3 + 9^3 = 8 + 125 + 729 = 862\), and it correctly returns `False`.
- For `4458`, the calculation is \(4^4 + 4^4 + 5^4 + 8^4 = 256 + 256 + 625 + 4096 = 4223\), which also correctly returns `False`.

The program can handle any integer input and accurately checks the Armstrong condition based on the number of digits dynamically. Thus, it fulfills all potential cases for checking Armstrong numbers.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1(153) == True
assert func_1(259) == False
assert func_1(4458) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n):
    num_str = str(n)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    armstrong_sum = sum(int(digit) ** num_len for digit in num_str)
    return armstrong_sum == n
    #The program returns whether the sum of each digit in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len` is equal to the original non-negative integer `n`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and checks if it is an Armstrong number. It calculates the sum of each digit of `n` raised to the power of the number of digits in `n`, and returns `True` if this sum equals `n`, and `False` otherwise. The function correctly handles any non-negative integer, including single-digit numbers which are always Armstrong numbers.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
