Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly implements the logic required to determine whether a given non-negative integer is an Armstrong number. The annotated version of the code confirms that all relevant state variables (`num`, `num_str`, `num_len`, and `sum`) are correct before evaluation and that the final return condition correctly checks if the calculated `sum` matches the original `num`. Given the problem description and the annotations, the function fulfills the requirements for checking Armstrong numbers, validating the original assessment of correctness.
