The variable `num_len` is assigned the value of the length of `num_str`. Since `num_str` is a string representation of `n` (a non-negative integer), the length of `num_str` corresponds to the number of digits in `n`. Therefore, `num_len` will be a non-negative integer equal to the number of digits in `n`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `n`; `num_len` is the number of digits in `n`.**
