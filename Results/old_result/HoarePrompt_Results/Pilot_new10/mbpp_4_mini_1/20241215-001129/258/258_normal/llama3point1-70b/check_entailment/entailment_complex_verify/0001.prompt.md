You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to check whether the given number is armstrong or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
    return sum == num


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements a function to check whether a given number is an Armstrong number (also known as a Narcissistic number). Here's why the program is correct:

1. **Armstrong Number Definition**: An Armstrong number for a given number of digits is a number that is equal to the sum of its own digits each raised to the power of the number of digits. For example, 153 is an Armstrong number because \(1^3 + 5^3 + 3^3 = 153\).

2. **Input Handling**: The function converts the input number into a string to iterate over each digit. This allows it to correctly handle any integer input.

3. **Calculation Logic**:
   - It calculates the number of digits (`num_len`).
   - It correctly initializes a sum variable to accumulate the total.
   - It iterates through each digit of the number, raising each digit to the power of `num_len` and adding it to the sum.
   - Finally, it checks if the calculated sum is equal to the original number (`num`).

4. **Edge Cases**: 
   - The function properly handles single-digit numbers (0-9), which are all Armstrong numbers since \(x^1 = x\).
   - It also handles multi-digit Armstrong numbers and non-Armstrong numbers accurately.

Since I could not identify any input case for which the function fails to provide the correct output, the program works as required according to the given problem description.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(num):
    num_str = str(num)
    num_len = len(num_str)
    sum = 0
    for digit in num_str:
        sum += int(digit) ** num_len
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `num` is a non-negative integer (â‰¥ 0), `num_str` is the string representation of `num`, `num_len` is the number of digits in `num`, `sum` is equal to the sum of each integer value of the digits in `num_str` raised to the power of `num_len`.
    return sum == num
    #The program returns whether 'sum' is equal to 'num', where 'sum' is the sum of each digit of 'num' raised to the power of 'num_len', and 'num_len' is the number of digits in 'num'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns `True` if `num` is an Armstrong number; that is, if the sum of its digits each raised to the power of the total number of digits equals `num`. If this condition is not satisfied, it returns `False`.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
