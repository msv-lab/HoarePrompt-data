According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `num_str`, which is the string representation of `num`. The loop iterates over each character in `num_str`. If `num_str` has more digits, the loop will execute again for the next digit. 

At the end of the last iteration, `num_str` has been processed up to its last character, and the current `digit` corresponds to the last character of `num_str`. Therefore, if `num_len` is at least 1, it indicates that there were digits to process in `num_str`. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that `num_str` has more digits, which would require `num_len` to be increased. As the loop processes each digit sequentially, the next value for `digit` would correspond to the next character in `num_str`, which does not exist after the last iteration.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, we must have an updated `num_str` that has at least one more digit, and the value of `digit` should refer to that potential next digit. 

State: **`num` is a non-negative integer (â‰¥ 0), `num_str` is the string representation of `num` updated to have at least one more digit, `num_len` is at least 2, and `sum` is updated by adding `int(digit)` for the new digit.**
