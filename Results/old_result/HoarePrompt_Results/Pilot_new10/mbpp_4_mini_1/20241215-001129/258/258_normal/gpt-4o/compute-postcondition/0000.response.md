`num_str` is assigned the string representation of `n`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer, so `num_str` will be a string that represents that non-negative integer. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `num_str` is a string representation of `n`.**
