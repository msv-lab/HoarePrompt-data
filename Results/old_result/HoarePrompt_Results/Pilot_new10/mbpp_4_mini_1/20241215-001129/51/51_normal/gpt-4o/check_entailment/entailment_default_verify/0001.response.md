Final: **False**

The original assessment correctly identifies a critical flaw in the implementation of `func_1`: it does not handle the case of an empty list, which would lead to a division by zero error. However, the output hints indicate that the function is meant to work only with *non-empty* lists of numbers, which implies that the function is expected to be called with appropriate input. This means the assumption regarding input validity is crucial for the final assessment.

Since the output hints suggest that the function is expected to handle non-empty lists and that input will always be valid, the program technically meets the requirements based on the given expectations in the output hints. Given that the assessment assessed the program's performance against edge cases which are not expected to occur (such as an empty list), we find that the original assessment may be overly stringent.

Thus, while the function does not handle an empty list, the provided guidelines imply that such an input case will not be encountered, and the function works correctly within the constraints. Since it meets the specifications for valid inputs, the final assessment of correctness changes to account for the assumptions stated in the output hints.

Conclusively, recognizing that the function operates correctly under expected scenarios:

Final: **True**
