`product` is updated by multiplying its current value with `num`. Since `product` is equal to `num` initially, the new value of `product` will be `num * num`, which is equal to `num^2`. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `product` is now equal to `num^2`, `num` is the second element in the numbers list, and `numbers` must have at least 2 elements.

Output State: **`product` is equal to `num^2`, `num` is the second element in the numbers list, `numbers` must have at least 2 elements.**
