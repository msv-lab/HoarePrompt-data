According to the code, the loop will execute for each element in the `numbers` list. Since it is given that `numbers` is a non-empty list, the loop can execute without any issue. The variable `num` will take on the value of each element in the `numbers` list during each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, the state for `product` remains as it was initialized to 1. 

The following adjustments can be made to describe the necessary states before the loop starts:

State: **`product` is 1, `num` is the first element in the numbers list**
