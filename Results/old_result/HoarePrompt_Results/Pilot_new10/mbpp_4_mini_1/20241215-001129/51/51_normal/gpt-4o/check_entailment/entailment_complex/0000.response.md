Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly fulfills the requirements outlined in the problem description. 

Hereâ€™s an explanation of how the function meets the specified criteria:

1. **Input Specification**: The function accepts a non-empty list of numbers (integers or floats) as its argument, which aligns with the requirement that the input should be a list of numbers.

2. **Calculating the Product**: Within the function, a loop iterates through each number in the list. The product of these numbers is computed by initializing a variable `product` to 1 and multiplying it by each number in the list sequentially. This process ensures that the product of all numbers is accurately calculated.

3. **Division by Length of the List**: After computing the product, the function then divides this product by the length of the input list. The length of the list is calculated using `len(numbers)`, which returns the total count of numbers in the list.

4. **Returning the Result**: Finally, the function returns the resulting value, which is the product divided by the length of the list. This matches perfectly with the problem description's requirement of multiplying all numbers and then dividing by the count of those numbers.

5. **Assertions**: The function has been tested with several assertions to confirm its accuracy. Each test checks if the output of `func_1` closely matches the expected result, demonstrating that the function behaves correctly with various inputs.

Since the implementation is strictly in accordance with the problem description, handling non-empty lists of numbers as specified and performing the correct mathematical operations, the conclusion is that the function is indeed correct.
