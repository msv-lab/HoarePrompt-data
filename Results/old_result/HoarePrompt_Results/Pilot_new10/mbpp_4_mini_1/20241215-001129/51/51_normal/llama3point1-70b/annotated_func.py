#State of the program right berfore the function call: numbers is a list of integers or floats, and the list is not empty.
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `product` is the product of all elements in `numbers`, `numbers` is a list of integers or floats.
    return product / len(numbers)
    #The program returns the average of all elements in 'numbers', calculated as product divided by the length of the list 'numbers'.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a non-empty list of integers or floats, computes the product of all the elements in the list, and returns the average as the product divided by the length of the list. However, this implementation incorrectly calculates the average by using the product instead of the sum; additionally, if the list contains only one element, the average returned is that element itself, but the logic does not handle lists appropriately when their product is zero. Thus, the function does not implement the standard average calculation correctly.
