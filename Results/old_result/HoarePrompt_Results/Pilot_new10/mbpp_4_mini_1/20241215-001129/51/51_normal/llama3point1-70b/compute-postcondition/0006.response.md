The value of `product` is updated by multiplying it with `num`. Given that `product` is initially equal to `num^2`, after executing the line of code, `product` will be equal to `num^2 * num`, which simplifies to `num^3`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`product` is equal to `num^3`, `num` is the third element in the numbers list, `numbers` must have at least 3 elements.**
