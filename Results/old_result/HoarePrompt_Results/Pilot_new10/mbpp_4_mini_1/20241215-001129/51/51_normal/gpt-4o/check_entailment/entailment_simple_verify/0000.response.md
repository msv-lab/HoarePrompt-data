Final: **True**

The original assessment stated that the program is incorrect due to not handling the case of an empty list, which could result in a division by zero error. However, the annotated version clarifies that the function `func_1` is being called with a non-empty list of numbers. It is also assumed that the input will always be valid and non-empty as per the problem description. Therefore, under the given assumptions, the program correctly computes the product of the numbers and divides it by the length of the list, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description. Thus, the original assessment of false correctness does not hold, making the program valid for the specified scenarios.
