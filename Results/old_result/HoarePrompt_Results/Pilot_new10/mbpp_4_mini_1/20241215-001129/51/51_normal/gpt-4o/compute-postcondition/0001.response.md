According to the code, the loop will execute once for each item in the `numbers` list. Since it is stated that `numbers` is a non-empty list, the loop can start executing without any issues. At the beginning of the loop, the first iteration gives the variable `num` the value of the first element in the `numbers` list.

Thus, for the loop to be executed correctly, we need to ensure the correct initialization of the loop variable and we also need to observe the state of `product` which remains at its initial value of 1. Therefore, the relevant states are as follows:

State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list of numbers, `product` is 1, `num` is the first number in the list**
