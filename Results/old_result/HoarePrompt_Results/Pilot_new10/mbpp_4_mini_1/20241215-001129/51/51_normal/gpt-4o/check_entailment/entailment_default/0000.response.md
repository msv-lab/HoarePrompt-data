Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` calculates the product of all the numbers in the input list and then divides this product by the length of the list. While the implementation seems correct for typical cases, it does not handle the case where the list contains zero. If any number in the list is zero, the product will be zero, and thus the result will also be zero, even if the length of the list is greater than 1. This behavior may lead to unexpected results in cases where the problem description does not explicitly stipulate such scenarios. For example, when the list is (0, 5, 10), the expected output would be 0 divided by 3, which is still 0, and it might not necessarily reflect the intended mathematical interpretation of "multiplying all numbers" before dividing. 

The output hints do not specify how the presence of zero values impacts the product and final result, leading to this ambiguity. As a result, the program does not handle every potential case correctly according to the problem description.
