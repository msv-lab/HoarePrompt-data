The `product` variable is assigned the value of `product` multiplied by `num`. The initial value of `product` is 1, and `num` is the first number in the list `numbers`. Therefore, `product` becomes equal to the value of `num` after the multiplication.

The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the updated value of `product` and the existing states of the other variables.

Output State: **`numbers` is a non-empty list of numbers, `product` is the value of `num`, `num` is the first number in the list**.
