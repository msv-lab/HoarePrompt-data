To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, let's analyze the problem description and the code implementation.

**Problem Description:** 
The task is to write a function that multiplies all the numbers in a list and then divides the result by the length of the list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(numbers):
    product = 1
    for num in numbers:
        product *= num
    return product / len(numbers)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Empty List Case:** 
   - If the input list `numbers` is empty (`[]`), the `len(numbers)` will return `0`. This will lead to a division by zero error when trying to execute `product / len(numbers)`, as dividing by zero is undefined in mathematics and will cause a runtime exception in Python.

2. **Normal Cases:** 
   - For a non-empty list, the program correctly multiplies all numbers together and divides that product by the length of the list.

3. **Negative Numbers and Zero:**
   - If the list includes zeros, the product will be `0`, and the result will be `0` (which is correct).
   - The program will also work with negative numbers, returning a negative value but mathematically accurate according to the description.

### Conclusion:
While the program works well for a variety of cases, the empty list case is a critical flaw where it does not handle the case as per the problem's requirements. Specifically, it does not define what to do with an empty list, leading to a division by zero error.

Given this analysis, we can conclude:
Correctness: **False** 

The program fails when provided with an empty list, which is a fundamental case that needs to be handled.
