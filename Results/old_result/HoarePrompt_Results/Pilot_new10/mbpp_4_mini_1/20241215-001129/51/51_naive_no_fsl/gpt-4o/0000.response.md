To determine the correctness of the given program against the problem description, we need to analyze the function `func_1` and see if it meets the requirements of multiplying all the numbers in a list and then dividing by the length of that list.

The function `func_1` performs the following steps:
1. It initializes a variable `product` to 1.
2. It iterates through each number in the input list `numbers` and multiplies each number to the `product`.
3. Finally, it divides the `product` by the length of the list and returns the result.

Now, let's consider the potential edge cases that might affect the correctness of this implementation:

### Edge Cases
1. **Empty List**: If the input list is empty, calling `len(numbers)` would return 0, leading to a division by zero error when calculating `result = product / len(numbers)`. This is a critical case that is not handled in the code.
2. **Single Element List**: For a list with a single element, the function should return that element itself, and since dividing by 1 is valid, this edge case appears to work correctly.
3. **Negative Numbers**: As demonstrated in the assertions, the function handles negative numbers correctly by multiplying them appropriately.
4. **Zero in the List**: If the list contains zero, the product would be zero, and dividing zero by the length of the list would result in zero, which is expected behavior.

Based on this analysis, while the function handles several cases correctly, it fails to handle an empty list gracefully.

Since there is at least one case (the empty list) that is not handled properly by the program leading to a runtime error, we conclude that the program is not correct.

Correctness: **False**
