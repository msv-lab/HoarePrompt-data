Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to handle the case when the input list is empty. If an empty list is passed to the function `func_1`, it will result in a division by zero when dividing the product by `len(numbers)`, since the length of the list would be zero. Thus, it does not meet the problem description's requirement for all potential cases.
