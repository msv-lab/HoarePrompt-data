Explanation: The code seems to be functioning correctly according to the problem description and the examples provided. The function checks if all items in the list `lst` are equal to the given `element`. It returns `True` if they are all equal; otherwise, it returns `False`. The behavior in case of an empty list is also correctly handled because the code will return `True`, indicating that all (zero) items match the element.

The output hints also agree with this behavior, stating that if the list is empty, the function will return `True`, as there are no items to contradict the condition.

Since the function has been tested against various cases, including instances where the items are not equal to the element and where they are, along with the case of an empty list, it adheres completely to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
