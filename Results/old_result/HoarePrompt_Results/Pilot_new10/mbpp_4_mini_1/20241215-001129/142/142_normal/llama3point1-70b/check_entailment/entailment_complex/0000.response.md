Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` that accepts a list `lst` and an `element`, and it checks whether all items in the list are equal to the given element.

Hereâ€™s how it fulfills the requirements:

1. **Checking Equality**: The expression `all(item == element for item in lst)` iterates through every item in the list `lst` and checks if it is equal to `element`. This approach directly verifies whether each item meets the stated condition (i.e., being equal to `element`).

2. **Handling Edge Cases**: The comments mention that the function handles edge cases, such as an empty list, where `all()` returns `True` because there are no items in the list to contradict the condition. This behavior aligns perfectly with the requirement: if the list is empty, it's vacuously true that all items (none in this case) are equal to `element`.

Overall, the program adheres to the problem description by accurately implementing the logic needed to determine if all elements in the list match the specified value, thus making it correct.
