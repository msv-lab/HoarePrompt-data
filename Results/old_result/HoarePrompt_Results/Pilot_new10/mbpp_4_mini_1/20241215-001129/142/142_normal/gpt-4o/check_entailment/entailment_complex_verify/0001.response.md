Final: **True**

The original assessment argued that the function did not handle the case of an empty list correctly. However, upon reviewing the program and the annotated version, it is clear that the program will indeed return `True` for an empty list, which aligns with the common interpretation of the requirement. The annotations confirm that if there are no items (an empty list), the return value would be `True` as there are no items to contradict the condition. 

Thus, the original assessment is not accurate because it overlooked that the function correctly handles the case of an empty list, which is an important part of the functionality specified in the problem description. Since the program works as intended by the problem's requirements, the final correctness of the program is confirmed.
