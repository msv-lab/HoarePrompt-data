Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate because the program correctly implements the requirement stated in the problem description. The function `func_1` uses the `all()` function with a generator expression to check if every item in the provided list `lst` equals the specified `element`. 

The output hints confirm that the function correctly handles edge cases, such as returning `True` for an empty list, which aligns with the expected behavior of the program. The function meets the conditions outlined in the problem description and behaves as intended for all potential cases, which validates the correctness of the original assessment.
