Final: **True**

The original assessment accurately assesses the program's correctness based on the problem description. The annotated version reaffirms that the function `func_1` is designed to return `True` when all items in the list `lst` are equal to the provided `element`, and `False` otherwise. The explanation regarding the handling of different cases (empty list, all items equal, at least one item not equal) aligns with the behavior of the `all()` function and the generator expression used in the function. Since the input is assumed to be valid and the function behaves as expected for all defined scenarios, the conclusion that the implementation fulfills the requirement is valid. Therefore, the final assessment remains that the program is correct.
