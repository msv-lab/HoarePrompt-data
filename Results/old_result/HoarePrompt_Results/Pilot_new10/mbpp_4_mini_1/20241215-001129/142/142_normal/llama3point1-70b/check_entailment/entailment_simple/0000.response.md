Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. It defines a function `func_1` which takes in a list `lst` and an `element`. The line `all(item == element for item in lst)` checks whether every item in the list `lst` is equal to the given `element`. 

Hereâ€™s how it works:
- The `all()` function returns `True` if all items in the iterable provided to it are `True`. In this case, the iterable is a generator expression that evaluates to `True` if `item == element` for each item in `lst`.
- If `lst` is empty, `all()` returns `True`, which aligns with the interpretation that "all items in the list are equal to the given element" can be vacuously true when there are no items to compare.

This logic guarantees that the function meets the stated requirement of checking if all items in the list are equal to the specified element. Therefore, the program behaves as expected according to the problem description.
