Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the input list is empty. According to the problem description, the function should check whether all items in the list are equal to the given element. If the list is empty, the function should ideally return `True`, since there are no items that contradict the condition of being equal to the given element. However, the provided function will return `True` if the list is not empty and all elements are equal to the given element but does not handle the empty list case correctly, as there is no check for this situation. 

For example, if we call `func_1([], 'anything')`, it will return `True`, which is correct according to common interpretations of "all items are equal". However, since the implementation does not explicitly handle this case or return a specific response for it, it may lead to confusion in understanding whether the implementation is following the problem description.

Thus, the program fails to satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.
