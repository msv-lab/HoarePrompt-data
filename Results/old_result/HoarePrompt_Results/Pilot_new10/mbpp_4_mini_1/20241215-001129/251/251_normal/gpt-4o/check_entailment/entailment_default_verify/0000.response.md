Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The program correctly implements the conversion of rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates using the appropriate formulas: \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) for the radial distance and \( \theta = \text{atan2}(y, x) \) for the angle. The function handles all quadrants, including edge cases like when \( x \) is 0, as specified in the output hints. The assertions used to validate the function further support its correctness by providing specific inputs and their expected outputs. The overall implementation adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description, and there are no identified issues with the function's handling of valid input.
