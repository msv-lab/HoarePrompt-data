Functionality: ** The function accepts two real numbers, `x` and `y`, representing the rectangular coordinates, and returns a tuple containing `r`, the hypotenuse calculated using these coordinates, and `phi`, the angle in radians calculated using the coordinates `(y, x)`. It correctly computes the hypotenuse using the Cartesian coordinates, while the angle is derived from swapping the order of the input parameters, potentially leading to confusion regarding the expected coordinate relationships. **
