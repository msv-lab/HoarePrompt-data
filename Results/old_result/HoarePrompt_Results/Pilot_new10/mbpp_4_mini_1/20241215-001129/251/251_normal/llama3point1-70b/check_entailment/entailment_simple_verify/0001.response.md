Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The provided function `func_1` correctly converts rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ). 

The annotations clarify that before the function call, `x` and `y` are real numbers, which aligns with the problem description. The calculations within the function use appropriate mathematical methods: `math.hypot(x, y)` correctly computes the radius \( r \), and `math.atan2(y, x)` accurately computes the angle \( φ \), considering the signs of both inputs to determine the quadrant.

Furthermore, the annotated code emphasizes that both calculations return valid results for any real numbers, and the program will handle all cases without leading to errors, given the assumption of valid input. Thus, the program adheres strictly to the requirements of converting rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
