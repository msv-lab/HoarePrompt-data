Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description, which requires converting rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, θ). 

Here’s why it meets the requirements:

1. **Conversion Logic**: 
   - The program uses the formula for calculating the radial coordinate \( r \) as \( r = \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \). This formula correctly computes the distance from the origin to the point (x, y) in Cartesian coordinates.
   - The angle \( \theta \) is calculated using `math.atan2(y, x)`, which returns the angle in radians from the positive x-axis to the point (x, y). This function handles the signs of x and y correctly and gives the angle in the correct quadrant.

2. **Return Values**: 
   - The function returns a tuple `(r, theta)`, which is the expected output format according to the problem description.

3. **Test Cases**: 
   - The assertions provided in the program test the function with various values for x and y. Each assertion checks that the function returns the expected polar coordinates, demonstrating that the function works correctly for the specific test cases.

No input cases were provided that would lead to incorrect results, and the function appears to handle all scenarios covered by the tested inputs accurately. Thus, it adheres to the problem requirements fully.
