The provided code successfully implements a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates, utilizing the formulas for the radial coordinate \( r \) and the angle \( \theta \).

1. The calculation of \( r \) using \( \sqrt{x^2 + y^2} \) is accurate and complies with the mathematical definition of the distance from the origin to the point \((x, y)\).
2. The calculation of \( \theta \) using \( \math.atan2(y, x) \) is particularly noteworthy because it handles all quadrants correctly and addresses potential issues such as division by zero when \( x \) is zero. 

The output hints confirm that the function correctly computes both \( r \) and \( \theta \) according to the expected definitions and successfully handles edge cases. Additionally, examples provided in the assertions match the expected results of the function.

Since the function meets the problem description and behaves correctly for all potential cases, we conclude that the correctness assertion is valid.

Correctness: **True**.
