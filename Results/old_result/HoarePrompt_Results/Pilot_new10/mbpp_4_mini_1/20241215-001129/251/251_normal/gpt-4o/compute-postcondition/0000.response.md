The variable `r` is assigned the value `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`, which calculates the distance from the origin (0, 0) to the point (x, y) in a Cartesian coordinate system using the Pythagorean theorem. The values of `x` and `y` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are floating-point numbers representing the rectangular coordinates, and `r` is equal to `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are floating-point numbers representing the rectangular coordinates, `r` is equal to `math.sqrt(x ** 2 + y ** 2)`**.
