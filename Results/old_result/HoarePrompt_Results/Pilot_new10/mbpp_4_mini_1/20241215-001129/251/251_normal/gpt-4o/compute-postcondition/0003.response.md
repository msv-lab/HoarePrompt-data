The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are floating-point numbers representing the rectangular coordinates. After executing the function body, the program returns two values: `r`, which is the radial coordinate calculated as the distance from the origin to the point (x, y), and `theta`, which is the angle in radians calculated from `math.atan2(y, x)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two floating-point numbers representing rectangular coordinates and returns the radial distance and the angle in radians based on those coordinates.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters x and y as floating-point numbers representing rectangular coordinates and returns the radial coordinate r and the angle theta in radians.**
