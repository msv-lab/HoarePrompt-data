You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to convert rectangular coordinates to polar coordinates.
Program:
```
import math

def func_1(x, y):
    r = math.hypot(x, y)
    phi = math.atan2(y, x)
    return (r, phi)


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the conversion from rectangular coordinates (x, y) to polar coordinates (r, φ). 

- `math.hypot(x, y)` computes the radius \( r \) as the Euclidean distance from the origin to the point (x, y), which is indeed the a correct formula for finding the radius in polar coordinates.
- `math.atan2(y, x)` computes the angle \( φ \) in radians, accounting for the signs of both \( x \) and \( y \) to determine the correct quadrant for the angle.

The implementation handles all cases, including those on the axes (e.g. when \( x \) is 0, \( y \) is 0, etc.), because `atan2` returns a proper angle in all scenarios.

Since the program outputs accurate and expected polar coordinates for any pair of rectangular coordinates, I find no edge cases or inputs that would cause it to fail the problem description. Thus, the code adheres strictly to the requirements, making it correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts two real numbers, `x` and `y`, representing the rectangular coordinates, and returns a tuple containing `r`, the hypotenuse calculated using these coordinates, and `phi`, the angle in radians calculated using the coordinates `(y, x)`. It correctly computes the hypotenuse using the Cartesian coordinates, while the angle is derived from swapping the order of the input parameters, potentially leading to confusion regarding the expected coordinate relationships. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
