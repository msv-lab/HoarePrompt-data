Final: **True** 

Reasoning: The original assessment accurately evaluates the correctness of the function `func_1`, stating that it correctly implements the conversion from rectangular to polar coordinates using the appropriate formulas. The edge cases described are indeed handled as expected, returning the correct values for all inputs considered, as confirmed in both the assessments of the assertions and the additional edge cases. The output hints further support this by highlighting that the function properly calculates both the radial coordinate `r` and the angle `theta`, and correctly accounts for different quadrants and special cases without errors. Overall, all checks affirm that the implementation meets the problem specifications fully, validating the correctness of the program.
