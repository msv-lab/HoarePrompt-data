To derive the output state after all iterations of the provided loop have finished executing, we need to analyze the behavior of the loop and the relationships between the variables involved.

Given the code for the loop:
```python
for i in range(1, len(nums)):
    for j in range(i):
        if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
            dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
```

The initial state indicates that `nums` is a sorted list of integers, and `dp` is initialized with the value `1` for each element, indicating that the minimum length of a divisible subsequence ending at each number is `1` (the number itself).

**Analysis of the Loop:**
- The outer loop iterates over each index `i` starting from `1` to `len(nums) - 1`.
- The inner loop iterates over all prior indices `j` (from `0` to `i-1`).
- For each pair of indices `(i, j)`, if `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, we update `dp[i]` to be the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`, effectively counting the length of the longest divisible subsequence that can end with `nums[i]`.

After all iterations:
- `dp[i]` for each index `i` will represent the length of the longest divisible subsequence that ends with `nums[i]`, given the previous elements in `nums`.
- The value of `dp` will depend on the divisibility relationships between the integers in `nums`.

### Output State
After all iterations of the loop have executed:
Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`, and each `dp[i]` represents the maximum length of the divisible subsequence ending with `nums[i]` based on the earlier elements in `nums`.**
