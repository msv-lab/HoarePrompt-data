According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `i`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is greater than 0, and `j` is currently less than `i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. Thus, if `j` is currently `k`, then after one more iteration `j` will be `k + 1`, and for the loop to continue executing again, `i` must be greater than `k + 1`.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element, `dp` is a list of ones with length equal to `nums`, `i` must be greater than `j + 1`**
