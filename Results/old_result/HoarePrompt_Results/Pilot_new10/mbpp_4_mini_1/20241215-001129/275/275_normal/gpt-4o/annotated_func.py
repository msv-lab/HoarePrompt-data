#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as 'nums' is an empty list of integers
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers that is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsequences derived from `nums`, where each `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum length of divisible subsets ending at index `i`. If the loop does not execute, then `dp` remains a list of ones with each `dp[i]` equal to 1 for all indices, meaning there is no divisible relationship established among the elements in `nums`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subsequences derived from the sorted list of integers in 'nums', as reflected in the 'dp' list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns 0 if `nums` is empty. Otherwise, it computes and returns the maximum length of the longest subset of indices in `nums` such that each element at a higher index is divisible by the element at a lower index, after sorting `nums`.
