Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 1 element; `dp` is updated such that each `dp[i]` represents the length of the longest divisible subset ending at index `i` in `nums`. If `nums[i]` is divisible by any `nums[j]` for `j < i`, then `dp[i]` is set to `max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` accordingly. If the loop does not execute, then `dp` remains a list of ones where `dp[i]` stays 1 for each index `i`.**
