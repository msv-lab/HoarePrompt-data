According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `i`. For the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 1 since the range function generates values starting from 0 up to, but not including, the value of `i`. Given that `i` is defined as `k + 1`, `k` must be at least 0 for `i` to be at least 1. 

Moreover, we know that `len(nums)` must be greater than `k + 1`, ensuring that when `i` is calculated as `k + 1`, it does not exceed the number of elements in `nums`.

Thus, the state should be adjusted as follows to reflect the necessary conditions for the loop to execute:

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`; `k` is at least 0; `i` is equal to `k + 1`, which is at least 1; `len(nums)` must be greater than `k + 1`**
