Postcondition: ***`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` contains the lengths of divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`, `i` is greater than 0, `j` is 0. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, then `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum of `old_dp_i` and `dp[j] + 1`.***
