According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i`. The loop is set to run `i` times, but for the loop to execute, `i` must be at least 1, since `range(i)` produces no values if `i` is 0. Additionally, `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, so its state does not need to be changed for the loop's execution but the position of `j` will need to be adjusted.

For the loop to be executed properly, `i` must be greater than 0, and at the start of the loop, `j` will begin at 0. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` contains the lengths of divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`, `i` must be greater than 0, `j` is 0**
