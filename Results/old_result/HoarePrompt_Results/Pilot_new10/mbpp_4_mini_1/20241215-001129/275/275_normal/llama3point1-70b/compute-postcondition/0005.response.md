According to the code, the loop is designed to iterate over the range from 1 to `len(nums) - 1`. Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers and is not empty, we know that `len(nums)` is at least 1. However, the loop will only execute if `len(nums)` is greater than 1 because the starting point of the range is 1 and the end point is `len(nums)`. If `len(nums)` is 1, then the loop will not execute as the range will be empty.

To ensure the loop can execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. Ensure that `len(nums)` is greater than 1, allowing for at least one iteration.
2. At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 1.

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `nums` must have at least 2 elements, `dp` is a list of length equal to `len(nums)` filled with the value `1`, `i` is 1**
