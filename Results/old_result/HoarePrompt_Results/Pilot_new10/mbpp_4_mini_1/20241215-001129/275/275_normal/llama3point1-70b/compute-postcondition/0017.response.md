According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the length of `nums`, which means that the loop has completed its last iteration without executing the body of the loop for this value of `i`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that `i` will be incremented at the start of the next iteration. However, since `i` is currently equal to `len(nums)`, the next value of `i` will be one more than the length of `nums`, which means that it will no longer satisfy the loop condition of being less than `len(nums)`.

Thus, to allow for a legitimate next loop iteration, we need to make a hypothetical adjustment where `i` would need to be less than `len(nums)` for it to execute again. Therefore, we denote that `i` must be adjusted downwards to fit the loop condition.

However, since the requirement is to define the state as it stands for the next theoretical iteration, `i` must be defined as it currently is but also be noted that it can't lead to further execution.

The state before the loop is attempting to run, therefore must consider these conditions:

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` contains the lengths of divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`, and `i` must be less than `len(nums)`**.
