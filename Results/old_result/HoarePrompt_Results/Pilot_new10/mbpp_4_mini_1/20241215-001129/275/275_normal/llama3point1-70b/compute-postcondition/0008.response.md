`dp[i]` is assigned the maximum of its current value and `dp[j] + 1`. Since `dp` was initially filled with `1`, `dp[i]` will be updated based on the value of `dp[j] + 1`. Given that `dp[j]` is `1`, the value of `dp[j] + 1` is `2`. Depending on the prior value of `dp[i]`, which is also `1`, `dp[i]` will now become `2`, if `2` is greater than the current `dp[i]`. 

Therefore, the possible output state updates `dp[i]` and retains the rest of the variable values. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` is updated at index `i` to be either 1 or 2; `i` is 1; `j` is 0; and the current value of `nums[i]` is divisible by the current value of `nums[j]`.**
