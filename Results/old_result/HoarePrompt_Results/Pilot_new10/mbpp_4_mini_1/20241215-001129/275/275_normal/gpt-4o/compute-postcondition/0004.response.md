The variable `dp` is assigned a new list where each element is `1`, repeated for the length of `nums`. The specific content of `dp` will depend on the length of the `nums` list, but it will always contain only the number `1`. The initial state of `nums` is a sorted list of integers, which remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` is a list of ones with length equal to the length of `nums`.**
