The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. If `nums` is empty, the function returns 0. If `nums` is not empty, the function returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subsequences that can be formed with the elements of the sorted list `nums`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return the length of the longest divisible subsequence, or return 0 if the list is empty. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers nums, returns 0 if nums is empty. If nums is not empty, it returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subsequences that can be formed with the elements of the sorted list nums.**
