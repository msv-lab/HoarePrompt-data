According to the code, the loop iterates using the variable `j` over the range defined by `i`, which is `len(nums)`. Since `nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` will be at least 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `j` must start at 0 (the first iteration) and go up to `i - 1`. 

State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements, `dp` contains the maximum length of divisible subsequences derived from `nums`, `i` is `len(nums)`, `j` is 0**
