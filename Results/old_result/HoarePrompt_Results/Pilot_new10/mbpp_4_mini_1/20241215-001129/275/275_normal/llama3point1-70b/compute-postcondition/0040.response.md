Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsequences for each element in `nums`. After all iterations, `dp[i]` will represent the maximum length of the divisible subsequence ending at `nums[i]`, considering all previous integers `nums[j]` where `j < i` and `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`.**
