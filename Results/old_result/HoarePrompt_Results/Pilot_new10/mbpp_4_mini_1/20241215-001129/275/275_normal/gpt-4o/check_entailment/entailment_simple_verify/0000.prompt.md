You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers so that every pair is divisible.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided program, we evaluate it against the problem description which states the requirement to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible.

Let's analyze the program:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Sorting**: The input list `nums` is sorted. This helps in checking divisibility as smaller numbers will come before larger numbers.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: An array `dp` is initialized to keep track of the largest subset size at each index. Each element starts with 1 (the number itself).
3. **Nested Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates through each element.
   - The inner loop checks previously processed elements. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates the `dp` array accordingly.

### Example Cases:
- For `func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18])`, the program should find that the pairs (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 18), (3, 6), (6, 18) can form subsets, and hence returns 4.
- For `func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20])`, it correctly identifies that the subset with pairs (5, 10), (15, 5), and (20, 5) returns a size of 3.
- For `func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17])`, the output of 4 is indeed correct since 1 divides everything, and we can include elements that are divisible by it (such as 3 and 6).

### Edge Case:
Now we need to check edge cases such as:
1. An empty list should return 0, which is correctly handled in the provided code.
2. Input with elements where no two are divisible, like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` should also be processed correctly and return 1 since each element is in a subset by itself.

### Testing an Edge Case:
If we test a simple case like `func_1([3, 5, 7, 11])`, none of the numbers in the list are divisible by one another, so the expected output is 1 (each number alone). 
The DP array will remain `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, and `max(dp)` will yield 1.

Thus, all the provided cases and edge cases align with the output of the function. The logic appears accurately implemented.

Given this thorough examination, including tests for diverse scenarios, we find that the program consistently yields correct results according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18]) == 4
assert func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20]) == 3
assert func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17]) == 4

#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.
def func_1(nums):
    if (not nums) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, as 'nums' is an empty list of integers
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`nums` is a list of integers that is not empty.
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a sorted list of integers, `dp` contains the lengths of the longest divisible subsequences derived from `nums`, where each `dp[i]` is updated to the maximum length of divisible subsets ending at index `i`. If the loop does not execute, then `dp` remains a list of ones with each `dp[i]` equal to 1 for all indices, meaning there is no divisible relationship established among the elements in `nums`.
    return max(dp)
    #The program returns the maximum length of the longest divisible subsequences derived from the sorted list of integers in 'nums', as reflected in the 'dp' list


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
