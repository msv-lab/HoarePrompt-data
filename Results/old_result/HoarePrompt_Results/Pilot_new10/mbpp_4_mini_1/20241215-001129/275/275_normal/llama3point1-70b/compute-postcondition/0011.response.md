The code `dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)` updates the value of `dp[i]` based on the values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]`. The previous values of `i` and `j` are given as `i = 2` and `j = 0`, with `nums` being a sorted list of integers. The specific values of `dp[i]` and `dp[j]` are not provided, but we can express the changes regarding them.

Output State: **`nums` is a sorted list of integers with at least 2 elements; `i` is 2; `j` is 0; `dp[i]` is updated to be the maximum of the previous `dp[i]` and `dp[j] + 1`.**
