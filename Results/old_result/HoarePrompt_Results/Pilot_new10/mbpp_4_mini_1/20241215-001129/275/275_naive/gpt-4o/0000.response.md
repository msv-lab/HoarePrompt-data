To determine the correctness of the provided program, we evaluate it against the problem description which states the requirement to find the size of the largest subset of a list of numbers such that every pair is divisible.

Let's analyze the program:

```python
def func_1(nums):
    if not nums:
        return 0
    nums.sort()
    dp = [1] * len(nums)
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i):
            if nums[i] % nums[j] == 0:
                dp[i] = max(dp[i], dp[j] + 1)
    return max(dp)
```

### Analysis:
1. **Sorting**: The input list `nums` is sorted. This helps in checking divisibility as smaller numbers will come before larger numbers.
2. **Dynamic Programming Array**: An array `dp` is initialized to keep track of the largest subset size at each index. Each element starts with 1 (the number itself).
3. **Nested Loop**:
   - The outer loop iterates through each element.
   - The inner loop checks previously processed elements. If `nums[i]` is divisible by `nums[j]`, it updates the `dp` array accordingly.

### Example Cases:
- For `func_1([1, 3, 6, 13, 17, 18])`, the program should find that the pairs (1, 3), (1, 6), (1, 18), (3, 6), (6, 18) can form subsets, and hence returns 4.
- For `func_1([10, 5, 3, 15, 20])`, it correctly identifies that the subset with pairs (5, 10), (15, 5), and (20, 5) returns a size of 3.
- For `func_1([18, 1, 3, 6, 13, 17])`, the output of 4 is indeed correct since 1 divides everything, and we can include elements that are divisible by it (such as 3 and 6).

### Edge Case:
Now we need to check edge cases such as:
1. An empty list should return 0, which is correctly handled in the provided code.
2. Input with elements where no two are divisible, like `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` should also be processed correctly and return 1 since each element is in a subset by itself.

### Testing an Edge Case:
If we test a simple case like `func_1([3, 5, 7, 11])`, none of the numbers in the list are divisible by one another, so the expected output is 1 (each number alone). 
The DP array will remain `[1, 1, 1, 1]`, and `max(dp)` will yield 1.

Thus, all the provided cases and edge cases align with the output of the function. The logic appears accurately implemented.

Given this thorough examination, including tests for diverse scenarios, we find that the program consistently yields correct results according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
