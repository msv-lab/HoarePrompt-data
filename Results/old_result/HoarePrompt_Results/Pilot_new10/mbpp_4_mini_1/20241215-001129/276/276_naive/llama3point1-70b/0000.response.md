Correctness: **False**.

The provided program attempts to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size, but it has a couple of issues:

1. The logic for determining the middle index is incorrect. The variable `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which would be the last index in a zero-based index list. It should instead be `size // 2` to find the correct middle index.

2. The function assumes that if `size` is even, it correctly computes the median using the two middle elements. However, the condition for finding the median should depend on the correct middle indices for even and odd sizes (which the function does not correctly implement).

3. Given that the function does not correctly handle the sizes, for the input examples where both lists have a size of 4, the function would incorrectly compute the median. For example, if `list1 = [1, 3]` and `list2 = [2, 4]`, the function as written would incorrectly handle the calculation of indices and subsequently yield incorrect median results.

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for certain inputs where the lists are sorted and of the same size.
