Correctness: **False**.

The program is supposed to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. However, the function does not handle the case where the lists are empty. For instance, if both lists were to be empty, it would lead to an error when attempting to calculate the median, since `merged_list` would also be empty.

Hereâ€™s an example case where the program does not work correctly:
```python
assert func_1([], []) ==  # Should handle empty lists but would cause an error.
```
Since the program can fail for this edge case, it is considered incorrect.
