#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, both sorted in non-decreasing order, and size is a positive integer that is equal to the length of both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `size` is a positive integer equal to the length of both lists, and `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`. If `size` is even, `median` is equal to (merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2. Otherwise, `median` is the middle element of `merged_list`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median value calculated based on the merged_list derived from the sorted lists `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, the median is the middle element of `merged_list`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, along with a positive integer `size` which represents the number of elements in each list. It merges the two lists into a single sorted list and computes the median. If `size` is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, it returns the middle element of the merged list. However, the function does not handle cases where the input lists might be empty or the assumption that `size` is equal to the length of the merged list may not hold true if the lists are not of the specified size. Additionally, there could be issues if `size` is not assigned correctly according to list lengths or if the lists contain negative integers.
