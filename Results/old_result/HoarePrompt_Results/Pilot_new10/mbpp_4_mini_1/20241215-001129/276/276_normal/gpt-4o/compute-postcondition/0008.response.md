The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are both sorted lists of integers of the same size, and a parameter `n`, which is a positive integer equal to the length of either list. After executing the function body, it calculates the median of the merged list formed from `list1` and `list2`. If the length of the merged list is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements. If the length is odd, it returns the middle element. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two sorted lists of integers and their length, and return the median of the merged list derived from these two input lists based on the length being even or odd. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists of integers (list1, list2) and their length (n), returns the median of the merged list, which is the average of the two middle elements if the merged list is even in length, or the middle element if it is odd.**
