The variable `median` is assigned the value of `merged_list[middle_index]`. Since `size` is an odd integer, `middle_index` equals `size - 1`, which allows us to locate the middle element of `merged_list`. Therefore, the value of `median` becomes the middle element of the combined sorted `list1` and `list2`. The states of `list1`, `list2`, and `merged_list` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `size` is a positive integer equal to the length of both lists, `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`, `median` is the middle element of `merged_list`.**
