Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. The critical issue arises in how the program calculates the median after merging the two lists:

1. The merge operation is performed correctly with `merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)`, which combines the two lists and sorts them.
2. The calculation of the median is based on whether the length of `merged_list` is even or odd. However, since both `list1` and `list2` are of the same size, their combined length will always be even. Therefore, the median should always be calculated as the average of the two middle elements in the merged list, specifically at indices `n-1` and `n` (where `n` is half the length of `merged_list`).

The median is calculated using:
```python
median = (merged_list[mid - 1] + merged_list[mid]) / 2
```
This is misleading because `mid` is computed as `len(merged_list) // 2`. However, in the code as written, the indices it accesses (`mid - 1` and `mid`) may not always refer to the actual middle elements when both lists have the same size `n`. 

For example, if `list1 = [1, 2]` and `list2 = [3, 4]`, the merged list will be `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The correct median would be `(2 + 3) / 2 = 2.5`, but the current implementation could mistakenly access incorrect indices.

Thus, while the idea of merging two sorted lists and calculating the median is on the right track, the actual indexing utilized in the median calculation can lead to incorrect results, which violates the problem description's requirement to find the median accurately for two sorted lists of the same size.
