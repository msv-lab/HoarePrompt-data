The code assigns the value of `size - 1` to `middle_index`, which calculates the index of the middle element in the sorted lists. The sizes of both lists remain unchanged, and `merged_list` is still the sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `size` is a positive integer equal to the length of both lists, `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`, `merged_list` is a sorted combination of `list1` and `list2`.**
