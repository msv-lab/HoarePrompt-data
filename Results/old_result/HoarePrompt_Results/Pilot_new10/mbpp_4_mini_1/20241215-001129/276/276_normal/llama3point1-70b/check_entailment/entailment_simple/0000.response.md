The provided program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description. 

### Explanation of the Issue:
1. **Incorrect Median Calculation**: The logic used in the program to determine the median is flawed. The `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which gives the index of the last element in the first half of the merged list. This is incorrect for both even and odd sizes:
   - For **even sizes**, the median should be calculated using the two middle elements of the merged list, which are located at indices `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`, not `size - 1` and `size`.
   - For **odd sizes**, the median should be the middle element located at index `size // 2`, but since the function assumes that `size` is always equal to the length of both lists (which is true for the inputs), the calculation would technically be correct for odd sizes if the indices were appropriately adjusted. However, due to the flawed `middle_index`, the method to retrieve elements is incorrect.

2. **Merging Logic**: The program merges the two sorted lists correctly but does not appropriately address the indices for accessing the correct elements when finding the median.

### Summary:
The program fails to correctly compute the median for both even and odd sizes of the sorted lists due to inappropriate handling of indices. Therefore, it does not satisfy the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False**
