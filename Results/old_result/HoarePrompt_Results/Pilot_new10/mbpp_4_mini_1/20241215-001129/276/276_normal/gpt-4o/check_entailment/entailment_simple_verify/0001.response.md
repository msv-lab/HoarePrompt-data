Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate. The function `func_1` correctly finds the median of two sorted lists of the same size by merging and sorting the lists and appropriately calculating the median based on the combined length being even or odd. The annotated version of the code affirms that the states of variables are as expected and the calculated median is consistent with the requirements set out in the problem description. All the provided test cases return the expected results, confirming the correctness of the implementation.
