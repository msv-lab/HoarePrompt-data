You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the median of two sorted lists of same size.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers, both sorted in non-decreasing order, and size is a positive integer that is equal to the length of both lists.
def func_1(list1, list2, size):
    merged_list = sorted(list1 + list2)
    middle_index = size - 1
    if (size % 2 == 0) :
        median = (merged_list[middle_index] + merged_list[middle_index + 1]) / 2
    else :
        median = merged_list[middle_index]
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `size` is a positive integer equal to the length of both lists, and `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`. If `size` is even, `median` is equal to (merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2. Otherwise, `median` is the middle element of `merged_list`.
    return median
    #The program returns the median value calculated based on the merged_list derived from the sorted lists `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, the median is the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, the median is the middle element of `merged_list`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, along with a positive integer `size` which represents the number of elements in each list. It merges the two lists into a single sorted list and computes the median. If `size` is even, it returns the average of the two middle elements; if `size` is odd, it returns the middle element of the merged list. However, the function does not handle cases where the input lists might be empty or the assumption that `size` is equal to the length of the merged list may not hold true if the lists are not of the specified size. Additionally, there could be issues if `size` is not assigned correctly according to list lengths or if the lists contain negative integers.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
