Postcondition: ***`list1` and `list2` are lists of integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `size` is a positive integer equal to the length of both lists, and `middle_index` is equal to `size - 1`. If `size` is even, `median` is equal to (merged_list[size - 1] + merged_list[size]) / 2. Otherwise, `median` is the middle element of `merged_list`.***
