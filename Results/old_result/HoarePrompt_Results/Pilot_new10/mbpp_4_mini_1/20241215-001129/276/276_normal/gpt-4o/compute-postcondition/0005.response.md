The code assigns the value of `merged_list[mid]` to `median`. Given that `mid` is equal to `n`, and considering that the length of `merged_list` is an odd number, we know that `merged_list` has elements that can be accessed with the index `n`. 

Since `merged_list` contains the elements from both `list1` and `list2`, the median will directly be equal to the element at the index specified by `mid`, which is essentially a specific reference to the properly sorted combined list.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state is:

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are two sorted lists of integers of the same size; `n` is a positive integer; `merged_list` is a sorted list combining `list1` and `list2`; `mid` is equal to `n`; `median` is equal to `merged_list[n]`.**
