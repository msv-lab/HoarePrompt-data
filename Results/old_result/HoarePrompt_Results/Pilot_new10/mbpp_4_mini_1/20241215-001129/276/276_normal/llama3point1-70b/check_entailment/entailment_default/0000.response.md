The provided function attempts to find the median of two sorted lists of the same size. It merges the two lists, sorts the merged list, and computes the median based on whether the size is even or odd.

However, there are several critical issues with this implementation:

1. **Incorrect Median Calculation**: When calculating the median, the `middle_index` is assigned as `size - 1`, which is only correct if the size of the merged list is odd. For even sizes, the function is supposed to average the two middle elements located at `size // 2 - 1` and `size // 2`. The implementation currently attempts to access `merged_list[middle_index]` and `merged_list[middle_index + 1]`, which does not guarantee correct behavior for even sizes.

2. **Ignoring Edge Cases**: The function does not handle edge cases, such as when the input lists might be of different sizes or empty lists. The description states that the lists should be of the same size, but there are no checks in place, and the behavior is undefined if the lists do not adhere to this condition.

3. **Reliance on Proper Size Input**: The implementation assumes that the `size` parameter accurately reflects the length of both input lists. If incorrect values are provided for `size`, it may lead to indexing errors or incorrect calculations.

4. **Negative Integers**: The hint mentions the possibility of handling negative integers; however, the median calculation itself does not account for potential issues that might arise with this. The function should still theoretically work with negative integers, but this is an important consideration related to the description.

Overall, the function does not handle all scenarios correctly as outlined in the problem description, leading to potential errors or inaccurate results for cases like even sizes, improper `size` specifications, and lists that may not meet the criteria stipulated.

Correctness: **False**.
