The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `list1`, `list2`, and `size`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of integers, and they are sorted in non-decreasing order. The parameter `size` is a positive integer that is equal to the length of both lists. The function calculates the median value of a merged list derived from `list1` and `list2`. If `size` is even, the function returns the average of the two middle elements of the merged list; if `size` is odd, it returns the middle element of the merged list. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two sorted lists of integers and a size, and return the median value based on the merged list of these two inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two sorted lists of integers, `list1` and `list2`, and a positive integer `size`. It returns the median value of the merged list derived from `list1` and `list2`, using the appropriate calculation based on whether `size` is even or odd.**
