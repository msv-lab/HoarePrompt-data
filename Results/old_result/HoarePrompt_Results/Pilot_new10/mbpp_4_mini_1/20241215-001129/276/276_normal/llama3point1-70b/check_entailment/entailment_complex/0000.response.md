Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement from the problem description of finding the median of two sorted lists of the same size. 

The primary issues are as follows:

1. **Incorrect Median Calculation**: In the program, `middle_index` is calculated as `size - 1`, which only works for odd sizes. For even-sized lists, the program tries to average the two middle values but uses incorrect indexing. The correct middle indices for an even-sized list of length `2*size` should be `size - 1` and `size`, not `size - 1` and `size + 1`.

2. **Assumption of Input Size**: The program assumes `size` is correct and corresponds precisely to the length of both input lists. If the length of the lists does not match `size`, the program's logic would break and either throw an index error or return incorrect results. 

3. **Handling of Edge Cases**: The program does not handle cases where the lists are empty or if the list lengths do not match, meaning it does not meet the specifications safely.

Due to these issues, the function does not reliably compute the median of two sorted lists of the same size as specified in the problem description. Thus, the function cannot be considered correct.
