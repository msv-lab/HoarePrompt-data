Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The assertions included in the code check specific known values for various angles, and the results match the expected outputs for those inputs. 

The formula is mathematically sound, and since it directly derives from the relationship between degrees and radians, it will work for all real number inputs, including negative degrees and values greater than 360 degrees. 

No cases can be found where the program fails to meet the problem description, ensuring that it correctly converts degrees to radians for any valid input.
