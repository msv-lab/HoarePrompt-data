Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \frac{\text{degrees} \times \pi}{180} \). 

Let's analyze it:

1. The function `func_1(deg)` takes an input `deg`, which represents an angle in degrees.
2. It multiplies this input by \( \pi \) and divides by 180, which is the standard mathematical conversion from degrees to radians.

Since the mathematical formula is applied correctly, and there are no edge cases handled improperly (e.g., negative values, zero, or extremely large angles), the program will correctly convert any valid numerical input from degrees to radians.

Therefore, I could not think of any input cases where this code would not behave as expected according to the problem statement. Hence, the program is correct.
