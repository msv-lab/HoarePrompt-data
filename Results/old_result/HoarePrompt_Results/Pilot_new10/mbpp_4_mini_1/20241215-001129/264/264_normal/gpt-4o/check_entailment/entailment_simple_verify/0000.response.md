The original assessment claims that the program is incorrect due to the assertions being placed before the function definition, leading to a potential `NameError`. However, in the provided annotated version of the code, the function `func_1` is indeed executed correctly before raising any assertions because Python allows calling the function even if it's defined later in the code, as long as the definitions are accessible during execution. 

In this case, since the assertions are evaluated prior to the function definition, they would raise a `NameError`, making the program incapable of passing the tests regardless of the function's correctness. Therefore, the original assessment is actually correct in pointing out that there would be an error when executing the assertions.

Final: **False**.
