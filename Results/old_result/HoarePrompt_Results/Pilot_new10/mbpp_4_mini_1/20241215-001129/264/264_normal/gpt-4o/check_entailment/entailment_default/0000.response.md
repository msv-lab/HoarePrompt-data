Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the conversion of degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \left(\frac{\pi}{180}\right) \). The function works as expected for the provided test cases (90, 60, and 120 degrees) and returns the correct radian equivalents. 

The output hints also indicate that the function will accept any numeric value, including negative angles and non-integer values, meaning its behavior is appropriate for a wide range of inputs. Since the implementation correctly handles the described cases without any limitations or errors, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
