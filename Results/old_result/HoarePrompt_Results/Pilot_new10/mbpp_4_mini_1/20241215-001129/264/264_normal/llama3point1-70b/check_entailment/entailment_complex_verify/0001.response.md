Final: **True**

The original assessment was accurate. The provided program correctly implements the mathematical conversion from degrees to radians using the appropriate formula \( \text{radians} = \frac{\text{degrees} \times \pi}{180} \). The annotations confirm that the function accepts a floating-point number representing an angle in degrees and returns its equivalent value in radians.

While it is noted that the function does not handle negative values, this does not affect the correctness of the implementation as long as we assume the input will always be valid, as stated. Therefore, the program behaves as expected according to the problem statement and fulfills its intended purpose effectively.
