Final: **True**

The original assessment is accurate because the program correctly implements the formula to convert degrees to radians. The provided function `func_1` accepts any numeric value representing degrees and accurately performs the conversion using the mathematical relationship \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). The output hints confirm that the function handles all numeric input, including negative angles and non-integer values, without type-checking. Since the problem description requires the function to perform this conversion, and there are no erroneous behaviors indicated by the output hints, the function meets the requirements for correctness.
