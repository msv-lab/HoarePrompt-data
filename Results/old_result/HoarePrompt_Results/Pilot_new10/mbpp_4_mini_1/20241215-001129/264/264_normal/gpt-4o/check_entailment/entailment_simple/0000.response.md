Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function to convert degrees to radians as described in the problem description. 

1. The function `func_1` takes an input parameter `degrees`, which is expected to be a numeric value representing an angle in degrees.
2. Inside the function, it converts the degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). This formula is mathematically correct.
3. The three assert statements check the function's output against known correct values for 90, 60, and 120 degrees, ensuring that the function provides the right conversion for these specific angles:
   - 90 degrees converts to approximately 1.5708 radians.
   - 60 degrees converts to approximately 1.0472 radians.
   - 120 degrees converts to approximately 2.0944 radians.

These checks confirm that the function behaves as expected for the tested values. The mathematical conversion used in the function is universally valid for any input in degrees, thereby satisfying the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. 

Overall, the implementation adheres to the problem specified, confirming that it accurately converts degrees to radians.
