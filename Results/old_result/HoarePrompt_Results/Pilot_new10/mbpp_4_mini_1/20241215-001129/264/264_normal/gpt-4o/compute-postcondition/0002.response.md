Functionality: ** The function accepts a numeric value `degrees` representing an angle in degrees and returns its radian equivalent by multiplying `degrees` by (math.pi / 180). This conversion is valid for any numeric value, including negative angles and non-integer values, as the function will not check or validate the input type. **
