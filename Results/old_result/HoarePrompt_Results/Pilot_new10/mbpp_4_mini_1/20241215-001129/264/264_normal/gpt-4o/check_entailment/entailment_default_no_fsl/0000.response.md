Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description. One specific issue is that the function does not validate the input type. While the conversion formula works correctly for numeric values (including negative angles and non-integer values), it will raise a `TypeError` if a non-numeric value (like a string or None) is passed to the function. This indicates that the function is not robust and does not meet the problem's requirements for all potential cases. 

For example, calling `func_1("90")` will result in an error because the multiplication operation cannot be performed with a string. Thus, the program is not correct as it fails for non-numeric inputs.
