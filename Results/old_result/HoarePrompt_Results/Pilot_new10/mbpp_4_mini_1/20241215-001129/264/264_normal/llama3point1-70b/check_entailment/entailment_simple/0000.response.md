Correctness: **True**

The provided program meets the requirements in the problem description as it correctly implements a function to convert degrees to radians. Here's why it is correct:

1. **Input Type**: The function `func_1` accepts a floating-point number `deg`, which represents an angle in degrees. This aligns with the expected input type for converting degrees to radians.

2. **Conversion Logic**: The conversion from degrees to radians is done using the formula:
   \[
   \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180}
   \]
   The program uses `math.pi` to get the value of Ï€ and divides by 180, which is the correct mathematical operation needed to convert degrees to radians.

3. **Output**: The function returns the radians value calculated from the degrees input, ensuring that it outputs the expected result.

Since the program accurately adheres to the problem description of converting degrees to radians, it is correct.
