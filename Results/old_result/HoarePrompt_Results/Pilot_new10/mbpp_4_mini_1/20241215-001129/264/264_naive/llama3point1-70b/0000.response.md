Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts degrees to radians using the formula \( \text{radians} = \text{degrees} \times \frac{\pi}{180} \). It handles all potential input cases, including positive and negative degree values, as well as zero, which will correctly return zero radians. Since I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the problem description, it is correct.
