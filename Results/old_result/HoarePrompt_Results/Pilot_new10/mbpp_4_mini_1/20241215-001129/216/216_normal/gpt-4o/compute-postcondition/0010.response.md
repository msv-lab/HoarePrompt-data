Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty, `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst` that has at least 3 elements, and `i` is 1. If the difference between the second element `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and the first element `lst_sorted[i]` is not equal to 1, the function returns False. Otherwise, the function continues execution without returning anything.***
