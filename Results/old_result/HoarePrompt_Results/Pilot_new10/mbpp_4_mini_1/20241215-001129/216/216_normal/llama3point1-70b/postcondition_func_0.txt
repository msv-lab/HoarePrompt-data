The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns True if the list contains exactly consecutive integers (e.g., [1, 2, 3] or [5, 6, 7]) without any duplicates, and False otherwise. The function also returns False for empty lists and lists that are not sorted consecutively by one. Additionally, if the list contains duplicate integers or non-consecutive integers, the return value will also be False.
