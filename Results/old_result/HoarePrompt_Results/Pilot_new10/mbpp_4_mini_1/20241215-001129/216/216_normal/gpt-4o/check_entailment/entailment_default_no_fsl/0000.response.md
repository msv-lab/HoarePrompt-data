Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to check for consecutive integers in a list, but it has a flaw. The code assumes that the list contains distinct numbers when checking for consecutive integers. However, if a list contains duplicates, or if there are gaps in the number sequence (beyond just duplicates), the function currently returns `False`, which is incorrect.

For instance, consider the input `[1, 2, 2, 3]`. The sorted version of this list is `[1, 2, 2, 3]`, and while it appears to contain consecutive integers, the presence of the duplicate `2` means it does not form a true consecutive sequence where each number should be unique. Hence, the expected return value for this input should be `False`, which would align with the way the program is currently designed.

Additionally, an example where the functionality fails is:
- Input: `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 5]` should return `False` because of the duplicate `5`, but should return `True` in the current program logic.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the requirement to only consider unique integers when checking for consecutiveness, leading to failures in certain cases.
