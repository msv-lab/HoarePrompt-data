You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))


```
Original Assessment: To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we first dissect the requirements and the code.

### Problem Description
The task requires checking whether a list contains consecutive numbers. 

- Consecutive numbers are defined as numbers that follow one another with no gaps, e.g., [1, 2, 3] or [4, 5, 6, 7].
- If the list contains duplicates or non-consecutive numbers (e.g., [1, 2, 3, 5]), or if it is not sorted, it should not be considered as containing consecutive numbers.

### The Program
```python
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all((lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst)))) and len(lst) == len(set(lst))
```

1. **Sorting the list**: The function begins by sorting the input list.
2. **Checking for consecutive numbers**: 
   - It uses a generator expression to check if every pair of adjacent sorted elements has a difference of exactly 1.
3. **Checking for duplicates**: 
   - It checks that the length of the list is the same as the length of the set of the list (which removes duplicates).

### Considerations
Let's consider cases where the function might not work as expected:

1. **Empty list**: The function returns `True`, because there are no elements to check, but an empty list should be considered as not containing consecutive numbers.
2. **Single element list**: For a list like `[3]`, it returns `True` since there are no pairs to check, yet a single number does not satisfy the requirement for consecutive numbers.
3. **Non-integer elements**: The function does not handle lists with non-integer entries. For instance, for a list like `[1, 2, '3']`, the sort will still work, but the comparison will raise a `TypeError`.
4. **Negatives**: The current implementation assumes positive consecutive integers. For a list like `[-1, 0, 1]`, it would work but if the assumption is only for positive integers, then it would be incorrect.

### Conclusion
Based on the above analysis, I can conclude that:

- The function does not handle the empty list correctly.
- The function does not handle single-element lists correctly.
- The function would fail on lists containing non-integer values.

Since we found at least one case where the function may not work correctly (the empty list case), we conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    lst.sort()
    return all(lst[i] - lst[i - 1] == 1 for i in range(1, len(lst))) and len(lst
    ) == len(set(lst))
    #The program returns True if the sorted list 'lst' contains consecutive integers without duplicates; otherwise, it returns False.


Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
