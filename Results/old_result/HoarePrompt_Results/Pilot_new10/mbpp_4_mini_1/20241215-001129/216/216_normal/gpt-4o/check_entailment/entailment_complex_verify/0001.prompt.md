You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with the program again but this time we are providing you with an annotated version of the program. This annotated version provides the state of the program at different points in the program.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Then use the annotated version to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the annotations and the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False**.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a python function to check whether the given list contains consecutive numbers or not.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True


```
Original Assessment: To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, we analyze the code and check for potential issues.

The problem description states that we need to check whether a given list contains consecutive numbers or not. Hereâ€™s the analysis of the provided code:

```python
def func_1(lst):
    if not lst:
        return False
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
    return True
```

**Analysis:**
1. **Empty List**: The function returns `False` for an empty list, which seems reasonable as there are no consecutive numbers in an empty list.
  
2. **Sorting**: The input list is sorted. This allows the function to check for consecutive numbers correctly by comparing each element with the next one.

3. **Consecutive Check**: The function iterates through the sorted list and checks if the difference between each pair of consecutive numbers is exactly 1. If any pair is found that does not meet this requirement, the function returns `False`. If all pairs satisfy the condition, it returns `True`.

4. **Duplicates**: The function also correctly identifies that duplicates (e.g., `[1, 2, 1]`) should return `False` since they do not represent a set of unique consecutive numbers.

To evaluate the correctness, we can try some edge cases:

- **Single-element list**: The function should return `True` for lists like `[1]` or `[5]` because a single number can be considered a consecutive sequence by itself.
- **Negative numbers**: The function should work with negative numbers as well, so checking for something like `[-3, -2, -1, 0]` should return `True`.
- **Non-consecutive elements**: An input like `[1, 2, 2, 3, 5]` should return `False`, and this is also correctly handled as this list contains duplicates and gaps.
  
Testing with a single element list:
```python
assert func_1([1]) == True  # Should return True
```

After considering the aforementioned cases:
- The function handles empty lists, duplicates, single-element lists, and negative numbers effectively.
- There are no potential input scenarios mentioned that fail based on the problem description.

Given that all tested edge cases hold true, I find no failing case for the provided implementation.

**Correctness: True** 
The function properly checks for the condition of consecutive numbers in all tested scenarios.

Now we are giving you an annotated version of the code describing states at different parts of the program. Make sure that the annotations make sense. 
Also we assume that the input of the program will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program is still correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. It will also not be a problem for example if for input the program expects a  positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Annotated code:
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5]) == True
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 5, 6]) == False
assert func_1([1, 2, 1]) == False

#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of integers.
def func_1(lst):
    if (not lst) :
        return False
        #The program returns False, indicating that the list `lst` is empty.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty.
    lst_sorted = sorted(lst)
    for i in range(len(lst_sorted) - 1):
        if lst_sorted[i + 1] - lst_sorted[i] != 1:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `lst` is a list of integers that is not empty, `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst`, and all elements in `lst_sorted` form a consecutive sequence.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the list 'lst' is not empty and its sorted version 'lst_sorted' forms a consecutive sequence.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers and returns False if the list is empty or if the sorted version of the list does not consist of consecutive integers. If the list is non-empty and all integers form a consecutive sequence, it returns True.

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Does the asnnotated version of the code lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
 You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
