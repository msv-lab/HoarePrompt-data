According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of `lst_sorted`. The loop runs for `len(lst_sorted) - 1` iterations. Since at the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, the next value of `i` will be 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `len(lst_sorted)` must be greater than `i + 1`, which means `len(lst_sorted)` must be greater than 2.

At this point, `lst_sorted` has at least 3 elements, and for the loop to continue, `i` should be 2. Therefore, the state will reflect that:

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty, `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst` that has at least 3 elements, and `i` is 2.**
