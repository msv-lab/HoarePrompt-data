According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. In this case, `i` is currently 0, which means we are in the first iteration of the loop (the first comparison). The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `len(lst_sorted) - 1`. After the current iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` is 0 and `lst_sorted` has at least 2 elements (since it is stated to be the sorted version of a non-empty list of integers). For the loop to be executed one more time, `len(lst_sorted)` must be greater than `i + 1`, which means `len(lst_sorted)` must be greater than 1. Thus, after incrementing `i`, `i` becomes 1.

Since `lst_sorted` has at least 2 elements, the `i + 1` index will point to the second element of `lst_sorted`, which must still satisfy the condition of having the difference between `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and `lst_sorted[i]` equal to 1 for the subsequent loop iteration.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `lst_sorted` must still have at least 3 elements, so that `i` can be 1 and `i + 1` can be 2.

State: **`lst` is a list of integers that is not empty, `lst_sorted` is the sorted version of `lst` that must have at least 3 elements, `i` is 1, and the difference between the second element `lst_sorted[i + 1]` and the first element `lst_sorted[i]` is equal to 1.**
