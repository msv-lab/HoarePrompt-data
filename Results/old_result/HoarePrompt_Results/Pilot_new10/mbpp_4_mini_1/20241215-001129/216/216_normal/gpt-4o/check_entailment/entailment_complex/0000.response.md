Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether the given list contains consecutive numbers. Here's an explanation of how the function meets the requirements of the problem description:

1. **Handling an Empty List**: 
   - The function first checks if the list is empty. If it is, it returns `False`. This behavior is appropriate as an empty list cannot contain consecutive numbers.

2. **Sorting the List**:
   - The function sorts the list of integers. This sorting step is crucial because it prepares the list for the consecutive number check, allowing the function to efficiently determine if the numbers are consecutive.

3. **Checking for Consecutiveness**:
   - The function iterates through the sorted list and checks if the difference between consecutive elements is exactly 1. If any pair of consecutive elements does not have this property, the function returns `False`. This is essential to correctly identifying non-consecutive sequences.

4. **Returning True for Valid Sequences**:
   - If the loop completes without finding any gaps, the function returns `True`, indicating that all integers in the list indeed form a consecutive sequence.

The assertions provided in the program confirm that the function behaves correctly for various test cases:
- The input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` returns `True`, as these numbers are consecutive.
- The input `[1, 2, 3, 5, 6]` returns `False`, as the sequence is broken between 3 and 5.
- The input `[1, 2, 1]` returns `False`, since it does not consist of unique consecutive numbers.

Thus, the function adheres to the requirements of the problem description adequately, and that is why the conclusion is that the program is correct.
