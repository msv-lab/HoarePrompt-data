Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function `func_1` which filters out odd numbers from a list. 

Here is the reasoning:

1. The input list is iterated through with a list comprehension.
2. The condition `num % 2 != 0` correctly checks if a number is odd.
3. The function collects all numbers that satisfy the condition and returns them in a list.

The provided assertions test various scenarios:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]`, the output `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]` correctly includes all odd numbers.
- For the input `[10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]`, the output `[45, 67, 93]` correctly identifies the odd numbers.
- For the input `[5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]`, the output `[5, 7, 9, 3]` again correctly returns the odd numbers.

Since all tested cases yield the expected results and there are no edge cases overlooked (like negative numbers or decimal values which are not part of the problem statement), the function behaves as expected across typical inputs. Thus, the code can be concluded as correct.
