Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to filter odd numbers from a list. However, it is incorrectly defining the condition to filter odd numbers with the expression `num % 2 != 0`. While this condition does correctly identify odd numbers, the problem description does not specify how to handle cases where the input list is empty.

For an input case like `func_1([])`, the expected output should be an empty list `[]`, which the program does correctly return. However, if we extend the scenarios to consider negative odd numbers or very large integers, the program still performs as expected. 

However, the program does not handle the case where non-integer types (like strings or None) could be present in the input list. For example, `func_1([1, 2, 'a', None])` would raise an error during the modulus operation, demonstrating that the program does not account for non-integer inputs, thus making it incorrect.
