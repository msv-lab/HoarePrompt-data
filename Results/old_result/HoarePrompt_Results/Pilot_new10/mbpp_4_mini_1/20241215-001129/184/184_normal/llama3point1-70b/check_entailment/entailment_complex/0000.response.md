Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. The task is to filter odd numbers from a list of integers, and the function `func_1(nums)` does exactly that. 

Hereâ€™s the reasoning:

1. **Input Handling:** The function accepts a list of integers named `nums`, as stated in the problem description.
2. **Filter Logic:** It uses a list comprehension to iterate over each integer in the list and checks if the number is odd using the condition `num % 2 != 0`. 
3. **Return Value:** The function returns a new list containing only the odd integers from the input list. If the list is empty (i.e., `nums` is empty), the returned list is also empty, which aligns with the expected behavior.
4. **No Edge Cases:** The annotations mention that there are no additional edge cases related to the list contents since the function explicitly filters for odd numbers and does not handle non-integer types. This means that only valid integers are considered, which fits the problem goal.

Overall, the function consistently filters out odd numbers and meets all conditions outlined in the problem description. Therefore, it is correct.
