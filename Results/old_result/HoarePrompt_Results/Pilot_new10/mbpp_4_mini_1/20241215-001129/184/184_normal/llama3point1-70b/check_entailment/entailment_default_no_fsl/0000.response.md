Correctness: **False**

The program filters odd numbers from a list of integers; however, the problem description and output hints do not mention that the function solely accepts integers. If a non-integer type (such as a string or a float) is included in the input list `nums`, the program would raise a `TypeError` when verifying whether the non-integer value is odd or even using the modulus operation. Thus, the function does not handle edge cases related to non-integer types appropriately, making the implementation incorrect as it can fail under certain conditions.
