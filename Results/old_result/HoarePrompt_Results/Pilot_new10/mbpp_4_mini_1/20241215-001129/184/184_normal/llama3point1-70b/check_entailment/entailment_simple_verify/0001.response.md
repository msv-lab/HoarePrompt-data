Final: **True**

The original assessment states that the program is incorrect due to its handling of non-integer types, but the annotated version clarifies that the input `nums` is assumed to be a list of integers. Given the problem description explicitly mentions filtering odd numbers from a list, and the annotations confirm that the program treats the input correctly under this assumption, we conclude that the program meets its intended functionality. Therefore, the original assessment was not accurate, and the program is indeed correct as per the provided description and annotations.
