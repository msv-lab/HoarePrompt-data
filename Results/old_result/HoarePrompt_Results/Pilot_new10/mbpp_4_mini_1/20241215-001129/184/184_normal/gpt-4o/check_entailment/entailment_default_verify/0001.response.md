Final: **False**

The original assessment was not accurate because the function `func_1` is stated to return a list of odd integers from the input list `nums`, but it fails to adhere to the requirement fully based on the output hints provided. The output hints indicate that the function should handle elements that may not be integers and filter them out, yet the implementation does not account for this scenario and assumes all input will always be valid.

While the function does filter odd integers correctly from the provided tests, the hints imply that it should also handle cases involving non-integer elements, which the program does not explicitly do. Thus, the lack of consideration for non-integer values reflects an incomplete implementation, leading to the conclusion that the program is not entirely correct in terms of the requirements laid out in the problem description. Hence, the final assessment is **False**.
