You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Given a python program and a problem description, we have performed an initial assessment of the program's correctness. We also provide the reasoning behind our assessment. 
We are additionally providing you with some output hints that summarize the program's functionality.
Your task is to go through the problem descritpion, the program and the original assessment. Use the outut hints to determine if the original assessment was accurate. Then finally provide a final assessment of the program's correctness. Use the format Final: **True** if you believe the program is correct based on the problem description and the output hints anmd the original assessment. Otherwise, use Final: **False** if you belive the program is incorrect since it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Write a function to filter odd numbers.
Program:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10]) == [1, 3, 5, 7, 9]
assert func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93]) == [45, 67, 93]
assert func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3]) == [5, 7, 9, 3]

def func_1(nums):
    return [num for num in nums if num % 2 != 0]


```
Original Assessment: Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to filter out odd numbers from a list. It uses a list comprehension that iterates through the input list `nums` and includes only those numbers that are odd, identified by `num % 2 != 0`.

The assertions provided also check several test cases where the input lists contain both odd and even numbers, and they match the expected output of odd numbers:

1. `func_1([1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 9, 10])` correctly returns `[1, 3, 5, 7, 9]`.
2. `func_1([10, 20, 45, 67, 84, 93])` correctly returns `[45, 67, 93]`.
3. `func_1([5, 7, 9, 8, 6, 4, 3])` correctly returns `[5, 7, 9, 3]`.

Since no potential cases were found where the function fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, the implementation is confirmed to be correct.

Now we are giving you the output hints that summarize the code functionality and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working correctly. Make sure that the output hints make sense. Also we assume that the input will be valid and will not cause any errors in the program. 
So for example if the program is supposed to accept a list but does not handle the case when the input is not a list or an empty list then the program isstill correct since we assume the user will always provide a valid input. The same if we expecta positive integer and the program does not handle the case when the input is negative or zero.
Output hints: 
Output hint for function_1: The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns a new list containing only the odd integers from `nums`. If `nums` is empty, it returns an empty list. The function exclusively filters for odd integers and does not include any even integers or non-integer elements that might exist in the input list. 

Does the original Assessment make sense based on the problem description and the provided code. Do the outpout hints lead you to believe that the original assessment was not accurate?
Use all the information available to you to determine  the final correctness of the program based on the problem description. 
You need to strictly follow the format Final: **True or False**. If you believe the program is correct then Final: **True**. If you believe the program is incorrect then Final: **False**.
If you keep the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is accurate. If you change the original assessment then you need to provide a reason why you think the original assessment is not accurate.
