Correctness: **True**

The function `func_1` correctly implements the requirement to filter odd numbers from a list of integers. It returns a new list containing only those integers that are odd, as specified in the problem description.

Here's why it meets the requirements:

1. **Input**: The function accepts a list of integers (`nums`).
2. **Filtering Logic**: It uses a list comprehension to iterate through each integer in `nums`. For each integer (`num`), it checks whether it is odd using the condition `num % 2 != 0`.
3. **Output**: The function returns a new list that includes only the integers that satisfy the odd number condition.

The provided assertions are also valid examples that demonstrate the correctness of the function. They accurately check that the function returns the expected outputs for lists that include a mix of odd and even integers, confirming that it filters out even integers appropriately.

Given that the logic of the function aligns perfectly with the problem description and correctly handles various cases, the program functions as intended.
