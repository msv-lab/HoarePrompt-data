Based on the provided annotated version of the code, we can conclude that the inputs to the function `func_1` are guaranteed to be positive floats representing the base, height, and length of the triangular prism. Since the original assessment raised concerns about handling zero or negative values, it is important to note that the annotation specifically states that such cases won't occur because the input is assumed to be valid.

Given this assumption, the program correctly calculates the volume of a triangular prism using the required formula, which corresponds to the problem description. Since no potential errors arise from the provided inputs according to the annotations, the program appears to fulfill the requirement of correctly calculating the volume under the defined constraints.

Thus, the original assessment indicating the program does not handle invalid input does not apply since no invalid inputs are being considered in this context.

Final: **True**
