The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `b`, `h`, and `l`. All three parameters are positive floats, where `b` represents the base of the triangular prism, `h` represents the height of the triangular prism, and `l` represents the length of the prism. After executing the function body, it computes the volume of the triangular prism using the formula \((b \times h / 2) \times l\) and returns this volume. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept positive float values for the base, height, and length of a triangular prism and return the computed volume of the prism. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `b`, `h`, and `l`, all positive floats, and returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated using the formula \((b \times h / 2) \times l\).**
