The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `base`, `height`, and `length`. All three parameters are positive floats or integers, where `base` represents the area of the triangular base, `height` represents the height of the triangular prism, and `length` represents the length of the prism. After executing the function body, the function returns the volume of the triangular prism, calculated as \(0.5 \times \text{base} \times \text{height} \times \text{length}\). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept positive float or integer values for `base`, `height`, and `length`, and returns the volume of the triangular prism using these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: base, height, and length, all positive floats or integers, and returns the volume of the triangular prism calculated as 0.5 * base * height * length.**
