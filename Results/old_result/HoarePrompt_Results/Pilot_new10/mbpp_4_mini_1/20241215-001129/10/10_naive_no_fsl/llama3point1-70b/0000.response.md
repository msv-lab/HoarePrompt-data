To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

The problem description requires a function to compute the volume of a triangular prism. The formula for the volume \( V \) of a triangular prism is given by:

\[
V = \text{Base Area} \times \text{Length}
\]

The base area of a triangle is calculated using the formula:

\[
\text{Base Area} = \frac{1}{2} \times b \times h
\]

Where \( b \) is the base length of the triangle and \( h \) is the height of the triangle. Therefore, the complete formula for the volume of a triangular prism would be:

\[
V = \left(\frac{1}{2} \times b \times h\right) \times l
\]

where \( l \) is the length of the prism.

Now, letâ€™s review the program provided:

```python
def func_1(b, h, l):
    return b * h / 2 * l
```

### Breakdown of the code:
- It correctly computes the base area of the triangle using \( b \times h / 2 \).
- It then multiplies the base area by the length \( l \).

### Potential edge cases:
1. **Zero values**: If any of the inputs (b, h, or l) are zero, the function should correctly return 0 because the volume of the prism would indeed be zero.
   - Example: `func_1(0, 5, 10)` should return 0.
  
2. **Negative values**: The function does not explicitly handle negative input values. A negative base, height, or length does not make physical sense for calculating volume. The function would return a negative volume, which is not valid.
   - Example: `func_1(-1, 5, 10)` would return -25, which is incorrect for volume.

3. **Non-numeric input**: The function does not have type checks, so passing a string or other non-numeric type could cause a runtime error.
   - Example: `func_1('a', 5, 10)` would raise a TypeError.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis, the program does not fulfill the problem description for every potential case given the following points:
- It does not handle negative input values correctly, which could lead to invalid volume calculations.
- It lacks input validation for non-numeric types.

Because of these issues, the program is not considered correct.

Correctness: **False**
