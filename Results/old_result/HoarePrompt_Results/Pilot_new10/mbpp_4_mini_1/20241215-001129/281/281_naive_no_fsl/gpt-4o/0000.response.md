Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality to find even numbers from a list of numbers. The logic used inside the function `func_1` iterates through each number in the input list and checks if it is even using the condition `num % 2 == 0`. 

### Explanation of correctness:
- For the input `[1, 2, 3, 4, 5]`, the output `[2, 4]` correctly identifies the even numbers.
- For the input `[4, 5, 6, 7, 8, 0, 1]`, the output `[4, 6, 8, 0]` includes all even numbers in the list, including zero, which is correctly considered an even number.
- For the input `[8, 12, 15, 19]`, the output `[8, 12]` again correctly identifies the even numbers.

Given the nature of even numbers (any integer divisible by 2), the implemented function will accurately return all even numbers for any list of integers. There are no missing edge cases or logic flaws in the current implementation. Thus, it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
