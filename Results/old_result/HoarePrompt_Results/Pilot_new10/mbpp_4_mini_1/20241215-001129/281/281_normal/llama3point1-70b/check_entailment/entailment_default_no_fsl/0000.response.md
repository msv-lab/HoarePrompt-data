Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1(numbers)` accurately implements the requirements of the problem description. It employs a list comprehension to filter out even numbers from the input list of integers. 

The function checks every number in the input list using the condition `num % 2 == 0`, which correctly identifies even numbers. If there are no even numbers, it returns an empty list, as expected by the output hints. Moreover, in the case of an empty input list, it also returns an empty list, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the output hints.

No edge cases were identified that would make this program fail to meet the problem's requirements for any potential input. Thus, the program is correct in all identified scenarios.
