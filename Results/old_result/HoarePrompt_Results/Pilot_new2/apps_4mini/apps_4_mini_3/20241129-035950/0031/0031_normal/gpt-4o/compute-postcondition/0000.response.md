The variable `MOD` is assigned the value `10 ** 6 + 3`, which calculates to `1000003`. The states of the other variables `n` and `k` remain unchanged as their values were not directly affected by the assignment of `MOD`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003**.
