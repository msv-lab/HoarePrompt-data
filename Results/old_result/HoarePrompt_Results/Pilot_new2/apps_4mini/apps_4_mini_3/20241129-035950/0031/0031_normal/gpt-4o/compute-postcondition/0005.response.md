`total_days` is assigned the value of `1 << n`, which represents 2 raised to the power of `n`. Given that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `total_days` will be a very large integer, specifically equal to \(2^n\). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `k` is less than or equal to 1 << n, `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\)**.
