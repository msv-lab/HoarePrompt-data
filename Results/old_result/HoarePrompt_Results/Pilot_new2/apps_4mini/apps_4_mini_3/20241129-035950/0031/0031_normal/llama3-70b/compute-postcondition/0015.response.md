The value of `denominator` is updated by dividing it by `gcd`. The value of `gcd` depends on the value of `k`. If `k` is 3 or greater, `gcd` is \(2^k\), and `denominator` will be \( \frac{2^k}{2^k} = 1\). If `k` is equal to 2, then `gcd` is 2, and `denominator` will be \( \frac{2^2}{2} = 2\). Therefore, the output state will depend on the specific value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to 2; if `k` ≥ 3, then `denominator` is 1; if `k` = 2, then `denominator` is 2; if `k` ≥ 3, then `numerator` is 0, `gcd` is \(2^k\); if `k` = 2, then `numerator` is 1, `gcd` is 2.**
