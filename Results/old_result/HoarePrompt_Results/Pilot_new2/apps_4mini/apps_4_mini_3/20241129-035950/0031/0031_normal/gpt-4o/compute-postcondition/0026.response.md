Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `k` is less than or equal to 1 << n; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to 2^n; `numerator` is equal to the product of ((2^n) - i) for i from 0 to k-1 modulo 1000003; `denominator` is equal to (total_days^k) % 1000003; `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`; `p_total` is equal to `denominator`; `p_shared` is equal to (denominator - numerator + 1000003) % 1000003; `A` is equal to `p_shared // g`; `B` is equal to `p_total // g`; `print` outputs `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`.**
