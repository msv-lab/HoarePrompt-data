The code `print(1, 1)` outputs the values `1` and `1` but does not change any variables in the program. Therefore, the state of the variables remains unchanged, and we simply note the output.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and the current value of `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by the value of `n` (k > 1 << n); the output is 1 and 1.**
