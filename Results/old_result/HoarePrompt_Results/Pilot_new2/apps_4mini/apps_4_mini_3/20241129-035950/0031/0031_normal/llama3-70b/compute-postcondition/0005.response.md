The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it by `total_days`. The previous value of `denominator` is 1 and `total_days` is 2, so the new value of `denominator` becomes 1 * 2, which is 2. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to 2, `numerator` is equal to 2, `denominator` is equal to 2, `i` is 0**
