To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and examine the code.

### Problem Breakdown
- Given `n`, the total number of days is `2^n`.
- Given `k`, the number of people interviewed.
- We need to calculate the probability that at least two of the `k` people share a birthday.
- The probability can be expressed as an irreducible fraction `A/B`.
- The output should be `A` and `B` modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Key Considerations
1. **Special Cases**:
   - If `k > 2^n`, then it's guaranteed that at least two people will have the same birthday (since there are more people than available days).
   - The output in this case should be `1 1`.
   
2. **Normal Case Logic**:
   - The code multiplies the numerator by the number of available days minus the number of previously selected birthdays for `k` people, and the denominator is simply `total_days` raised to the power of `k` (which is `2^n`).
   - Then it reduces the fraction using the GCD.

### Review of the Program
The provided code is as follows:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    total_days = 2 ** n
    numerator = 1
    denominator = 1
    for i in range(k):
        numerator *= total_days - i
        denominator *= total_days
    gcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)
    numerator //= gcd
    denominator //= gcd
    return (numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3), denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3))

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
(A, B) = func_1(n, k)
print(A, B)
```

### Identifying Issues
1. **Missing Special Case Handling**:
   - The code does not handle the case where `k > total_days`. In such cases, the output should be `1 1`, but the algorithm will incorrectly compute the numerator and denominator, leading to incorrect results.
   - For example, with `n = 1` and `k = 3`, the correct output should be `1 1`, but the code would attempt to multiply `total_days` in the loop, which is incorrect.

2. **Performance with Large `n` and `k`**:
   - Given the constraints (up to `10^18`), the multiplication of large numbers without any checks might lead to overflow or unintended behavior in Python as well.

### Conclusion
The program fails to account for scenarios where `k > total_days`. Hence, it is incomplete and incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for at least one input case.

Correctness: **False**.
