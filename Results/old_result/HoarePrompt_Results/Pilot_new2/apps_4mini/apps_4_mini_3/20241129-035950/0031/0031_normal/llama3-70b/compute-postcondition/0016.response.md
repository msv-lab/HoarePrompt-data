To determine the output state based on the initial conditions and the provided code snippet, we will analyze the values of `numerator` and `denominator` according to the value of `k`.

1. Since `k` is an integer such that \(2 ≤ k ≤ 10^{18}\), we identify two cases:
   - If \(k \geq 3\):
     - `numerator` is 0.
     - `denominator` is 1.
     - `gcd` is \(2^k\) (not directly used in the return).
   - If \(k = 2\):
     - `numerator` is 1.
     - `denominator` is 2.
     - `gcd` is 2 (not directly used in the return).

2. The return statement is:
   ```python
   return numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3), denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)
   ```

3. The value of \(10^6 + 3\) is \(1000003\).

4. Let's calculate the outputs for both cases:
   - **Case 1** (\(k \geq 3\)):
     - `numerator` is 0, so \(0 \mod 1000003 = 0\).
     - `denominator` is 1, so \(1 \mod 1000003 = 1\).
     - The output would be `(0, 1)`.

   - **Case 2** (\(k = 2\)):
     - `numerator` is 1, so \(1 \mod 1000003 = 1\).
     - `denominator` is 2, so \(2 \mod 1000003 = 2\).
     - The output would be `(1, 2)`.

Now, we summarize the possible output states.

Output State: **The program returns (0, 1) if k is greater than or equal to 3, or (1, 2) if k equals 2.**
