Correctness: **False**

The provided program incorrectly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length `y` starting from a triangle of side length `x`. The program simply outputs the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which does not accurately reflect the number of steps needed to transition from one triangle to another while maintaining the properties of a non-degenerate triangle (all sides positive and staying as equal lengths).

For example, consider the test case where `x = 6` and `y = 3`. The expected output is 4 seconds, as shown in the problem description:

1. (6, 6, 6) → (6, 6, 3) (1 second)
2. (6, 6, 3) → (6, 5, 3) (2 seconds)
3. (6, 5, 3) → (5, 5, 3) (3 seconds)
4. (5, 5, 3) → (3, 3, 3) (4 seconds)

However, the program would output `abs(6 - 3) = 3`, which is incorrect. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.
