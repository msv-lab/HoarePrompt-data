Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of the integer value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed, or '0' if `a` is empty; `b` is '0' if it was empty; `data` remains unchanged as a list of strings obtained from splitting the input. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, '<' is printed. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, '>' is printed. If the lengths are equal, the outputs are determined by comparing `a` and `b`: if `a` is less than `b`, '<' is printed; if `a` is greater than `b`, '>' is printed; otherwise, '=' is printed.***
