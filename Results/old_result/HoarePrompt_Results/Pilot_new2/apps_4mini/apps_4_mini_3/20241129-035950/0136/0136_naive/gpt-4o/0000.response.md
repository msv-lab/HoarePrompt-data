Correctness: **False**.

The program attempts to compare two very large integers represented as strings while handling potential leading zeros. However, it fails to handle the case where both inputs are entirely made up of zeros. For example, if both inputs are "0000" and "0000", the program would incorrectly return '=' because it does not explicitly check for equality after stripping leading zeros. The correct behavior should confirm that both are equal and should print '='. However, if the input is "0000" and "000", the program would also return '=' due to the same logic flaw.

Additionally, the program does not handle the case where both `a` and `b` are empty after leading zero stripping, which could lead to unintended behavior. Therefore, the handling of such cases is insufficient, and the program is incorrect.
