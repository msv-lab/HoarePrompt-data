Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle cases where the input integers are comprised solely of leading zeros, which would result in an empty string after the `lstrip('0')` operation. For example:

Input:
```
0000
0000
```

The program will execute `a = input().lstrip('0')` and `b = input().lstrip('0')`, resulting in both `a` and `b` being empty strings. When it evaluates `if a == b:`, it will incorrectly conclude that the numbers are equal and print `=`.

The correct behavior for the above input should be that both integers are equal, but since the program does not handle the case of both numbers being entirely made of zeros, it cannot be guaranteed to work correctly for all potential inputs.
