The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. Each string may contain leading zeroes and has a length of at most 10^6 characters. The function performs operations on these string representations of integers and returns a result based on these inputs. 

Since the output details were not provided, I will conclude the description based solely on the parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, which are non-negative integers represented as strings. Each string can contain leading zeroes and has a maximum length of 10^6 characters.**
