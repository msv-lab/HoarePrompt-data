Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of the integer value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed, or '0' if `a` is empty. If `b` is empty, then `b` is set to '0'. `data` remains unchanged as a list of strings obtained from splitting the input. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, and the current length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`.***
