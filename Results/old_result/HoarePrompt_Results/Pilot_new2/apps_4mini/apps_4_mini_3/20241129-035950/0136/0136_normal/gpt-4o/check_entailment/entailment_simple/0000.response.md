Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it adheres to the specifications:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads the entire input line and splits it into two strings, `a` and `b`, which is in line with the requirement to read large integers in one go. This is efficient for handling the potentially large size of the input.

2. **Leading Zero Removal**: The program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeros from both `a` and `b`. If a string becomes empty (which would happen if the original string was just zeros), it assigns '0' to that variable. This ensures the comparisons are accurate, as leading zeros do not affect the numerical value.

3. **Length Comparison**: The program checks the lengths of `a` and `b` after removing leading zeros. If the length of `a` is less than that of `b`, it correctly prints '<', and if the length of `a` is greater, it prints '>'. This aligns with the numerical comparison rules.

4. **Lexicographical Comparison**: If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, the program uses lexicographical comparison for strings to determine their order. This is valid because when two numbers have the same number of digits, comparing them lexicographically yields the same result as comparing their integer values.

5. **Output**: The program prints the appropriate symbols ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparisons made, which fulfills the output requirements of the problem description.

6. **Edge Cases**: The program correctly handles edge cases such as numbers that are entirely zeros (e.g., '0000' vs '0'), ensuring that it does not produce incorrect results due to leading zeros.

Overall, the program's logic and flow ensure that it can accurately compare any two given non-negative integers represented as strings, regardless of their length or leading zeros, which aligns perfectly with the problem description's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
