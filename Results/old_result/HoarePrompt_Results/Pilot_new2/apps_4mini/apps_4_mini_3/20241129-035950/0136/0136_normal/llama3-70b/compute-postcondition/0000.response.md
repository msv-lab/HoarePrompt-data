In the provided code snippet, `a` is assigned the value of the input with leading zeroes removed. Since `a` is initially a non-negative integer represented as a string, applying `lstrip('0')` will strip the leading zeroes, leaving the rest of the string unchanged.

1. If `a` is "0000123", after executing the line of code, `a` will be changed to "123".
2. If `a` is "0000", after executing the line of code, `a` will become an empty string "".
3. The variable `b` remains unaffected since it is not mentioned or altered in the code.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the new value of `a` and the unchanged state of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeroes; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string that may contain leading zeroes.**
