The variable `data` is assigned the value resulting from calling `input()` and then splitting that input string into a list. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. However, `data` will hold a list of strings that are the split parts of the input, which may include `a` and `b` if they are provided in the input.

Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
