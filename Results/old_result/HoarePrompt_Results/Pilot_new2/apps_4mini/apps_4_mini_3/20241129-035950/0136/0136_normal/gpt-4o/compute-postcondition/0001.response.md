The value of `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed using the `lstrip('0')` method. `b` and `data` remain unchanged. Since `a` is a string representing a non-negative integer, after removing leading zeros, if `data[0]` was initially '000123', `a` would become '123'. If `data[0]` was '0', `a` would become an empty string. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `a` while retaining the non-negative integer condition for `b` and the list structure of `data`.

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of the integer value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string; `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
