The function reads three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, which represent the number of buying prices, selling prices, and available bourles respectively. It then reads two lists: `s`, containing `n` buying prices, and `b`, containing `m` selling prices. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it prints the available bourles `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r` using the minimum buying price, determines the remaining bourles after buying those shares, and computes the total bourles that would be obtained by selling the shares at the maximum selling price plus the remaining bourles. The function does not accept parameters directly but interacts with user input instead.
