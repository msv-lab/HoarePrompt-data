Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers (1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000). If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, the function returns the value of `r`. Otherwise, the function calculates `max_shares` as `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` as `r % min_buy_price`, and prints the total amount of bourles calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`.***
