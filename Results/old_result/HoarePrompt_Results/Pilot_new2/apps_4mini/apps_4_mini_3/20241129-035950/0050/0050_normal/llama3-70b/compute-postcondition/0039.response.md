The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is greater than 1, `shares` is 0, `r` is the remaining amount after distributing shares according to the integers in `s`, `i` is 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
