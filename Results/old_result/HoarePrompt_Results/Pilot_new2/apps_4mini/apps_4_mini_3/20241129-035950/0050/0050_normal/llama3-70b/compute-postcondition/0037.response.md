The value of `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]` to it. The initial state indicates that `shares` is 0, so the entire expression `shares * b[i]` evaluates to 0 regardless of the value of `b[i]`. Therefore, `r` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is greater than 1, `shares` is 0, `r` remains unchanged, `i` is 2**
