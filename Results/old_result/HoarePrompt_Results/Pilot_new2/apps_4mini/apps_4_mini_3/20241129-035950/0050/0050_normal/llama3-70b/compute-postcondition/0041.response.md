Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `shares` is 0, `r` is updated to the remaining amount after distributing shares according to the integers in `s`, which contains at least `n` elements. The loop executes a maximum of `m` times or until `shares` is greater than 0, whichever comes first. If the loop does not execute, `shares` remains the original value calculated from `s` and `r` remains unchanged.**
