Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is greater than 1, `shares` is 0, and `r` remains unchanged if `shares` is greater than 0. Otherwise, `r` is the remaining amount after distributing shares according to the integers in `s`, and `i` is 2, with a break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
