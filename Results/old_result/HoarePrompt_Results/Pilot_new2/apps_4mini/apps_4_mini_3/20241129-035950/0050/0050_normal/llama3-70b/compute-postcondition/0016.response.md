The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `shares` remains unchanged, `i` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
