Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `shares` is 0, and `r` is updated to `r + shares * b[0]` if `shares` was greater than 0. If `shares` was not greater than 0, then `r` remains as the remaining amount after distributing shares according to the integers in `s`. In either case, `s` contains at least `n` elements and `i` is 0.***
