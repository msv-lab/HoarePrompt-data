Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is greater than 1, `shares` is 0, and if `shares` were greater than 0, `r` remains unchanged. If `shares` is not greater than 0, then `r` is the remaining amount after distributing shares according to the integers in `s`, which contains at least `n` elements, and `i` is 1, while breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
