The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters based on the provided definition. However, it operates on the following expected inputs:

- `n`: a positive integer where \(1 \leq n \leq 30\).
- `m`: a positive integer where \(1 \leq m \leq 30\).
- `r`: a positive integer where \(1 \leq r \leq 1000\).
- `s`: a list of `n` positive integers where each integer \(s_i\) (\(1 \leq s_i \leq 1000\)) represents the price to buy shares.
- `b`: a list of `m` positive integers where each integer \(b_i\) (\(1 \leq b_i \leq 1000\)) represents the price to sell shares.

Based on the output description, the function performs certain operations with these inputs.

Functionality: **The function works with positive integers `n`, `m`, `r`, and lists `s` and `b` representing share prices, but it does not take parameters directly.**
