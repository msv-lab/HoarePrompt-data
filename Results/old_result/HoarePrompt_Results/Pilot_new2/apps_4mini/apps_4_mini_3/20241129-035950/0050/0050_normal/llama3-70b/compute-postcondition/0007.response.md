Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an integer between 1 and 30, `r` is an integer between 1 and 1000, `s` is a sorted list of integers, `b` is a list of integers sorted in reverse order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0 (for the first iteration). The current value of `r` is greater than or equal to the first element of the sorted list `s` (i.e., `s[0]`), which is represented by `s[i]`.***
