Postcondition: ***`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of `n` positive integers parsed from input, `b` is a list of `m` integers parsed from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. The current value of `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`.***
