According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, decrementing `i` by `1` in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k - 1 - 1`, which is `k - 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be decremented again to `k - 2 - 1`, which results in `i` being `k - 3`. 

The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be at least `-1`, which means `k` must be at least `2` to allow `i` to decrement to `-1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `k` is still a positive integer that satisfies `1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10`, and `min_sum` remains less than or equal to `n`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `remainder` is -2, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1, and `i` is `k - 2`.**
