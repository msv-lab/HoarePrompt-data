`min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers. The values of `n` and `k` are still positive integers within the specified range, but `min_sum` is now defined. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`.**
