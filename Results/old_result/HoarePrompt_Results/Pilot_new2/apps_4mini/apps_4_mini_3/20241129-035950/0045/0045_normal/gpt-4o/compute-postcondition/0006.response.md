To analyze the impact of the provided code snippet on the initial state, we start with the following information:

- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{10} \)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^{10} \)
- `min_sum` is equal to \( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \) and is less than or equal to `n`
- `d` is equal to \( \frac{n}{(k \cdot (k + 1)) / 2} \)
- `remainder` is equal to \( n - d \cdot \left(\frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2}\right) \)

Now, executing the code snippet:

```python
sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
```

This line creates a list called `sequence` that contains `k` elements. Each element is calculated as \( d \cdot (i + 1) \) for \( i \) ranging from 0 to \( k-1 \). 

Let's break down the calculations:
- For \( i = 0 \), the first element will be \( d \cdot (0 + 1) = d \)
- For \( i = 1 \), the second element will be \( d \cdot (1 + 1) = 2d \)
- For \( i = 2 \), the third element will be \( d \cdot (2 + 1) = 3d \)
- ...
- For \( i = k - 1 \), the last element will be \( d \cdot (k) \)

Thus, the `sequence` becomes:

\[ \text{sequence} = [d, 2d, 3d, \ldots, kd] \]

The values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `remainder` remain unchanged as the operation only computes a new list based on the current values of `d`.

Therefore, the output state retains all original variables but updates or adds the new variable `sequence`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`; `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`; `d` is equal to `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`; `remainder` is equal to `n - d * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`; `sequence` is equal to `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`.**
