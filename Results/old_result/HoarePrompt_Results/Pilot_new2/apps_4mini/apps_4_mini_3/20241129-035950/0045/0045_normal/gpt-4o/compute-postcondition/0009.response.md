The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `remainder` is equal to `n - d * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, `sequence` is equal to `[d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd]`, `i` is `k - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
