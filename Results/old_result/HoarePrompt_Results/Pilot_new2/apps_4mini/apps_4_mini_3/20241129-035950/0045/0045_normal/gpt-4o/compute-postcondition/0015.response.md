Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n`, `remainder` is equal to -1, `d` is equal to `n // (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, and if `remainder` is 0, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
