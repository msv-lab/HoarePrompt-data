Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: The program calculates `min_sum`, which is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, using the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`. This ensures that the sum of any strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers is at least this value. If `min_sum` exceeds `n`, it is impossible to form such a sequence, and the program correctly returns `-1`.

2. **Finding the Greatest Common Divisor**: The program then calculates `d = n // min_sum`, which determines how many times the minimum required sum can fit into `n`. This value `d` is used to create a base sequence where each element is multiplied by `d`, ensuring that the GCD of the sequence is maximized. The sequence is initialized as `sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]`, which creates the strictly increasing sequence starting from `d` (when `i=0`) to `d * k` (when `i=k-1`).

3. **Distributing the Remainder**: The program calculates a `remainder` and distributes it across the sequence elements one by one by incrementing the elements from the end of the list towards the start. This ensures that the sequence remains strictly increasing since we only increase the elements.

4. **Output**: Finally, the function returns the generated sequence. The sequence has the required properties: it is strictly increasing, its sum equals `n`, and the GCD is maximized.

The implementation adheres to the constraints and requirements laid out in the problem description. It correctly handles cases where it's impossible to create a valid sequence (by returning `-1`), and it ensures that when a sequence is possible, it maximizes the GCD and maintains strict increasing order. Thus, the program is correct for all potential cases defined by the problem statement.
