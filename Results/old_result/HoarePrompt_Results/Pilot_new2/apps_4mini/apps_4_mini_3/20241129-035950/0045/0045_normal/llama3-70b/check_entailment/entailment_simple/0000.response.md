Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem requires creating an increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n` and have a maximum possible greatest common divisor (GCD). 

However, the annotated program is solely focused on calculating the GCD of `n` and `k` and does not construct any sequence of numbers. Additionally, it does not check the feasibility of forming such a sequence nor does it generate the sequence according to the given constraints. 

For example, if `n = 6` and `k = 3`, the program does not create the sequence `[1, 2, 3]` but merely returns the GCD of `6` and `3`, which is `3`. 

Furthermore, if `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the program does not handle the case of outputting `-1` when a sequence cannot be formed, as it does not even attempt to construct or validate any sequence.

In summary, the program fails to:
1. Generate a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sums to `n`.
2. Ensure the output meets the conditions specified (i.e., if no sequence can be formed, it should return `-1`).

Thus, the program is incorrect concerning the problem description.
