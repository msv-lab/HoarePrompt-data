Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be formed, with 1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears per set, and prints the total number of fruits in all sets. However, it does not return any value; it only prints the result. Additionally, it does not handle cases where the inputs are outside the specified constraints or invalid input types, which could lead to runtime errors. **
