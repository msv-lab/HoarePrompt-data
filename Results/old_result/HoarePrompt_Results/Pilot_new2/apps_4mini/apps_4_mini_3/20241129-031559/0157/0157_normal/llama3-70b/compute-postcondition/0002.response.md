The value of `c` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are unaffected by this code. The state of `c` will now reflect the new input integer value assigned to it. 

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer**
