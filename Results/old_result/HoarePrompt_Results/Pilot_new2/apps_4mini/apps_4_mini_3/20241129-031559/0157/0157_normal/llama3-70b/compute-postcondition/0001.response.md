In this case, `b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an integer input. The values of `a` and `c` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the new value of `b` as an input integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer**
