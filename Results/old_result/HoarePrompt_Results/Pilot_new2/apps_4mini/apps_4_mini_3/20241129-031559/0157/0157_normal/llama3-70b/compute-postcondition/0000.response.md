`a` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial states of `b` and `c` remain unchanged, while `a` will take on the specific input value. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `a` is now the input integer, while `b` and `c` are still positive integers within their defined range.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is a positive integer, `c` is a positive integer**.
