The value of `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum of three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Here, `a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, and `c` is an input integer. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `min_lemon` based on the calculations.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.**
