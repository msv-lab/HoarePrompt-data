Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. Here is the breakdown of how it adheres to the specifications:

1. **Input Handling**: The function reads three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. This is in accordance with the problem description.

2. **Calculating Minimum Fruits Needed**: The program computes `min_lemon` using `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This correctly finds the maximum number of complete sets of fruits (1 lemon, 2 apples, 4 pears) that can be made without exceeding the available quantities:
   - `a` represents the number of lemons directly.
   - `b // 2` gives the maximum number of lemons that can be supported by apples (since 2 apples are needed for each lemon).
   - `c // 4` gives the maximum number of lemons that can be supported by pears (since 4 pears are needed for each lemon).

3. **Output Calculation**: After determining `min_lemon`, the program calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `7 * min_lemon`. This correctly calculates the total number of fruits used based on the number of complete sets of fruits that can be made.

4. **Handling Edge Cases**: If `min_lemon` is 0 (which occurs when there are insufficient fruits to make even a single set), the function will output 0, which is consistent with the problem statement that states it is possible that Nikolay can't use any fruits.

In conclusion, the algorithm efficiently calculates the maximum number of fruits Nikolay can use to make the compote based on the given ratios and handles all potential cases properly, thus fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
