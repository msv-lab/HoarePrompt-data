The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each of these parameters is a positive integer representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has, respectively, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function returns a value based on these parameters. 

However, the output specification is missing from the provided details, which prevents us from determining the specific return value of the function. Thus, we cannot describe the functionality accurately without knowing the logic related to the output.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters a, b, and c, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has, respectively. It returns a value based on these inputs.**
