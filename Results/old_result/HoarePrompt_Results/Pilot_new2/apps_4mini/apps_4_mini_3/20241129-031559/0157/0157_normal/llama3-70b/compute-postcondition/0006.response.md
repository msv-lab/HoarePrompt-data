Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input, which represent the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively. It calculates the minimum value among `a`, half of `b`, and a quarter of `c`. The function then computes and prints a total based on this minimum value, specifically `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which results in `7 * min_lemon`. The function does not return any value; instead, it outputs the result directly. **
