The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is known to be 0. Therefore, after executing the code, `i` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, including `s`, `target`, `target_len`, and `j`. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; if the value of `s[i]` is equal to 'a', then `j` is incremented to 1.**
