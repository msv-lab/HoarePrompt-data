The code snippet provided replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the next character in the ASCII sequence, which is `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. Given that `char` is `final_char + 1` and `final_char` is less than 'y', it follows that `char` can be 'a' to 'x'. The conditions ensure that replacing `char` will not produce a character that is out of bounds (e.g., exceeding 'z').

After executing the code, `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the character that follows it in the ASCII table. The variable `res` is stated to be incremented by `char`, but since we are not given the specific value of `res` and it is not modified in the code, we will leave it as it is.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect the updated string `s` and maintain the other variables' states as valid under the given conditions.

Output State: **`s` is the original string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by `char + 1`, `char` is `final_char + 1`, and `final_char` is less than 'y'; `res` is incremented by `char`.**
