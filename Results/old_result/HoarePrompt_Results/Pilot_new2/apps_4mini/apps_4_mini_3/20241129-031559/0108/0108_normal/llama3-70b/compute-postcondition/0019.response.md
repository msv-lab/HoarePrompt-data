The variable `res` is assigned the value of itself concatenated with `char`. Since `char` is defined as `final_char + 2`, and `final_char` is less than 'y', `char` will be a character that falls within a defined range. This means `res` will now contain additional repeated instances of `char`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` must contain `char`, `char` is `final_char + 2`, `res` contains repeated instances of each character from 'a' to `final_char` followed by additional instances of `char`, `original_s` must have contained characters from 'a' to `final_char`, and `final_char` must be less than 'y'.**
