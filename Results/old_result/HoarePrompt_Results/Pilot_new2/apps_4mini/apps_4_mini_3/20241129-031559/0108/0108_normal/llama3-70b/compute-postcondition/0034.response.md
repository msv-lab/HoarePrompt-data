The variable `s` is modified by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table, which is `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. The `final_char` is stated to be less than 'y', meaning it cannot be 'y' or higher in the ASCII table. Since `char` is also involved in the replacement, we can infer that the value of `s` will change based on this replacement.

The value of `res` does not change in this operation, as it is noted that it is equal to its previous value plus `char`, so its state remains the same.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code execution, so we summarize the output state reflecting the updates.

Output State: **`s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the character that follows it in ASCII, `final_char` is less than 'y', and `res` remains equal to its previous value plus `char`.**
