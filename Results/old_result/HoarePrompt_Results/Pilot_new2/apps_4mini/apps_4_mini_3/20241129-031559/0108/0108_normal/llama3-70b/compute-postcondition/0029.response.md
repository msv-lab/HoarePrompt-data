According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being present in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is `final_char + 1` and `final_char` is less than 'y', which implies that `char` is a character from 'b' to 'y'. Since `s` originally contained characters from 'a' to `final_char`, and `char` is `final_char + 1`, it is not guaranteed that `char` will be present in `s` for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `s` still contains the character `char`. Therefore, `s` must be adjusted such that it includes the character `char` at least once. Since `char` is `final_char + 1`, `s` must be modified to include this character.

State: **`s` must include the character `char`, where `char` is `final_char + 1`, and `final_char` is less than 'y'.**
