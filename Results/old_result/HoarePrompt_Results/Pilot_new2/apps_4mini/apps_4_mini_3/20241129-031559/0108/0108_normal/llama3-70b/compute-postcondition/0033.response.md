The code `res += char` adds the value of `char` to `res`. The initial state indicates that `s` must contain `char`, and `final_char` is less than 'y'. Since we don't have specific values for `res` or `char`, we can only describe the relationship.

Since `s` contains `char`, `char` is some character that meets the criteria. The value of `res` will now include `char` appended to its previous value.

The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` must contain `char`, `final_char` is less than 'y', and `res` is now equal to its previous value plus `char`.**
