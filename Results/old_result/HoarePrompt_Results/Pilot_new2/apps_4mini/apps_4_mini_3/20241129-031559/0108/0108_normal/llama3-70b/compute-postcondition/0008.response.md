The value of `res` is incremented by concatenating `char` to it. Since `res` is initially 'a' and `char` is also 'a', the new value of `res` becomes 'aa'. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` must include 'b' and `s` must include 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
