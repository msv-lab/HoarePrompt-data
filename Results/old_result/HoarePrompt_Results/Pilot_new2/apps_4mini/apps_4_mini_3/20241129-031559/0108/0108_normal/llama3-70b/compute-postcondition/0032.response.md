According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. The condition `char in s` means that the loop will continue as long as `char` is found within `s`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `char` is `final_char + 1`, and `final_char` is less than 'y'. This means that `char` is currently one character beyond `final_char`, and since `final_char` is less than 'y', `char` must currently be less than 'z'. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must still contain the current value of `char`. Since `char` has been modified to `final_char + 1` in the previous iteration, we need to ensure that `s` must contain this updated `char`.

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `s` contains `char` (which is `final_char + 1`) for the loop to execute again. There are no other adjustments needed based on the provided state.

State: **`s` must contain `char` (which is `final_char + 1`), and `final_char` is less than 'y'**
