The code `print(-1)` outputs the value `-1`, but it does not change any variables or their states. The previously defined variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is as follows:

Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to the number of characters from `target` that were found in `s` in order, which is between 0 and 25. Not all characters of `target` were found in `s` in order.**
