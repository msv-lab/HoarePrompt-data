Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and then reads `n` lines of 6 integers each, representing the digits on the faces of cubes. It collects all unique digits from these inputs, removes '0' if present, and constructs the largest possible integer by sorting the remaining digits in descending order. The resulting integer is then printed.**
