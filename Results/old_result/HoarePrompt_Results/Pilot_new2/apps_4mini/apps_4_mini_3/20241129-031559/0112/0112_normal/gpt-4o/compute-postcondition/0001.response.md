The line of code initializes `used_cubes` as a list of length `n`, where each element is set to `False`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` will either be a list with one, two, or three `False` values. The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, all set to `False`.**
