The variable `used_cubes[i]` is assigned the value `True`, indicating that the cube at index `i` has now been used. Other variables are not affected by this operation. The conditions for `n`, `digits`, `digit`, `found`, and the status of other cubes remain the same.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `used_cubes` reflects which cubes were used with `used_cubes[i]` is True, `i` is 0, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`.**
