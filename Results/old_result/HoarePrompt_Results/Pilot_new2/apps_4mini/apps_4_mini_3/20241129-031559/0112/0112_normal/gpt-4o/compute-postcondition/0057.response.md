The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters; `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list; `i` is 3; `used_cubes[3]` is True; `found` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
