The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is 0, and `used_cubes[0]` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
