Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list. After all iterations, `found` is True if at least one `used_cubes[i]` was set to True where `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. `used_cubes` reflects the status of all cubes, with `True` for those that matched the condition during the loop execution, and `False` for those that did not. If no cubes matched, `used_cubes` remains unchanged from its initial state.**
