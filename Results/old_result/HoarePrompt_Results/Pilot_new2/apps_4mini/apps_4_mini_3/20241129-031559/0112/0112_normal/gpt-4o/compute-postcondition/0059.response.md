According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than 3.

Since `i` is incremented by 1 in the next iteration, `i` will become 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 4.

State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `i` is 4**
