In this code snippet, `cubes` is assigned a list of lists. The size of the outer list is determined by `n`, which is an integer within the range 1 to 3. `input().split()` takes input from the user, and `map(int, ...)` converts each split string input into an integer.

Assuming `n` is a specific integer value within the range (1, 2, or 3), the variable `cubes` will be updated to contain `n` lists, each populated with integers from the user's input. 

Since `n` is given as an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cubes` will be a list with either 1, 2, or 3 sublists, depending on the value of `n`. The exact values in `cubes` depend on the user input.

Therefore, the output state after running the code would be as follows:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers from user input.**
