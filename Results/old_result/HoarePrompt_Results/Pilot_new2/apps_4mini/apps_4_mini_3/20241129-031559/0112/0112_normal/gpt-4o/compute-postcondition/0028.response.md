The value of `used_cubes[i]` is updated to `True`. The previous state indicates that `used_cubes[i]` was `False`, which means that the current cube at index `i` is now marked as used. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, `found` is False, `used_cubes` reflects the cubes that were used with `used_cubes[i]` as True, `i` is 0.**
