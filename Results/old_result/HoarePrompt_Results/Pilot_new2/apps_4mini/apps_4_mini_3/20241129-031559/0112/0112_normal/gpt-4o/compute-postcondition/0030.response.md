The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters; `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list; `found` is True; `used_cubes` reflects the cubes that were used; `used_cubes[i]` is True; `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
