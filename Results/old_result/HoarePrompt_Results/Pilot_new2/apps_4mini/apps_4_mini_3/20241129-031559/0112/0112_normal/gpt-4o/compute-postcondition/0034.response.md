The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`, and it was previously unspecified. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 2, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, `i` is 1, `used_cubes[1]` is set to True, and `found` is True.
