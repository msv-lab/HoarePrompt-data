Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the input range efficiently, particularly when the range of numbers is large (up to \(10^{18}\)). Specifically, the issue lies in the loop within `func_2`, where it iterates from `l` to `r` using `range(l, r + 1)`. This approach is not feasible for large values of `l` and `r`, as it could result in iterating through an extremely large number of integers, leading to performance issues or exceeding time limits.

For example, if we input:
```
1 1000000000000000000 2
```
The program will attempt to loop through all integers from 1 to \(10^{18}\), which is unmanageable and would likely take an impractical amount of time.

Additionally, while the function `func_1` correctly checks the number of distinct digits in a number against `k`, the overall logic to compute the sum remains inefficient for large input sizes.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for large ranges, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
