According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variables `l` and `r`. For the loop to execute, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`, which is already guaranteed by the states provided (1 ≤ l ≤ r). Since `l` is at least 1 and `r` is less than \(10^{18}\), this condition means the loop will execute for the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive.

At the start of the loop, the variable `num` will take the value of `l`, which is the first number in the range. The variable `total_sum` does not affect the execution of the loop but indicates the sum accumulated during the iterations.

Thus, the current state is sufficient for the loop to execute. We can conclude the necessary states as follows:

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`, `l` must be at least 1, `r` must be at least `l` and less than \(10^{18}\)**
