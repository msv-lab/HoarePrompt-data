To determine the correctness of the provided code based on the problem description, let's analyze the functions and their logic.

### Problem Description
The task is to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, and return this sum modulo `998244353`.

### Code Explanation
1. **Function `func_1(l, r, k)`**: 
   - Computes the sum of numbers in the range `[l, r]` by calculating the difference between two counts: 
     - `count(r, k)`: the count of numbers from `1` to `r` containing at most `k` different digits.
     - `count(l - 1, k)`: the count of numbers from `1` to `l-1` containing at most `k` different digits.
   - The result is taken modulo `MOD`.

2. **Function `count(n, k, dp)`**:
   - Returns the count of numbers from `1` to `n` that contain at most `k` different digits.
   - Uses memoization to optimize repeated calculations.
   - Handles the case where `k` is `0` by returning `0`, which is valid because if `k` is `0`, no number can meet the requirement.
   - Different cases are checked based on the value of `n` in relation to `10^k`.

### Validating the Code Against the Description
The functions seem to correctly implement the problem description by:
- Counting valid numbers up to `r`.
- Counting valid numbers up to `l-1`.
- Taking the difference to find the sum of valid numbers specifically in the range `[l, r]`.
- Considering the modulo operation as specified.

### Checking Edge Cases
1. **k = 0 Case**: The function immediately returns `0` for `k = 0`, which is a valid check; however, the problem statement specifies `1 â‰¤ k`, so this is not a concern in this case.
2. **Large Ranges**: Since `l` and `r` can be as large as `10^18`, the algorithm should efficiently compute counts without iterating through all numbers.

### Output Hints Validation
- The output hints correctly describe the functions. They mention that the `count` function computes based on memoization and considers the ranges adequately.
- It does not explicitly mention edge cases in the output hints, but the logic seems intact for the specified ranges and constraints.

### Conclusion
The code adheres to the problem description and handles possible edge cases appropriately. The output hints align with the logic presented in the code.

Thus, based on the analysis, the final determination is:

Correctness: **True**.
