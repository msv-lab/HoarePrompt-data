The expression updates `dp[n, k]` by adding a value calculated based on `i`, `k`, and powers of 10. The previous value of `dp[n, k]` is increased by `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged, while `i` is affected by being defined as the next integer after its current value.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 10, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)), `i` is updated to the next integer after its current value which is less than `k`.**
