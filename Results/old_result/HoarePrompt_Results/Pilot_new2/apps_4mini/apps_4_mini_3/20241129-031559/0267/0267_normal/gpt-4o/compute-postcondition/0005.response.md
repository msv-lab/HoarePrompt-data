According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `num`, `l`, and `r`. The loop iterates from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is `l`, which allows the loop to execute again if `num` can be increased, meaning `num` must be less than or equal to `r`.

Since `l` is at least 1 and `r` is at least `l`, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` will be incremented by 1. Therefore, at the next iteration, `num` will be `l + 1`. 

For the loop to execute again, the condition remains that `num` should be within the range defined by `l` and `r`. As `num` is now `l + 1`, it must still be less than or equal to `r`. Thus, we need to keep the condition that `r` is at least `l + 1`.

State: **`total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l + 1`, `l` is at least 1, `r` must be at least `l + 1`, and `r` is less than \(10^{18}\) if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true.**
