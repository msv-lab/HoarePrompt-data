The function accepts an integer `n` and an integer `k`, and returns True if the number of unique digits in the decimal representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it returns False. This assumes that `n` is a non-negative integer within the specified range, but does not handle cases where `n` is negative, which is outside the defined input constraints.
