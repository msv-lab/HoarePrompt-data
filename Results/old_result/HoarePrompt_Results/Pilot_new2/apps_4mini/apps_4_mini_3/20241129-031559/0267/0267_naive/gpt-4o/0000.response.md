To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program in detail.

### Problem Analysis
The task is to compute the sum of numbers from \( l \) to \( r \) (inclusive) such that each number contains at most \( k \) different digits, and then return this sum modulo \( 998244353 \).

### Program Analysis
1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - This function checks if the number \( n \) contains at most \( k \) different digits.
   - It converts the number to a string, creates a set of its characters, and checks the length of this set against \( k \).
   - This function works correctly for its intended purpose.

2. **Function `func_2(l, r, k)`**:
   - This function initializes a `total_sum` variable to 0.
   - It iterates over each number in the range from \( l \) to \( r \) (inclusive).
   - For each number, it calls `func_1` to check if the number has at most \( k \) different digits.
   - If it does, it adds the number to `total_sum` and ensures that the sum remains within the modulus \( 998244353 \).
   - The function returns the `total_sum`.

### Potential Issues
- The program's approach of iterating over every number between \( l \) and \( r \) is inefficient, especially given the constraints where \( r \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \). This could lead to performance issues, as directly iterating through potentially billions of integers is computationally impractical.
- The logic does not directly address any specific edge cases for very large ranges or values of \( k \).

### Test Cases
- For \( l = 10, r = 50, k = 2 \): The function should compute the sum of valid numbers and return \( 1230 \), which is correctly computed.
- For \( l = 1, r = 2345, k = 10 \): The function sums all numbers from \( 1 \) to \( 2345 \) and returns \( 2750685 \), which is also correct.
- For \( l = 101, r = 154, k = 2 \): The function computes the correct total of \( 2189 \).

### Conclusion
While the program produces correct results for the provided test cases, the potential performance issue and the lack of efficiency for very large ranges (which is a critical aspect given the constraints) indicate that the program does not adequately handle the problem as described. 

Because there is a feasible input that can cause the program to run inefficiently or fail to work within reasonable time limits (for example, \( l = 1, r = 10^{18}, k = 10 \)), the program is not robust against all inputs within the provided constraints.

Correctness: **False**.
