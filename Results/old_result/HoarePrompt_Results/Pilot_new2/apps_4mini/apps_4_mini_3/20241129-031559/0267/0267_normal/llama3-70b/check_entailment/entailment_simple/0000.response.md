To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly calculates the sum of integers from \( l \) to \( r \) that contain at most \( k \) different digits and returns this sum modulo \( 998244353 \).

### Analysis of the Program

1. **Functionality of `func_1(l, r, k)`**:
   - The function computes the difference between the count of valid numbers from \( 1 \) to \( r \) and \( 1 \) to \( l-1 \) using the `count` function. This is a correct way to determine the valid numbers in the range \( [l, r] \).
   - The result is then taken modulo \( 998244353 \).

2. **Functionality of `count(n, k, dp)`**:
   - This function is supposed to count how many numbers between \( 1 \) and \( n \) can be formed with at most \( k \) different digits.
   - If \( n < 10^k \), it simply returns \( n \), which means it counts all numbers up to \( n \). This is not correct because it allows numbers that may contain more than \( k \) different digits.
   - If \( n \geq 10^k \), it computes a value that involves several multiplications, but it does not guarantee that it is counting the correct numbers since it does not properly check the digits of each number to ensure they contain at most \( k \) different digits.

### Problematic Cases
- For example, if \( k = 2 \) and \( n = 112 \), the numbers \( 100, 101, 102, 110, 111, 112 \) all contain at most 2 different digits, but if the counting logic is flawed, it may miscount or miss valid numbers.
- The handling of numbers like \( 10, 11, 12, ... \) must correctly validate the digit composition, which the current implementation does not explicitly do.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the necessary checks to ensure only numbers with at most \( k \) different digits are counted. It incorrectly assumes that simply counting numbers up to \( n \) or using a mathematical formula gives the correct count, which is not guaranteed. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description under all scenarios.

Correctness: **False**
