Functionality: ** The function accepts three parameters: an integer `n`, an integer `k` (between 1 and 10 inclusive), and a dictionary `dp` for memoization. It returns 0 if `k` is 0. If `k` is not 0, it checks if the value for `(n, k)` is already cached in `dp` and returns it if found. If `n` is less than `10^k`, it sets `dp[n, k]` to `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to `10^k`, it calculates and updates `dp[n, k]` based on a formula that considers the contributions from previous computations, taking into account the modulo operation with `MOD`. The function ultimately returns the updated value of `dp[n, k]`. An edge case to note is that if `k` is 0, the function will not perform any additional calculations and will simply return 0.**
