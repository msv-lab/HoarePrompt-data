According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the range defined by `l` and `r`. The loop will iterate over `num` starting from `l` up to `r + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is `l + 1`, and given that `r` is at least `l + 1`, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be `l + 2`. 

We also know that `l` is at least 1 and `r` is at least `l + 1`, which means `r` must be at least 2. To allow another iteration, `num` must be less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `r` must be at least `l + 2`.

State: **`total_sum` is updated to `((l % MOD) + (l + 1)) % MOD`, `num` is `l + 2`, `l` is at least 1, `r` is at least `l + 2`, and `r` is less than \(10^{18}\) if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true.**
