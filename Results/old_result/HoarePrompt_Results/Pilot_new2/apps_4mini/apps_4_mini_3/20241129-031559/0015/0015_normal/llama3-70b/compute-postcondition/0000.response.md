The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new values based on the input provided, which are converted to integers. However, the previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified. Since the input can be any integer within the given range, the exact new values of `a`, `b`, and `c` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state will reflect that the variables have been updated without specifying the exact integers.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers within the range -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9**
