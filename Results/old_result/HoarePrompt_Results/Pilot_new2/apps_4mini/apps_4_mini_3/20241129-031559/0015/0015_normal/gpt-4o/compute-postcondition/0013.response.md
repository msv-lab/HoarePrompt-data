Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input. If `b` is equal to `a`, then the program does not perform any action. If `b` is not equal to `a` and `c` is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not equal to 0, then if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
