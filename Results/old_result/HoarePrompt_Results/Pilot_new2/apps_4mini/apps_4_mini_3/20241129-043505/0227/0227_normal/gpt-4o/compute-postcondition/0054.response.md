Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` includes `a[2]`, `assigned` must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, and `i` is 2. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
