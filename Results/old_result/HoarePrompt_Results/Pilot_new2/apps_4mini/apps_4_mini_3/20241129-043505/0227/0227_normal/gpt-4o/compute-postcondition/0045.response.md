The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` now includes `a[2]`, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` now includes `a[2]`, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is False.**
