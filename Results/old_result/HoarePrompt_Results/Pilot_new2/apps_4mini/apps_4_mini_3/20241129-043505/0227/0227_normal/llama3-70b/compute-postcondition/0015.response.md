The code snippet provided checks whether `m` is less than or equal to 23 and prints `m` if true; otherwise, it prints `-1`. 

Given the initial state, where `m` can be at most `n` and at least 1, the output depends on the value of `m`.

Output State: **If `m` is less than or equal to 23, then print `m`; otherwise, print `-1`. `m` is between 1 and `n`, inclusive.**
