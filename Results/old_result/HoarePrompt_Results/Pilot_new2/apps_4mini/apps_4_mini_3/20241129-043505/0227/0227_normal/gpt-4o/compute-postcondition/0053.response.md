The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State includes the unchanged values of the relevant variables and indicates the break action.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` includes `a[2]`, `assigned` must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
