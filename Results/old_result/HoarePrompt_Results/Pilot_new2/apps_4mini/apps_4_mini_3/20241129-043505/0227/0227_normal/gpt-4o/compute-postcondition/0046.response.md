To determine what needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the for loop statement.

1. The variable `assigned` must be a non-empty iterable for the for loop to execute. The current state does not provide information about the content of `assigned`, aside from the fact that it includes `a[2]`.

2. The ordered nature of `a` (as distinct integers sorted in ascending order) and the value of `n` (greater than 2) suggest that there are at least three elements in `a`. However, we do not know if `assigned` is empty or what other elements it might include.

3. The loop variable `x` will take on the values of the elements in `assigned`. Since `assigned` currently includes `a[2]`, it suggests that `assigned` must contain at least one element (which it does), but we do not know if there are additional elements.

Thus, the key points for the loop to execute are:
- `assigned` must not be empty, which is already satisfied since it includes `a[2]`.
- `i` is already set to 2, which is valid since it must correspond to an index in `a`.

Given this analysis, the states that need to be explicitly stated regarding the execution of the loop are:

State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` includes `a[2]`, `assigned` is not empty, `i` is 2**
