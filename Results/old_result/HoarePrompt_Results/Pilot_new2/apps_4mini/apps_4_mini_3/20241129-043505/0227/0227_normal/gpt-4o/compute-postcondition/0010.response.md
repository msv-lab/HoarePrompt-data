Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is `a[0]`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is an element of `assigned`, then `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
