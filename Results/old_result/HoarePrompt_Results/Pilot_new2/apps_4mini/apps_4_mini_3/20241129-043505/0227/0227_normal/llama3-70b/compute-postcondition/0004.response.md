According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is set to iterate from 1 to `n-1`, which means `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute at least once. Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, the current state of `n` being a positive integer would be valid for values of 2 to 23. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will begin at 1 for the first iteration. Since `m` is set to 1, it does not require any adjustments for the loop to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed at least once, we need:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2,
- `i` is 1 at the beginning of the first iteration.

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 1, `i` is 1**
