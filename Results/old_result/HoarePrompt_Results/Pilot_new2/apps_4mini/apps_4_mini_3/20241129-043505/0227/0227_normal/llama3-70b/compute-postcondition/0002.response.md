The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The value of `n` remains the same, as it only defines the size of the list. The elements of `a` are rearranged in non-decreasing order but retain their distinctiveness and values remain within the specified bounds. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers based on user input, where each integer satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9.**
