The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected, and they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` includes `a[2]`, `assigned` must have at least 3 elements, `x` is the third element in `assigned`, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is True.
