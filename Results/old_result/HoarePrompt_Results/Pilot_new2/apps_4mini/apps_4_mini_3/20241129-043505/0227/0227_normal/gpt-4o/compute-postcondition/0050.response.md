Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` includes `a[2]`, `assigned` is not empty, and `i` is 2. If the value of `a[2] - x` is an element of `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
