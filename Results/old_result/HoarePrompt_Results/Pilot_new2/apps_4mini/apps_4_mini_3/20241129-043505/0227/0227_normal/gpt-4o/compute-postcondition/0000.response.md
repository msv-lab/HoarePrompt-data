The list `a` will be sorted in ascending order. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it represents the number of elements in the list `a`, which is still a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23. The elements of `a` will be rearranged in sorted order, but since they are distinct integers within the range of 1 to 10^9, the specific values will be updated to reflect their sorted state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a list of n distinct integers sorted in ascending order.**
