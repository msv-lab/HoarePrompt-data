The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 23\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer \(a[k]\) satisfies \(1 \leq a[k] \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, it returns `m`, which is the count of unique integers in list `a` that cannot form pairs with previously assigned elements. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers `a`, and returns the count of unique integers in `a` that cannot form pairs with previously assigned elements.**
