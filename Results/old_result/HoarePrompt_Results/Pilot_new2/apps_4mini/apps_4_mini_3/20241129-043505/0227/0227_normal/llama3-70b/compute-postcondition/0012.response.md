The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The prior state indicates that `m` remains unchanged until the next comparison, meaning that it will now have a value that is one greater than its previous value. The values of `n`, `a`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `i` is 3, and `m` is incremented by 1.**
