Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from input values; `a`, `b` are distinct integers assigned from input values satisfying 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `a_floor` is equal to (a - 1) % m + 1, where 1 ≤ a_floor ≤ m; `a_block` is equal to (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is equal to (b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is equal to (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is equal to min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `min_floor_time` is equal to (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10, and `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`.**
