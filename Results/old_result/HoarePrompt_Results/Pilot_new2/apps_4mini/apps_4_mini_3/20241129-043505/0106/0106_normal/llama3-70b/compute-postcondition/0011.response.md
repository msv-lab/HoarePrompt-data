Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers. `a` and `b` are distinct integers satisfying 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is equal to (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. Otherwise, `min_floor_time` is equal to (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10, with `a_floor` being less than or equal to `b_floor`. In both cases, `min_block_time` is equal to min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15.***
