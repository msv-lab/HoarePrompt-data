The variable `floor` is assigned the value of `floor_within_block // k + 1`. The value of `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`, which gives a specific remainder when `apartment - 1` is divided by `m * k`. Since `k` is a positive integer, the division `floor_within_block // k` results in an integer quotient. The addition of 1 means that `floor` represents the floor number within that block.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `floor_within_block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`; `floor` is equal to `floor_within_block // k + 1`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `floor_within_block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`; `floor` is equal to `floor_within_block // k + 1`.**
