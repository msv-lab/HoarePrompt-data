To verify the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the logic step by step to see if it adheres to the problem description and handles all potential cases.

### Breakdown of the Code:

1. **Input Parsing**:
   - The program reads three integers \( n, m, k \) that represent the number of blocks, floors per block, and apartments per floor, respectively.
   - It reads two integers \( a \) and \( b \) representing the apartments where Edward and Natasha live.

2. **Calculating Floors and Blocks**:
   - The code calculates which floor and block Edward and Natasha are in:
     ```python
     a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
     a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
     b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     ```
   - Here, it correctly determines the floor and the block based on the apartment number.

3. **Time Calculation**:
   - The program computes the time to travel between blocks. It considers both clockwise and counterclockwise directions:
     ```python
     min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
     ```
   - This part calculates the time taken to move between blocks correctly.

4. **Floor Transition Time**:
   - The program calculates the time to transition floors. It includes waiting time for the elevator:
     ```python
     if a_floor > b_floor:
         min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10
     else:
         min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
     ```
   - This section appears to incorrectly handle the elevator time. If Edward is on a higher floor than Natasha, the elevator time should reflect the time taken to get down not just the vertical movement time. 

### Potential Issues:

1. **Incorrect Floor Transition Time Calculation**:
   - The elevator wait time is added regardless of whether Edward is going up or down. In the case of moving from a lower floor to a higher floor, it should be just the time to travel plus the 10 seconds wait, but here it doesn't account for the elevator being called in the upward direction correctly.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - The program does not handle cases where Edward or Natasha's apartment might be on the lowest or the highest floor correctly in terms of elevator logic, particularly when it comes to the first floor.

3. **Ignoring Instantaneous Movement**:
   - The program does not account for the fact that if Edward is on the same floor as Natasha, he can instantly move to her apartment without any time incurred.

### Conclusion:

Given these findings, the program does not correctly compute the travel time considering all possible scenarios and edge cases, particularly the elevator logic. 

Therefore, the final verdict on the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False** 

### Example of Failure:
- Consider \( n = 4, m = 10, k = 5, a = 1, b = 6 \). Edward is on the first floor of the first block and Natasha is on the first floor of the second block. The program does not account for the instantaneous movement to her apartment on the same floor, resulting in a miscalculation of the time taken.
