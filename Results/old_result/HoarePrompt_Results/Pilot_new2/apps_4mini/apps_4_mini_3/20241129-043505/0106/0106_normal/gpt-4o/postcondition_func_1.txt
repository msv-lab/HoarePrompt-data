The function accepts a positive integer `apartment`, calculates the corresponding block number and floor number within a multi-block structure defined by parameters `m` and `k`, and returns these two values. It does not check if the `apartment` number is valid within the range defined by `1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k`, potentially leading to incorrect results if an invalid apartment number is provided.
