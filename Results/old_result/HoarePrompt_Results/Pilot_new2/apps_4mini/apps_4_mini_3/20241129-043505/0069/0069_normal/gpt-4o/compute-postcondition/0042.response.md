The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. Given that `index` is 5, this means `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[6])`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 5, `balance` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `results` is either a list containing -1 or [0] or a list with the value of `count`, `n` is equal to `int(data[5])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 5, `balance` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `results` is either a list containing -1 or [0] or a list with the value of `count`, `n` is equal to `int(data[5])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`.**
