Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, `count` is 1. If the current value of `x` and `b` satisfy that the difference `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and the quotient `(x - b) // balance` is greater than or equal to 0, then the count is updated to 1. Otherwise, the values of `T`, `index`, `results`, `n`, `prefix_balances`, and `count` remain unchanged.***
