To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze the program step-by-step and check whether it fulfills the requirements set forth.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. We need to calculate the number of prefixes of an infinite string `t` that have a certain balance `x`.
2. The balance for any string is defined as the count of '0's minus the count of '1's.
3. The string `t` is formed by infinitely concatenating the string `s`.
4. The output must be either the number of such prefixes or `-1` if there are infinitely many.

### Key Points to Check in the Program:
1. **Reading Input:** The program correctly reads multiple test cases with the input format specified in the problem.
2. **Calculating Balance:** The balance of the string `s` is computed correctly using `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`.
3. **Prefix Balances:** The program maintains a list of prefix balances, which is accurate as it calculates cumulative balances for all prefixes of `s`.
4. **Handling Zero Balance:** 
   - If the overall balance of `s` is zero, the program checks if the desired balance `x` exists in the array of prefix balances. This is valid because if the balance is zero, the only way to reach new balances is through prefixes that repeat.
   - If `x` is found in the prefix balances, it correctly outputs `-1` (infinite solutions).
   - If not found, it correctly outputs `0` (no valid prefixes).
5. **Handling Non-zero Balance:**
   - If the balance is non-zero, the program iterates through the prefix balances to check how many valid prefixes can be formed to reach the desired balance `x`.
   - It correctly uses the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` to ensure that the balance can be achieved through a valid number of repetitions of `s`.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. It checks for all necessary conditions, manages input correctly, and computes the required outputs based on the balance and the prefixes of the string `s`.

### Final Assessment:
Since the program adheres to the problem description and effectively handles all edge cases outlined, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
