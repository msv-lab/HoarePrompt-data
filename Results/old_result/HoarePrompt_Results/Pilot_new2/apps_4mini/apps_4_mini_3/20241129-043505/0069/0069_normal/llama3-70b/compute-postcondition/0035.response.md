Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, for each test case `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `x` is an integer between -10^9 and 10^9, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. After all iterations, for each test case, either `n + 1` has been printed if `balance` equals `x`, `-1` has been printed if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, or `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` has been printed otherwise.**
