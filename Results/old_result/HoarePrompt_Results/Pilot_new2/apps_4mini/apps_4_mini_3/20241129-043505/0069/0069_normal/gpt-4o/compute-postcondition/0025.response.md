Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer extracted from `data[1]`, `x` is int(data[2]), `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, and `balance` is not equal to 0. `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` for `i` in `1` to `n` is equal to the cumulative sum of `1` for '0's and `-1` for '1's in the substring `s[0:i-1]`.***
