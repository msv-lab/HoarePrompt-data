Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 8, and `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, which is currently 0. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` is now a list containing -1. Otherwise, `results` now contains 0 in addition to its previous values. `n` is a non-negative integer, `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `s` is equal to `data[7]`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` with `prefix_balances[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` containing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and if `n` is 0, then `prefix_balances` is a list with one element being 0.***
