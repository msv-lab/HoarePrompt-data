Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, `count` is 0. The current value of `x` and `b` satisfies that the difference `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance`, and the quotient `(x - b) // balance` is greater than or equal to 0.***
