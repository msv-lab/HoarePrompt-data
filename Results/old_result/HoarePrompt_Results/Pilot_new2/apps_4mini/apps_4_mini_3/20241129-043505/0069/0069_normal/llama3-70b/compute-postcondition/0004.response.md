`cnt0` is assigned the value of the count of '0's in the binary string `s`, while `cnt1` is assigned the value of the count of '1's in the same string. The values of `T`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged, but `cnt0` and `cnt1` are now defined based on the content of `s`. Since `s` is a binary string, its length `n` indicates that `cnt0 + cnt1` must equal `n`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `x` is an integer between -10^9 and 10^9, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`.**
