Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `x` is an integer between -10^9 and 10^9, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the value `n + 1` has been printed. Otherwise, if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the program proceeds without modification. If not, the output of the print statement is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.***
