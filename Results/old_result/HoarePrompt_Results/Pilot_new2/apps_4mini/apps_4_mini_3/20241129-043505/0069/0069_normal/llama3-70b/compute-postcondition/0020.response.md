The code `print(n + 1)` outputs the value of `n + 1`. The value of `n` is an input positive integer between 1 and 100000, and it remains unchanged after execution. Other variables are not affected by this line of code, and the only effect is the output of `n + 1`. 

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `n` is an input positive integer between 1 and 100000, `x` is an input integer between -10^9 and 10^9, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is equal to the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is equal to the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. The value `n + 1` has been printed.**
