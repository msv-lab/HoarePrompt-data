The variable `x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`. The previous state does not specify what `data` contains, but it indicates that `index` can be either 8 or `n + 8`. Since `n` is equal to `int(data[index])`, the value of `index + 1` could be either 9 or `n + 9`. The output state remains dependent on the condition that `index` is determined by the value of `balance`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is either 8 or `n + 8`, `results` is now a list that must still meet the conditions imposed by the last iteration, `n` is now equal to `int(data[index])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is equal to `data[7]`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`.**
