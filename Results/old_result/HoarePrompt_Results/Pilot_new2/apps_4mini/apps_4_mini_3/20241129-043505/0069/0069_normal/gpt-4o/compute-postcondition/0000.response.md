Output State: **`T` is an integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; for each test case, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5 and `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9; `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting only of characters '0' and '1'; `input` is assigned the value of `sys.stdin.read()`, capturing all input data as a single string.**
