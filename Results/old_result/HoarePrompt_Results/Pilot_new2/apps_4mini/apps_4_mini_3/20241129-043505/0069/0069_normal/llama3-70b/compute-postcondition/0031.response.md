The code `print(-1)` does not change any variable values; it only outputs `-1`. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 99, `n` is an input positive integer between 1 and 100000, `x` is an input integer between -10^9 and 10^9, `s` is the binary string input, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, and `-1` is printed.**
