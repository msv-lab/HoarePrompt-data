The variable `T` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The conditions regarding `T`, `n`, `x`, and `s` remain valid as they were defined in the initial state. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `T` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9, and `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'. 

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `T` <= 100; for each test case, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 10^5, `x` is an integer such that -10^9 <= `x` <= 10^9, and `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'; `T` is assigned the value of `int(input())`.**
