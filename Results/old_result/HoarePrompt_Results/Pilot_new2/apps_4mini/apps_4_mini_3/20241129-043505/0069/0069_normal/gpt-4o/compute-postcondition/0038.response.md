The code `results.append(count)` adds the current value of `count` to the `results` list. The initial state specifies that `results` is an empty list, and `count` represents the total number of valid updates. After this operation, `results` will contain the value of `count` as its first element. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 4 plus the number of successful iterations of the loop, `results` is a list with the value of `count`, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, `count` is the total number of valid updates where `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`.**
