Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is either 4 or 4 plus the number of successful iterations of the loop. If `balance` is equal to 0, `results` is either a list containing -1 (if `x` is present in `prefix_balances`) or a list containing [0] (if `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`). If `balance` is not equal to 0, `results` is a list with the value of `count`, where `count` is the total number of valid updates such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. `n` is an integer extracted from `data[1]` which is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is int(data[2]), `s` is equal to `data[3]`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`, where `prefix_balances[i]` for `i` in `1` to `n` is equal to the cumulative sum of `1` for '0's and `-1` for '1's in the substring `s[0:i-1]`.***
