The value of `index` is incremented by 3. Since the initial value of `index` is 5, the new value of `index` becomes 8. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 8, `balance` is either 0 or not equal to 0, `results` is either a list containing -1 or [0] or a list with the value of `count`, `n` is equal to `int(data[5])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `s` is equal to `data[7]`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`.**
