Postcondition: ***`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 9, `balance` is not equal to 0, `results` is either a list containing -1 or [0] or a list with the value of `count`, `n` is a non-negative integer that must be at least 8, `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `s` is equal to `data[7]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` with `prefix_balances[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` containing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, `b` is the 9th element of `prefix_balances`, and if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1.***
