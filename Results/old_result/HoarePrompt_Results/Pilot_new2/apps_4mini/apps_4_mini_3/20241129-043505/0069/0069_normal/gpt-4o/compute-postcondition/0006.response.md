In the given code snippet, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data` is presumably a list or array from which the value at the current `index` is extracted and converted to an integer. The initial state indicates that `index` is currently 1, and `results` remains unchanged from being an empty list. The value of `T` is not directly manipulated in this code. 

Given that `data` is not defined in this context, the specific value of `n` will depend on the contents of `data` at the position `index`. However, we can state that `n` will capture whatever integer value is contained in `data[1]`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer extracted from `data[1]**.
