The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` could be either 8 or `n + 8`, and after the increment, it will be either 11 or `n + 11`. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is either 11 or `n + 11`, `results` is still a list that meets the conditions imposed by the last iteration, `n` is equal to `int(data[index])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is either 11 or `n + 11`, `results` is a list that must still meet the conditions imposed by the last iteration, `n` is equal to `int(data[index])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is equal to `data[index + 2]`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1`.**
