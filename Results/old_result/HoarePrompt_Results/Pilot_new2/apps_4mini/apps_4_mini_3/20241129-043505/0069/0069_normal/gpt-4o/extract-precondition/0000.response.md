Precondition: **T is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 100; for each test case, n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and x is an integer such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9; s is a binary string of length n consisting only of characters '0' and '1'. The total length of all strings s across test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
