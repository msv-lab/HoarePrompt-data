The code snippet `results.append(0)` appends the value `0` to the list `results`. The other variables remain unchanged. The state of `results` will now include `0`, but since the initial state allows for `results` to be a list containing -1, [0], or a list with the value of `count`, we cannot determine the exact final contents without knowing the initial contents of `results`. However, we can confirm that `0` has been added.

Output State: **`T` is an integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 8, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `results` now contains 0 in addition to its previous values, `n` is a non-negative integer, `x` is equal to `int(data[6])`, `s` is equal to `data[7]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of size `n + 1` with `prefix_balances[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` containing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`, where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, and if `n` is 0, then `prefix_balances` is a list with one element being 0.**
