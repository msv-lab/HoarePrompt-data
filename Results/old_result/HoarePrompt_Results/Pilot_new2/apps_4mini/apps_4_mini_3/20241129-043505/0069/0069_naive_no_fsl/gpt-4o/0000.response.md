To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic step by step and consider potential edge cases.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We need to calculate the number of prefixes of an infinite string `t`, constructed by repeating a binary string `s`, that have a balance equal to `x`. 
   - The balance is defined as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the prefixes.

2. **Analyzing the Program**:
   - The program first calculates the overall balance of string `s` by counting '0's and '1's.
   - It constructs a list of prefix balances for the string `s`.
   - It checks if the balance of `s` is zero:
     - If zero, it checks if `x` is in the prefix balances. If so, it returns `-1` indicating infinite prefixes. If not, it returns `0`.
   - If the balance is not zero, it counts how many valid prefixes can be formed such that the balance equals `x`.

3. **Potential Issue**:
   - The program checks if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` which determines if a specific `b` from prefix balances can form the required balance `x` after some repetitions of `s`. 
   - However, the condition `(x - b) // balance >= 0` requires careful consideration, particularly when `balance` could be negative. This could lead to incorrect counts if not properly handled.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the case where `s = "11"` and `x = 0`. Here, the balance of `s` is `-2`. 
     - According to the logic, `prefix_balances` would be `[0, -1, -2]`.
     - The program would check if `(0 - (-1)) % (-2) == 0`, which is true, but the count would be incorrect since the balance won't reach zero in repetition despite the prefixes indicating potential matching.
   - The program does not consider the situation when `s` has all '1's (or all '0's), which could lead to a misunderstanding of the infinite conditions.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly handle cases where the balance is negative or where the string consists solely of '1's or '0's. It may yield incorrect counts due to improper handling of the conditions for infinite prefixes and counts.

Thus, the program is deemed incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
