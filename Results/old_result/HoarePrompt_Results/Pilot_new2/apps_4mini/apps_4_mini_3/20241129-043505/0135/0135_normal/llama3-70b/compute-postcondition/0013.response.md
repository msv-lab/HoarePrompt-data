Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` is a set that includes the value of `remainder` and 0, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is `n % 2`. If `remainder` is in `seen`, 'No' is printed, and the program exits. If `remainder` is not in `seen`, the program continues executing without any output or termination.***
