The code `print('No')` outputs the string 'No' to the console. It does not modify any variable states or values; it only results in an action that outputs text. Therefore, the values of all the affected variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an input integer between 1 and 10^18, `seen` is a set that includes the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0; 'No' has been printed.**
