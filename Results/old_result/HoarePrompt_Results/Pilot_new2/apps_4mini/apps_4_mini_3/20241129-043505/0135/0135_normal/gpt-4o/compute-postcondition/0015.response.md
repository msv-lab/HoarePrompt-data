According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. Since `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k < n`, `k` must be at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to increase by 1, making `i` equal to 3.

To determine if the loop can execute again, we also consider the relation of `i` to `k`. As long as `k` is at least 3, the loop will execute again. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `k` < `n`, `i` is 3, and `seen_remainders` includes the value of `remainder` (which is `n % 2`).**
