The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers within the range of 1 to 10^18. 

Based on the execution of the function:
- **Case 1**: If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'.
- **Case 2**: If the current value of 'remainder' is already in 'seen_remainders', the function returns 'No'.
- **Case 3**: The function returns 'No'.
- **Case 4**: The function returns 'No'.
- **Case 5**: If all conditions are met and the loop executes `k` times without repetition, the function returns 'Yes', indicating that all remainders from the division of `n` by `i`, for `i` in the range from 1 to `k`, were unique.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return 'No' under several conditions related to the values of `n` and `k`, or return 'Yes' if all remainders from the division of `n` by integers from 1 to `k` are unique. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, and returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, if the current remainder is already seen, or under other specific conditions; otherwise, it returns 'Yes' if all remainders from the division of `n` by integers from 1 to `k` are unique.**
