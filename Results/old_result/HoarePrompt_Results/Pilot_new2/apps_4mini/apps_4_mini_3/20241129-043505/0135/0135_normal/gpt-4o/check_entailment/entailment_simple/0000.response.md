Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases described in the problem. While it correctly checks for distinct remainders when `k < n`, it fails in cases where `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. 

The logic in the program states that if `k >= n`, it immediately returns 'No'. However, this is incorrect because when `k` is equal to `n`, the remainders for `i = n` and `i = 1` will both yield a remainder of 0 (as `n % n` equals 0 and `n % 1` also equals 0). Thus, the program should have returned 'Yes' only if all of the remainders from `1` to `k` are distinct, which is not guaranteed by simply checking if `k` is less than `n`.

For example, consider the input `n = 4` and `k = 4`. The remainders would be:
- `4 % 1 = 0`
- `4 % 2 = 0`
- `4 % 3 = 1`
- `4 % 4 = 0`

Here, we can see that the remainders are not distinct since 0 appears multiple times, which should lead to a 'No' answer, but the program does not check this correctly because of its early return for `k >= n`.

Therefore, the program fails to cover all required cases as described in the problem statement.
