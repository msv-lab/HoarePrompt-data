`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`. Given that `i` is 2, `remainder` will be equal to `n % 2`, which indicates whether `n` is even or odd. The value of `remainder` will be 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd. The values of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` < `n`; `i` is 2; `seen_remainders` now contains `remainder`; `remainder` is `n % 2` (which is 0 if `n` is even, 1 if `n` is odd).

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` < `n`; `i` is 2; `seen_remainders` now contains `remainder`; `remainder` is `n % 2`.**
