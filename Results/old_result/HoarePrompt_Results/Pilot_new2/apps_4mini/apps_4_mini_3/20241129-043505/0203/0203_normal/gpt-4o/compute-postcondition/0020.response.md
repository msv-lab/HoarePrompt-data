The variable `d_index` is assigned the value of `d_queue.pop(0)`, which removes and returns the first element from the `d_queue`. This implies that `d_queue` will have one less element after this operation. The values of `n`, `r_queue`, and the remaining elements in `d_queue` are not directly affected by this code. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `d_queue` now has one less index; `r_queue` must contain at least one index; `d_index` is the first index that was removed from `d_queue`.**
