The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The string representing the employees, which consists of 'D' and 'R', is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is `n` is now a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and the string of length `n` remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and the string of length `n` consists only of the characters 'D' and 'R'**.
