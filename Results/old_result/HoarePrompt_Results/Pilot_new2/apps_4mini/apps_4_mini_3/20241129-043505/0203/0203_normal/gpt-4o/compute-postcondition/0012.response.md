The code `r_queue.append(i)` adds the current index `i` to the `r_queue` list. The initial state indicates that `n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, and `i` is the next index, which means `i` has a specific value that is incremented by 1. The value of `v`, being the next vote in `votes`, is not directly affected by this code. 

Since `r_queue` is a data structure that is being modified by appending the value of `i`, its state now includes the new index `i`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `v` remain as they were before the code execution, with the specific change being the addition of `i` to `r_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is the next index; `v` is the next vote in `votes`; `r_queue` now includes the value `i`.**
