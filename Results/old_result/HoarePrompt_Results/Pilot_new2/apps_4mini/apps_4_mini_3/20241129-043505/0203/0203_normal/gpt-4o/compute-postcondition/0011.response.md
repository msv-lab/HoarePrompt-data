The code `d_queue.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. The variable `d_queue` is not mentioned in the initial state, so we can assume it is defined elsewhere in the program. The existing values of `n`, `i`, and `v` are unaffected by this operation. 

Since `i` is described as the next index, its value is incremented by 1, but we don't know its current value, so we refer to it as `i`. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `i` is the next index (which is `i + 1`); `v` is the next vote in `votes`; `d_queue` now includes the current value of `i`**.
