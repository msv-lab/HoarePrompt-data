According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. The loop will execute for each character in the `fractions` string, which has a length of `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `fraction` is the second character in the string, meaning the loop has already processed the first character. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, it must move to the third character in the string. 

Since the string has a length of `n + 1`, for the loop to execute again, the length must at least be 3 (which corresponds to `n` being at least 2). The next character, `fraction`, will be the third character in the string.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n + 1`, fraction is the third character in the string.**
