The code initializes `d_queue` as an empty list. The variables `n` and `votes` remain unchanged as the initialization does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list.**
