The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, but it utilizes two implicit inputs: `n`, which is a positive integer representing the number of employees, and a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'D' and 'R'. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. 

However, based on the context, we can infer the functionality. The function is likely designed to process the string of characters representing the employees' affiliations (either 'D' for depublicans or 'R' for remocrats) in some manner related to the count or distribution of these affiliations.

Since the specific output is not described, we will summarize the known inputs without making assumptions about the return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts an implicit positive integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) representing the number of employees and a string of length n consisting only of the characters 'D' and 'R'. The output details are not specified.**
