To determine the output state after all iterations of the loop have executed, we analyze the loop's code and the conditions that dictate the values of the variables involved. The loop iterates over each character in the `fractions` string, contributing to the counts of `depublicans` and `remocrats` based on whether the character is 'D' or 'R'.

Given the loop structure and the initial state:

Initial State: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length `n` consisting only of the characters 'D' and 'R', `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0.

The loop will iterate exactly `n` times, processing each character in `fractions`. 

After all iterations of the loop have completed:
- `depublicans` will equal the total number of 'D' characters in `fractions`.
- `remocrats` will equal the total number of 'R' characters in `fractions`.

Since the string is of length `n` and consists only of 'D' and 'R', the sum of `depublicans` and `remocrats` must equal `n`.

Output State: **`depublicans` is the count of 'D' in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' in `fractions`, and `depublicans` + `remocrats` equals `n`.**
