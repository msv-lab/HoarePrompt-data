The function `func` accepts two parameters: an integer `n`, which is constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\), and a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', where 'D' represents a depublican and 'R' represents a remocrat. After executing the function body, the function processes these inputs and returns a specific output based on the characters in the string. 

The details of the output are not specified, but it will depend on the input characters. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept an integer `n` and a string of length `n` containing 'D' and 'R', and return a result based on the processing of these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and returns a result based on the processing of these inputs.**
