The value of `d_index` is added to `n`, and the result is appended to `d_queue`. The previous values of `d_queue`, `n`, and `d_index` impact the output state, specifically `d_queue` will now have an additional element. The other values remain unchanged, but we can state the updated value in the output. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `d_queue` now has one more index which is equal to `d_index + n`; `r_queue` has one less index than before; `r_index` is the value of the first element of `r_queue` before the pop operation; the current value of `d_index` is less than `r_index`.**
