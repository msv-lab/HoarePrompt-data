To verify whether the provided program correctly determines if a string is "s-palindrome" based on the given problem description, we need to carefully analyze the code and check for potential edge cases.

The function `func_1(s)` checks whether the string `s` is symmetric about its middle by comparing characters from the beginning and the end moving towards the center. However, the problem description specifies that a string is an "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric when considering the mirror reflection of characters. This means that certain pairs of characters must match when viewed in a mirror.

For example:
- The character 'X' reflects to 'X'.
- The character 'o' reflects to 'o'.
- However, the character 'a' does not reflect to itself; instead, it reflects to 'É’', which is not an English letter in this context.

In the provided code:
- It only checks if characters at symmetric positions are equal, which does not account for the mirror reflection concept described.

Let's test a specific case for clarity:
1. The input "oXxo" would be considered an "s-palindrome" based on mirror reflections. The characters 'o' and 'o' match, and 'X' reflects to 'X'. The middle characters also mirror correctly.

However, if we change this to "oAxo", the function will incorrectly return "TAK" because 'o' is compared with 'o', 'A' with 'A', but the 'A' should reflect to a different character, which the function does not account for.

Due to this oversight in the logic, we can conclude that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem as specified.

Correctness: **False**
