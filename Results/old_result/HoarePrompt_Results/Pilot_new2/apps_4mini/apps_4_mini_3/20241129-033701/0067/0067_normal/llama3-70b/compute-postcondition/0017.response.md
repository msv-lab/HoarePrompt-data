Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, the output is '+'. If `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and `x` is less than `y`, the output is processed under that condition. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, when `x` equals `y`, if `z` is equal to 0, then `x` is also 0; if `z` is greater than 0, then `z` remains greater than 0. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is '?'.***
