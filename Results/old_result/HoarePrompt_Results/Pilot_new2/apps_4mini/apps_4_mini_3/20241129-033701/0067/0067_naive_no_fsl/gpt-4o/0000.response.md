Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the number of upvotes and downvotes are equal when there are unknown votes (`z`). For example, with input `0 0 1`, the output should be `?` since the unknown voter could either upvote (resulting in +1 upvote) or downvote (resulting in -1 downvote), leading to two different outcomes. However, the program does not correctly handle this situation and will print `?`, which is correct, but it also incorrectly handles cases where the input is `1 1 0`, where it outputs `0` instead of `?`. 

Let's detail a specific problematic case to illustrate the issue:
- For the input `1 1 1`: 
    - The unknown voter could either upvote or downvote, which means the results could either be `2` (upvote) or `0` (downvote), leading to two potential outcomes: `+` and `-`. 
    - The program will determine `max_upvotes` as `2` and `max_downvotes` as `2`, resulting in an output of `?`, which is correct.
    
However, if we consider the input `1 1 0`:
- Here, the upvotes and downvotes are equal, leading to a conclusive result of `0`, which the program correctly identifies.

However, the program does not account for the different scenarios that could arise from the unknown votes (`z`), hence it fails to consistently apply the logic required by the problem statement. The handling of `0` upvotes and `0` downvotes with unknowns is also a critical test case that the program does not interpret correctly. Thus, it misses the definitive nuances required by the problem statement throughout its logic.

In conclusion, since there are cases where the output can be inconsistent with the description, the program is incorrect.
