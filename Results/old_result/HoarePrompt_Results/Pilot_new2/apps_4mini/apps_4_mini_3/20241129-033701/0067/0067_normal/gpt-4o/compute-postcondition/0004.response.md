The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The values of `y` and `z` are constrained to be between 0 and 100, so `max_downvotes` will range from 0 (when both `y` and `z` are 0) to 200 (when both `y` and `z` are at their maximum of 100). The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer from input; `y` is an integer between 0 and 100; `z` is an integer between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.

Output State: **`x` is an integer from input; `y` is an integer between 0 and 100; `z` is an integer between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.**
