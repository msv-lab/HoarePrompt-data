Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is equal to 0, `x` is also 0; if `z` is greater than 0, `z` is greater than 0. If `x` is not equal to `y`, the output is '?'***
