The code `print('0')` outputs the string '0', but does not change the values of any variables. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain the same as stated in the initial conditions. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, the current value of `x` is equal to `y`, and the current value of `z` is equal to 0.**
