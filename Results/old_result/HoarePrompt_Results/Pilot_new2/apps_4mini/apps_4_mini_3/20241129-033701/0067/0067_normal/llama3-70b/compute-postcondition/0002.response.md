The code `print('+')` does not change the values of any variables but simply outputs the character '+'. The initial state states that `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x > y + z`), and this condition remains valid.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, the current value of `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z` (i.e., `x > y + z`), and the output is '+'**.
