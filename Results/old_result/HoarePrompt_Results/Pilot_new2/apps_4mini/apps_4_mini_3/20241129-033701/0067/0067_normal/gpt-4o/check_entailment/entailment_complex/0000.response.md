The given program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description. Below is the breakdown of how it meets the requirements:

1. **Inputs**: It reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input, which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes, respectively. This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Calculating Votes**:
   - `min_upvotes` is correctly set to `x`, since the minimum number of upvotes is exactly the number of known upvotes.
   - `max_upvotes` is correctly calculated as `x + z`, which represents the scenario where all unknown votes are upvotes.
   - Similarly, `min_downvotes` is set to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is set to `y + z`.

3. **Decision Logic**:
   - The first condition checks if `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`. If this condition is true, it indicates that even in the most favorable scenario for upvotes, they are still outnumbered by the downvotes. Thus, it correctly prints `'-'`.
   - The second condition checks if `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`. If this condition is true, it means that even in the most favorable scenario for downvotes, downvotes cannot match the minimum upvotes. Therefore, it correctly prints `'+'`.
   - If neither condition is satisfied, it indicates that there can be situations where the votes can balance out or lead to uncertainty. Hence, it prints `'?'`.

4. **Output**: The program correctly outputs either `'-'`, `'+'`, or `'?'`, which matches the required outputs in the problem description.

All scenarios outlined in the problem description are covered by the program's logic:
- In cases where there are definite winners (`+` or `-`), it provides the correct output.
- In cases where the outcome is uncertain (due to the unknown votes), it also returns `'?'`.

Therefore, the program correctly adheres to the problem requirements for all potential inputs in the specified range.

Correctness: **True**
