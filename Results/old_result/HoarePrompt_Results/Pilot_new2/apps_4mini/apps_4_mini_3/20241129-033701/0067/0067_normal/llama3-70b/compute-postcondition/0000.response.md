The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values obtained from `input().split()`, converted to integers. Since the exact input values are not provided, but we know that `x`, `y`, and `z` must remain integers within the range of 0 to 100, the output state reflects this. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, with `x`, `y`, `z` assigned new integer values from input.**
