The code snippet simply prints the character `'-'` to the output. It does not modify any variables or change any values. The conditions regarding the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` still hold true. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. The current value of `x` is less than `y`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. The current value of `x` is less than `y`.**
