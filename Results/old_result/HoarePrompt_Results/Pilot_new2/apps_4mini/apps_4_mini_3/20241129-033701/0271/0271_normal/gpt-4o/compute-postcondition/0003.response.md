The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. Given that `remainder` is defined as `n % 10`, it represents the last digit of `n`. Since `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, the value of `result` will be `n - (n % 10)`. This means `result` will be `n` adjusted down to the nearest multiple of 10. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is equal to `n % 10`, and the current value of `remainder` is less than or equal to 5; `result` is equal to `n - (n % 10)`.**
