Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n` is a multiple of 10, `n` is printed. If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, the result is the largest multiple of 10 less than `n`. If `n % 10` is greater than 5, the result is the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`.***
