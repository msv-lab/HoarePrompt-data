The program appears to correctly implement the rounding logic described in the problem statement. Let's break down how it aligns with the requirements:

1. **Input Validation**: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, ensuring that `0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9`, which matches the input constraints given in the problem description.

2. **Rounding Logic**:
   - The program computes the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 (`remainder = n % 10`).
   - If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the program rounds `n` down to the nearest lower multiple of ten by subtracting the remainder (`result = n - remainder`).
   - If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds `n` up to the nearest higher multiple of ten (`result = n + (10 - remainder)`).

3. **Correctness of Rounding**:
   - For any integer `n`, if the last digit (the remainder when divided by 10) is 0, 1, 2, 3, 4, or 5, the program correctly rounds down to the nearest ten.
   - If the last digit is 6, 7, 8, or 9, the program correctly rounds up to the nearest ten.
   - Thus, for any input value of `n`, the function will produce a valid output that meets the rounding requirements outlined in the problem description.

4. **Output**: The function prints the result, which corresponds to the requirement of outputting the rounded integer.

Given the above analysis, the program correctly aligns with the problem description for all possible cases, including edge cases like `n = 0` or `n = 10^9`.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**
