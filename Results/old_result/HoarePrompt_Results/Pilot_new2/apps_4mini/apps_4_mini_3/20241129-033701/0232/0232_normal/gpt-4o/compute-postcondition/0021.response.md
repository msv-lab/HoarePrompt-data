Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `right` is 0, `left` is the original value of `left` plus the total number of times the loop executed, `current_counts[color]` for each `color` in `desired_counts` is equal to `desired_counts[color]`, and the loop must have executed until at least one `current_counts[color]` became less than `desired_counts[color]`, thus breaking the loop.**
