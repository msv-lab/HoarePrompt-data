Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `right` is 2; `left` is the original value of `left` plus 2; `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1; `desired_counts[colors[left]]` must be less than or equal to the current value of `current_counts[colors[left]]` after decrement. If all color counts match their desired counts, the program returns 'YES', indicating the counts have been satisfied.***
