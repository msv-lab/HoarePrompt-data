The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` is not specified but it is assumed to be the original value plus 1, so the new value of `left` becomes the original value plus 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `right` is 2; `left` is the original value of `left` plus 2; `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2; `right` is 2; `left` is the original value of `left` plus 2; `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1.**
