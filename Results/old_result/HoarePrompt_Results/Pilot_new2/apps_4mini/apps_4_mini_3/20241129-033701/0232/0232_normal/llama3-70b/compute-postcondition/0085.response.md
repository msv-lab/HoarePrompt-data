According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates from `i` to `n - 1`. Given that `i` is 2 and `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 1, it must be at least 2, and since `i` is 2, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 2. 

For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 2. The variable `j` will start from the value of `i`, which is 2.

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2**
