Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) greater than 1; `right` is 1; `left` is the original value of `left` plus the total number of times the loop executed plus 1; at least one `current_counts[color]` is adjusted to be greater than or equal to `desired_counts[color]` for some `color` in `desired_counts`; `current_counts[colors[left]]` is adjusted back to at least `desired_counts[colors[left]]`. If all `current_counts[color]` match `desired_counts[color]`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
