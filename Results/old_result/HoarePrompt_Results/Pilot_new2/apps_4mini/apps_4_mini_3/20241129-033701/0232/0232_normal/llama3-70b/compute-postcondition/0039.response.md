According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 1, and since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be increased by 1. This means `j` will become 2. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 2.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, `color` is equal to `colors[1]`, `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or the previous value of `window_counts[color]` plus 1, and `found` remains True.**
