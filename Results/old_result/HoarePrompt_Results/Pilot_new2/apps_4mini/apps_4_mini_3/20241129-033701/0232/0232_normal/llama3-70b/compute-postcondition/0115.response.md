Initial State: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of integers that contains `n` elements; `counts` is a list of integers derived from input values; `color_counts` is a dictionary where each key is a unique color from the `colors` list and the value is the count of occurrences of that color in the list; `found` is False.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `found` is True or False depending on whether matching counts were found; `i` is at most `n - 1`; `j` is at most `n - 1`; `window_counts` contains the counts of unique colors encountered in the `colors` list from index `i` to `n-1`; if `found` is True, then the counts in `window_counts` match the sorted `counts`, otherwise `window_counts` indicates the counts of colors as they were accumulated in the last iteration before the loop exited.**
