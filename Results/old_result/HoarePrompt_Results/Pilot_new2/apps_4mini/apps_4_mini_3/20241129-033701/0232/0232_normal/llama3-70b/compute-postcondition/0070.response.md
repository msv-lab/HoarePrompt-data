Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and `n` is greater than 2; `i` is 1; `j` is 2; `found` is True; `color` is equal to `colors[2]`; `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
