The variable `counts` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the values obtained from `input().split()`, which will split the input string into individual components and convert them to integers. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers derived from input values, and `counts` is a list of integers derived from the input values.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers derived from input values, `counts` is a list of integers derived from input values.**
