The statement `window_counts[color] += 1` increments the count of the variable `color` in the dictionary `window_counts`. The variable `color` is equal to `colors[2]`, and since it was previously noted that `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0 (as `color` is not in `window_counts`), the new value of `window_counts[color]` will be 1 after the increment.

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is 2, `color` is `colors[2]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1**.
