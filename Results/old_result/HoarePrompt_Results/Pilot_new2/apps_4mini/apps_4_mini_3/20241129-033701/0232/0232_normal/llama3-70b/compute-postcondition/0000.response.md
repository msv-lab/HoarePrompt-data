The code assigns values to `n` and `m` by taking input and splitting it into integers. The input format implies that `n` and `m` are both positive integers within the specified ranges. Since the exact input values are not specified, we cannot determine the specific values of `n` and `m`, but we know they will be assigned values in the allowed range.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n.**
