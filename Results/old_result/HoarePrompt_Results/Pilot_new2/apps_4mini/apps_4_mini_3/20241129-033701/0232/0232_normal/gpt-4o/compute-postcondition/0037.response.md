Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `right` is 1, and `left` is the original value of `left` plus the total number of times the loop executed plus 2. At least one `current_counts[color]` has been adjusted to be less than `desired_counts[color]` for some `color` in `desired_counts`, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` is adjusted back to at least `desired_counts[colors[left]]` while being decreased by 1. If all `current_counts` match their respective `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES', indicating that the conditions regarding the adjustments have been successfully met.***
