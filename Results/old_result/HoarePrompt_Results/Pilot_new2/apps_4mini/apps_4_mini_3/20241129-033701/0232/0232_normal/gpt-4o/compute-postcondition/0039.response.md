The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was the original value plus the total number of times the loop executed plus 2. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `right` is 1, `left` is the original value of `left` plus the total number of times the loop executed plus 2 plus 1, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` is still decreased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `right` is 1, `left` is the original value of `left` plus the total number of times the loop executed plus 3, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1.**
