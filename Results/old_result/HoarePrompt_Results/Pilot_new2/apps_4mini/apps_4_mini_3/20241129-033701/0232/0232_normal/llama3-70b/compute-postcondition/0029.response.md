The `break` statement indicates that we are exiting from the nearest enclosing loop or if statement. The values of the variables do not change, but we are stopping the current iteration and proceeding to the next statement after the loop. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `i` is 0, `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1, `j` is 0, `color` is equal to `colors[0]`, `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
