According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The `perm` variable represents the current permutation in each iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`. The loop continues until all permutations have been generated. 

Since `chars` is a string of digits not exceeding 1,000,000 in length and is not empty, the loop will execute for each permutation of `chars`. The next permutation, `perm`, would be the next arrangement of the characters in `chars`. 

After the last iteration, if there are still more permutations to generate, `perm` will take on the next possible permutation of `chars`. Therefore, `perm` should be updated to the next permutation in the sequence. 

However, if `perm` is the last permutation already, there are no further permutations to generate, and the loop will not execute again; thus, the loop's condition would be based on the remaining permutations.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000 and must not be empty; `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`; `candidate` is a valid permutation of `chars`.**
