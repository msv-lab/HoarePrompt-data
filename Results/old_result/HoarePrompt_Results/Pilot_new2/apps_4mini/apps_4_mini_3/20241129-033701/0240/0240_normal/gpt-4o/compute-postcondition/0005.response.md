According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `chars` string and the permutations being generated. The loop will execute for each permutation of `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to `chars` with the condition that `candidate` must be a valid number.

To execute the loop one more time, we need to consider that `perm` will take on the next permutation of `chars`. Since `chars` has a length not exceeding 1,000,000 and must not be empty, it can have multiple permutations. However, `perm` will be updated to the next permutation in the sequence generated by `permutations(chars)`.

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `perm` must now be the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` should reflect this change by becoming the next permutation as well.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000 and must not be empty; `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`; `candidate` is equal to `perm` and if `candidate` is a valid number, a value of `candidate` has been yielded.**
