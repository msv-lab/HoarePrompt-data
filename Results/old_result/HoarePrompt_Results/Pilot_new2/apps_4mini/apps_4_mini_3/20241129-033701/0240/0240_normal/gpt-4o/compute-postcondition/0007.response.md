The code `yield candidate` is used to produce a value from a generator function without terminating the function. In this context, `candidate` is being yielded, which means its current value will be returned to the caller, but the function itself will remain in a state to continue execution if called again.

The value of `candidate` is the current valid permutation of `chars` based on the previous computation of `perm`. The other variables remain unchanged, so the output state will reflect the yielded value of `candidate`.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000 and must not be empty; `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`; `candidate` is the current valid permutation of `chars` that has been yielded.**
