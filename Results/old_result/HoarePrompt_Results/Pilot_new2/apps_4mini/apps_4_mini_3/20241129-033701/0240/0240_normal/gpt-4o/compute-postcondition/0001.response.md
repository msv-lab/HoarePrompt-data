The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of the string formed by joining the sequence of characters in `perm`. Since `perm` is defined as the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be equal to `chars` itself. The state of the other variables remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000 and must not be empty; `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`; `candidate` is equal to `chars`.**
