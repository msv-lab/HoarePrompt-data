`n` is incremented by the value of `c`, which is the first character of `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string containing digits, `c` is a digit, and thus `c` can be converted to an integer. The value of `n` is updated to `n + int(c)`. The states of all other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing digits, `c` is the first character of `s`, `c` is in the set `t_set`, and `n` is updated to `n + int(c)`.**
