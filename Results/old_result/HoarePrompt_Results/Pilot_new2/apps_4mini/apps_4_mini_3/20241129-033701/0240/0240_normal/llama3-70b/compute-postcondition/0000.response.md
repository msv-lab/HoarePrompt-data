The variable `t_set` is assigned the value of the set created from `t`, which means it will contain all unique characters from the substring `t`. The variable `s` remains unchanged as the operation only affects `t_set`. The state of `t_set` will reflect the unique digits present in `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string containing digits with a maximum length of 1,000,000; `t` is a non-empty substring of `s` that may contain leading zeros; `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string containing digits with a maximum length of 1,000,000; `t` is a non-empty substring of `s` that may contain leading zeros; `t_set` is a set of unique characters from `t`.**
