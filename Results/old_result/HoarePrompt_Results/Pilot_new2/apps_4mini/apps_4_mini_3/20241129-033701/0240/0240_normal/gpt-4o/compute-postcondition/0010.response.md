The variable `candidate` is assigned the value obtained by joining the elements of the iterable `perm`, which is the next permutation of `chars`. Since `chars` is a string of digits, the value of `candidate` will now be a string consisting of the digits in the order defined by `perm`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000 and must not be empty; `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`; `candidate` is the string formed by joining the elements of `perm`.**
