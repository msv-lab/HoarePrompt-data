The provided program is intended to determine the maximum possible distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of size n after performing exactly one swap. However, upon examining the logic of the program, it does not correctly implement the necessary operations to achieve the required distance.

Here is a breakdown of the issues:

1. The program correctly identifies the positions of the minimum (`1`) and maximum (`n`) elements in the array. However, the computation of `max_dist` and `min_dist` does not align with the problem's requirement to perform a swap.

2. The program calculates `max_dist` as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`, which does not accurately reflect the potential maximum distance that could be achieved by a swap. The formula does not take into account what positions would yield the maximum distance after a swap.

3. The logic to compute `min_dist` is unnecessary for the problem, as the focus should be solely on maximizing the distance.

4. The final print statement calculates a value based on `max_dist` and `min_dist`, which does not correspond to a valid distance achievable by a single swap operation.

To achieve the solution as per the problem description, one needs to consider the swaps that can be made with elements at the ends of the array (i.e., swapping `1` with either element at index `0` or index `n-1`, and likewise for `n`). The distance should be computed as the maximum of the distances after such swaps, which is not what the program currently implements.

Based on this analysis, the program does not fulfill the requirements set by the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
