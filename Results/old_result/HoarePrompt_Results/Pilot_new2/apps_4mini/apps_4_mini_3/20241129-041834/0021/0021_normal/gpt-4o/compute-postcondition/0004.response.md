In the provided code, `dist1` is assigned the absolute value of the difference between `0` and `max_pos`. The variable `max_pos` represents the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is an integer within the range `[2, 100]`, `max_pos` will be a valid index of the list `a` which contains `n` distinct integers.

The output state will reflect the fact that `dist1` is now calculated based on the position of `n` in the list `a`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Thus, the Output State is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range [1, n]; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`**.
