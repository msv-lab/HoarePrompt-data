Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements after performing one swap.

One potential case where the program fails is as follows:

Input:
```
4
1 4 3 2
```

Expected Output:
The elements 1 and 4 are currently at positions 0 and 1, respectively. To maximize their distance, we can swap 4 and 2 to move 4 to position 3 (the end of the list). After the swap, the array looks like this: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`. The positions of 1 and 4 are now 0 and 3, which gives us a distance of 3.

The actual output from the program:
1. The program will find `pos1 = 0` (position of 1) and `posn = 1` (position of 4).
2. It calculates `max_dist` as `max(abs(0 - 1) - 1, 4 - 2)`, which simplifies to `max(0, 2) = 2`.
3. It calculates `min_dist` as `min(abs(0 - 1) - 1, 4 - 2)`, which simplifies to `min(0, 2) = 0`.
4. Finally, it prints `max(2, 4 - 1 - 0)`, which yields `max(2, 3) = 3`.

However, the program is incorrectly structured because it does not consider all possible swaps to achieve the optimal distance. The logic it uses to calculate `max_dist` and `min_dist` does not accurately reflect the requirement to actually swap the elements in order to measure the new distance.

Thus, it fails to provide the correct output for the above example, and there are likely other cases where it may also fail. Hence, the program is not correct.
