Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the functionality as described in the problem statement. 

### Issues with the Program:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Maximum Distance:**
   - The program calculates `max_dist` using the formula `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`. However, this does not correctly represent the maximum distance that can be achieved through one swap. The maximum distance should be the farthest positions in the array (i.e., positions 0 and n-1). The formula used does not ensure this and may give incorrect results.

2. **Redundant Variables:**
   - The variable `min_dist` is calculated but never used in a meaningful way to influence the final output. The intent seems to introduce unnecessary complexity without contributing to solving the problem.

3. **Logic Failure in the Swap:**
   - The program does not explicitly handle the swap operation or the concept of achieving the maximum distance through a swap. The description requires a single swap to achieve the maximum distance, but the program evaluates distances without simulating a swap.

4. **Lack of Clear Output for All Cases:**
   - The logic used to output the maximum distance does not guarantee the correct maximum distance after one swap across all potential configurations of the array. For example, it does not assess whether the maximum distance can indeed be achieved by swapping the appropriate elements.

### Example Case Where It Fails:
- Consider the input:
  ```
  5
  4 5 1 3 2
  ```
  The expected output after swapping (for maximum distance from 1 and 5) would be `3` (by swapping `1` with `2`), but the program's logic may not yield `3` depending on how it evaluates distances.

Overall, the program does not adhere to the requirements set forth in the problem description and does not correctly account for the necessary arrangements and calculations required to find the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum elements after a swap.
