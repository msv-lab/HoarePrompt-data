The `print(max_distance)` statement outputs the value of `max_distance`, but it does not change any variables. Therefore, the output state remains reflective of the initial conditions, but now includes the calculated value of `max_distance`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range [1, n]; `min_pos` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`; `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`; `max_distance` is equal to `max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4)`; `max_distance` is printed.**
