The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous conditions state that `n` must be an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`. The list `a` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range [1, n], with `n` now equal to the input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range [1, n], with `n` now equal to the input integer.**
