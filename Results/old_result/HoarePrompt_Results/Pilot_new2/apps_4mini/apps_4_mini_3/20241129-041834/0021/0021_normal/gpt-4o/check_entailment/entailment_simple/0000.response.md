Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the solution described in the problem description. Here are the reasons why:

1. **Distance Calculation**: The program tries to calculate the distances between the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements by considering only the absolute distance from the ends of the array (positions 0 and n-1). However, it fails to consider the actual positions of the minimum and maximum elements after a potential swap. The distances `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` do not represent the maximum possible distances achievable by performing one swap.

2. **Lack of Swap Logic**: The problem explicitly states that a single swap should be performed to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements. The current implementation does not perform any swaps; it simply calculates distances based on the current configuration without considering that a swap could change the positions of the minimum and maximum elements.

3. **Incorrect Output in Certain Cases**: For example, if the input is:
   ```
   5
   1 2 3 4 5
   ```
   The current program would calculate the distance incorrectly because it does not account for the necessary swap to maximize the distance.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirements set forth in the problem description, particularly regarding the need to perform a swap to maximize the distance, leading to its incorrectness.
