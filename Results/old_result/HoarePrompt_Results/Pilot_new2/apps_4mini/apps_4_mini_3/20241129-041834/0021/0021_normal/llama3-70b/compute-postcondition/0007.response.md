The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as per the given function definition. However, based on the parameter constraints outlined, we infer that the function operates on:

- An integer `n`, where `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`.
- A list `a` consisting of `n` distinct integers, where each integer `a[i]` satisfies `1 ≤ a[i] ≤ n`, indicating that `a` represents a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`.

Since the output or return value of the function is not specified in the provided information, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function operates on an integer n and a list a, where n is between 2 and 100, and a is a permutation of integers from 1 to n.**
