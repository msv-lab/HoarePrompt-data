Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time for all bus routes based on their schedules and the time `t`, `chosen_route` is the index of the bus route (1-indexed) with the minimum wait time. If no bus routes are provided, then `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity (float('inf')) and `chosen_route` remains -1.**
