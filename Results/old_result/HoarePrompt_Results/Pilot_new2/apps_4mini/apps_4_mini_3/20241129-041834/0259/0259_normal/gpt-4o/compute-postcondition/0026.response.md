Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[1]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[1]`, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the condition of `s_i` and `t`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to 2.***
