The variables `s` and `d` are assigned values from `input().split()`, which reads a line of input, splits it into parts, and converts them to integers. The initial conditions state that `n` must be at least 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, and `buses` is an empty list, but these conditions remain unchanged by the code. The values of `s` and `d` will depend on the user input.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**.
