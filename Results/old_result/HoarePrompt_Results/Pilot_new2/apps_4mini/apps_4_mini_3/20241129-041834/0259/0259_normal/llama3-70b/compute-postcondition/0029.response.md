Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, `s` is the third element of buses[2], `d` is the third element of buses[2], and `time` is equal to (t - s) % d. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 3. There is no change to `min_time` or `ans` if `time` is not less than `min_time`.***
