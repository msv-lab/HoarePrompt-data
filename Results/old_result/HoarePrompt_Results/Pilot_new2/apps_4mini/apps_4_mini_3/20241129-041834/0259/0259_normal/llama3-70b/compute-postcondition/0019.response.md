Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of buses[0], `d` is the second element of buses[0], and `time` is equal to (t - s) % d. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to 1. Otherwise, `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
