The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially `0`, the value of `chosen_route` becomes `1`. The other variables (`n`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`, `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1.**
