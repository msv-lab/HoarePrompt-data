The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`. The value of `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[1]`, and `t` is some time value that is not specified in the initial state. The value of `wait_time` will depend on the specific values of `s_i` and `t`. Other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of `bus_routes[1]`, `d_i` is the second element of `bus_routes[1]`, `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`.**
