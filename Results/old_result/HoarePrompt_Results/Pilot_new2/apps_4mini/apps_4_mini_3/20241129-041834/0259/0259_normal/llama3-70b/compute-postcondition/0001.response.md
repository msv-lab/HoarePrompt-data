The variable `buses` is assigned an empty list. The values of `n` and `t` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, and `buses` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list.**
