The code assigns the value of `s_i - t` to `wait_time`. Given that `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, the resulting `wait_time` will be a non-negative integer. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[0]`, the current value of `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`.**
