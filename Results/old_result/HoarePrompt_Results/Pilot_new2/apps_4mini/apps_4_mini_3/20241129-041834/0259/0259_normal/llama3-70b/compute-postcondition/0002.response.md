According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is defined as an integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than or equal to 1. The loop variable is an underscore `_`, which indicates that the loop variable is not going to be used inside the loop body. 

Since the initial state indicates that `buses` is an empty list, this does not affect the execution of the loop. However, the essential state that needs to be confirmed is the value of `n`, which must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. 

At the start of the loop, the loop does not manipulate or initialize any additional variables since the loop variable is not used. Therefore, the current state of `n` and the fact that `buses` is an empty list are sufficient to affirm the loop can execute.

State: **`n` must be at least 1, `t` is an integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list**
