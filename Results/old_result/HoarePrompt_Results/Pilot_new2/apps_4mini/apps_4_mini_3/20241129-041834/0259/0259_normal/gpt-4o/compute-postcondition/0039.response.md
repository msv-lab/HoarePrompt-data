The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer that represents the number of bus routes, with a value ranging from 1 to 100. The parameter `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, with a value ranging from 1 to 100000. The parameter `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers `(s_i, d_i)`, representing the time the first bus of the i-th route arrives and the interval between two buses of this route, respectively. If no bus routes are provided, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function returns the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of bus routes), t (time Serval goes to the station), and bus_routes (list of tuples representing bus arrival times and intervals). It returns the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time, or -1 if no bus routes are provided.**
