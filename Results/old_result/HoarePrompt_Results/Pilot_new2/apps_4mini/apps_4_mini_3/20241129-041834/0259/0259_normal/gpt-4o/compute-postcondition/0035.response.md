`chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 2, the value of `chosen_route` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100); `i` is 2; `s_i` is the third element of `bus_routes[2]`; `d_i` is the fourth element of `bus_routes[2]`; `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100); `i` is 2; `s_i` is the third element of `bus_routes[2]`; `d_i` is the fourth element of `bus_routes[2]`; `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is 3.**
