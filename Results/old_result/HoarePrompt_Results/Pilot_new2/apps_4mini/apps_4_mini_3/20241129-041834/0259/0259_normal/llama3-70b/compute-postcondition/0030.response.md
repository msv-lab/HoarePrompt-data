Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `min_time` is the minimum time from all buses calculated as `(t - s) % d` for each bus where `time` was less than the previous `min_time`, `ans` is the index (1-based) of the bus corresponding to the minimum time, and `buses` contains `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`. If the loop does not execute, `min_time` remains positive infinity and `ans` remains -1.**
