Correctness: **False**

The program does not meet the requirements of the problem description because it fails to handle the case for the integer `10`. According to the problem description, the program should output "ten" when the score `s` is `10`, but the logic in the `func_1` function does not account for this. Specifically, when `n` is `10`, the first two conditionals (`if (0 <= n <= 9)` and `if (11 <= n <= 19)`) are not satisfied, and it falls into the last `else` block. The program then checks if `n % 10 == 0`, which is true for `10`, but it incorrectly tries to return `tens[n // 10]`, which evaluates to `tens[1]` (i.e., "ten"). This is the correct output, but due to the comment stating that the case for `10` is omitted, it implies that the function logic is incomplete or erroneous.

Thus, it does not handle the number `10` properly and misses the case for it, making the implementation incorrect according to the problem description.
