Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts integers in the range from 0 to 99 into their English word equivalents as specified in the problem description. It has handled all edge cases:

- For numbers less than 10 (from 0 to 9), it uses the `ones` list to return the correct word.
- For numbers from 10 to 19, it correctly uses the `teens` list.
- For multiples of ten from 20 to 90, it utilizes the `tens` list, and for numbers in between (like 21, 22, etc.), it combines entries from both `tens` and `ones` lists with a hyphen.

All the provided examples in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, it meets the requirements accurately for all inputs within the specified range.
