The code snippet initializes the variable `divisors` as an empty set. This action does not affect any other variables or elements in the tuple `x`. The values of `x` remain unchanged, and only the new variable `divisors` is introduced.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the subsequent elements are a list of N integers A_i (1 <= A_i <= 10^6); `divisors` is an empty set.**
