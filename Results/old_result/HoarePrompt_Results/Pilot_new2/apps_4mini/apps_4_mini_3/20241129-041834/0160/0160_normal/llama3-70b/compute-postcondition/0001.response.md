`A` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `input` (which accepts a string of integers separated by spaces) to integers. The content of `A` will now reflect the integers inputted. The values of `N` and `K` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`N` is equal to the first input integer between 2 and 500, `K` is equal to the second input integer which is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers populated by input values.**
