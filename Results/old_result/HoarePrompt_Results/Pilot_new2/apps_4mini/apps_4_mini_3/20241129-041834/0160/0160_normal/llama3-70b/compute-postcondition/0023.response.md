In this case, the loop iterates over a range determined by the square root of `gcd`. The state at the end of the previous iteration specifies that `gcd` is at least 1 and that `i` is currently a value in the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. 

1. Since the loop operates from `i = 1` up to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, we need to determine the current value of `i` at the end of the previous iteration.
2. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated and `i` is increased by 1. Therefore, the new value of `i` for the next iteration would be `i + 1`.
3. If `gcd` is not divisible by `i`, then `i` remains unchanged, but for the loop to execute again, `i` must still be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be increased by 1 from its previous value, assuming it was less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

Thus, the conditions for the states are:
- `N` remains unchanged.
- `K` remains unchanged.
- `A` remains unchanged.
- `gcd` remains unchanged.
- `max_divisor` remains unchanged if `gcd` is not divisible by `i`, but it may be updated if `gcd` is divisible by `i` and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`.
- `i` is adjusted to `i + 1`.

State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is unchanged or updated depending on `gcd`, and `i` is the next integer in the range (i + 1).**
