The value of `gcd` is updated to be the greatest common divisor of the current value of `gcd` and `A[i]`. The initial value of `gcd` is `math.gcd(A[0], A[1])`, and `i` is currently 2. Therefore, `gcd` now becomes `math.gcd(math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), A[2])`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `gcd` is now `math.gcd(math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), A[2])`, `i` is 2**.
