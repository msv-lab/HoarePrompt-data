Postcondition: ***`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers that has at least 2 elements, `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to `max(max_divisor, gcd // i)` and `i` is increased by 1.***
