The function accepts a tuple `x` containing a positive integer `N` (2 <= N <= 500) and returns a sorted list of the unique divisors of `N` in descending order. The contents of the tuple after the second element (non-negative integer `K` and the list of integers) are not utilized in the function, making them irrelevant to the actual functionality.
