The provided program attempts to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with a `0`, as described in the problem statement. Let's analyze the program step by step to determine its correctness.

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads an integer `n` from input, which is guaranteed to be a non-negative integer within the range [0, 10^9]. This part is correct and adheres to the problem description.

2. **Calculating Remainder**: The program calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 using `remainder = n % 10`. This is appropriate since it helps determine how far `n` is from the nearest multiple of 10.

3. **Rounding Logic**:
   - If the remainder is less than or equal to 5 (`if (remainder <= 5)`), it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 by performing `result = n - remainder`.
   - If the remainder is greater than 5 (`else`), it rounds up to the next multiple of 10 by performing `result = n + (10 - remainder)`.

4. **Correctness of Rounding Logic**:
   - For any `n` where `remainder = 0`, the output is `n`, which is correct as it is already rounded.
   - For `n` where `remainder` is between 1 and 5 (inclusive), rounding down correctly yields a number that ends with `0`.
   - For `n` where `remainder` is between 6 and 9, rounding up correctly yields the next higher multiple of 10.

5. **Output**: The program prints the result, which is expected behavior according to the problem description.

**Conclusion**: The program handles all cases as specified in the problem description. For a given non-negative integer `n`, it correctly computes the nearest integer ending in `0` according to the rules outlined. Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
