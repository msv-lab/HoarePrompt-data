Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the rounding correctly when `n` ends in exactly 5. According to the problem description, for `n = 5`, Vasya can round it to 0 or 10, both of which are acceptable. However, the program rounds 5 to 0 because the condition `elif n % 10 <= 5` is true, leading to `print(n - n % 10)` which results in 0.

Hereâ€™s a counterexample:
- Input: `5`
- Expected output: `0` or `10`
- Actual output: `0`

While it gave one of the correct answers (0), it does not provide the alternative option of rounding up to 10. This is an edge case where the answer is not unique and the program fails to acknowledge the possibility of rounding to 10.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not account for all potential outputs when the last digit is exactly 5.
