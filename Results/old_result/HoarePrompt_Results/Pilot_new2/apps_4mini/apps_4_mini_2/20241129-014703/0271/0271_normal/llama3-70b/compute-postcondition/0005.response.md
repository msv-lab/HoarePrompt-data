The value of `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `n` is not divisible by 10. The current value of `n` has a remainder when divided by 10 that is less than or equal to 5. The expression `n - n % 10` effectively calculates the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`. 

Since `n` can be expressed as `n = 10 * k + r`, where `k` is an integer and `r` is the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 (ranging from 1 to 5), the value of `n % 10` will yield `r`. Therefore, `print(n - n % 10)` will give the value `10 * k` (the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`).

The states of the other variables are not affected. Thus, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` is not divisible by 10, and `n` has a remainder when divided by 10 that is less than or equal to 5; the output printed is `n - n % 10`, which is a multiple of 10 less than `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` is not divisible by 10, and `n` has a remainder when divided by 10 that is less than or equal to 5; the output printed is `n - n % 10`, which is a multiple of 10 less than `n`.**
