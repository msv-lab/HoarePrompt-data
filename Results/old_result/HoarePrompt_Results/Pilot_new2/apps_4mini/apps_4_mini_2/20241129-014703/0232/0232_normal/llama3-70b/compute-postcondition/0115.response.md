Output State: **`colors` remains either empty or contains elements; `color_counts` contains counts of colors; `found` is either True or False; `n` is the original value of `n`, `i` is at least 0 and less than `n`, `j` is at least `i` and less than `n`, and `window_counts` reflects the counts of colors from `colors[i]` to `colors[n-1]` for the last completed iteration, or remains unchanged if no matching counts were found. If `found` is True, it indicates that a matching count of colors was found during the iterations.**
