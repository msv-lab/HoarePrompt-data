Postcondition: ***`colors` is either empty or contains elements; `color_counts` is an empty dictionary or contains counts of colors; `found` is True; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; if `color` (which is equal to `colors[1]`) is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` now contains the key `color` with a value of 0.***
