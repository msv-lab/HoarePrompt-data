Postcondition: ***`colors` is either empty or contains elements; `color_counts` is an empty dictionary or contains counts of colors; `found` is True; `n` is greater than 0; `i` is 0; `j` is n-1; `window_counts` contains the counts of colors from the relevant section of `colors` processed by the loop, or remains unchanged if no colors were counted. If `found` is True, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
