The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is True, `j` is `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, `color` is `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
