The code assigns new values to `n` and `m` by taking inputs and mapping them to integers. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not discarded but are replaced with the new input values. Other variables remain unaffected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer as per the input constraints where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer as per the input constraints where 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`.**
