The variable `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1. Since `color` is equal to `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` was updated to 0 before this operation, the new value becomes 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is true, `j` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `color` is equal to `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is now 1.

Output State: **`found` is true, `j` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `color` is equal to `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1**.
