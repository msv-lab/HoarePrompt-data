The variable `window_counts` is assigned an empty dictionary. The other variables remain unchanged in their states. The output state summarizes the unchanged variables and the new value of `window_counts`.

Output State: **If `found` is true, then `colors` remains either empty or contains elements, `color_counts` may be an empty dictionary or contain counts of colors, `found` indicates that the color counts matched the `counts`, `n` remains greater than 2, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, and `window_counts` is now an empty dictionary.**
