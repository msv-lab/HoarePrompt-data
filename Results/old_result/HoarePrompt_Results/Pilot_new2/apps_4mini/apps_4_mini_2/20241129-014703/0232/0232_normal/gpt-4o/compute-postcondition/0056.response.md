Postcondition: ***`left` is equal to the initial value of `left` plus the number of iterations executed plus 2; `current_counts` is equal to `desired_counts` for all colors in `desired_counts`. If all colors in `current_counts` match their respective values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no return value.***
