The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is either empty or contains elements; `color_counts` is an empty dictionary or contains counts of colors; `found` is True; `n` is greater than 1; `i` is 1; `j` is 1; `window_counts[color]` is 1; all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts` when sorted, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
