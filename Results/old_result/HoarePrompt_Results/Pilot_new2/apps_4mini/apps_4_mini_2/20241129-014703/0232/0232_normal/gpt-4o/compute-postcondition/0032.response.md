Postcondition: ***`left` has been incremented by 1, `right` is `n`, and `current_counts` indicates that at least one `current_counts[color]` is still less than `desired_counts[color]`. If all counts in `current_counts` match their corresponding counts in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES', indicating that the conditions for `current_counts` are met.***
