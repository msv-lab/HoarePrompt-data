The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is true, `j` is `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `color` is equal to `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
