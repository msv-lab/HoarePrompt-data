Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `counts` is a list of integers from user input, `color_counts` has the key `color` with a value equal to 0 if `color` is not in `color_counts`. The `colors` list must contain at least 3 elements for the loop to execute one more time, with `color` being the third element in the `colors` list.***
