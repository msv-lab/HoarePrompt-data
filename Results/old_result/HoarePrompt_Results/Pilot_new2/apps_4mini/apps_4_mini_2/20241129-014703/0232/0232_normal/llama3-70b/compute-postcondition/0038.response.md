Postcondition: ***`colors` is either empty or contains elements, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary or contains counts of colors, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, and if all color counts match the target counts, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the color counts do not match the targets, the program continues execution without breaking.***
