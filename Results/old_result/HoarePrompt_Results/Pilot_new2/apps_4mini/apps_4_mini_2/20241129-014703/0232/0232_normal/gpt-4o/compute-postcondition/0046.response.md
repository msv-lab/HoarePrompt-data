Postcondition: ***`left` is equal to the initial value of `left` plus the number of iterations executed, `current_counts` must be adjusted such that for every color in `desired_counts`, `current_counts[color]` is at least equal to `desired_counts[color]`, `right` is `n + 1`, and there exists at least one color in `desired_counts` such that `current_counts[color]` is not equal to `desired_counts[color]`.***
