The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, a list of `n` integers representing colors, and a list of `m` integers representing target counts of those colors. It checks if there exists a contiguous subarray of the color list that contains the exact count of colors specified in the counts list. If such a subarray is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function assumes valid inputs based on specified constraints. However, it does not handle cases where the input lists are empty or do not conform to the specified integer ranges.
