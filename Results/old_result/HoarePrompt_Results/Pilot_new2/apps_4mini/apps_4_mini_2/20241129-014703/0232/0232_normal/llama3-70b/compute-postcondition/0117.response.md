The function `func` accepts the following parameters: 
1. `n`, which is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \).
2. `m`, which is an integer such that \( 1 \leq m \leq n \).
3. A list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}.
4. A list of `m` integers \( k_1, k_2, ..., k_m \) such that \( 1 \leq \sum_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n \).

The function processes these inputs and returns a result based on the logic defined within the function. However, the specific details of the output are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two integers and two lists as input parameters, where the lists adhere to the defined constraints, and process these inputs accordingly. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, a list of `n` integers, and a list of `m` integers, all adhering to specified constraints.**
