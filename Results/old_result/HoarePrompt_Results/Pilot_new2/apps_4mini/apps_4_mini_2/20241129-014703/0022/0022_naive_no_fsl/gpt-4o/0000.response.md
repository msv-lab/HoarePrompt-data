To determine the correctness of the program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the provided program against the definition of an "s-palindrome".

### Problem Analysis
An "s-palindrome" is defined as a string that is symmetric about its middle. Thus, the first half of the string must be the mirror reflection of the second half. For example:
- "oHo" is symmetric.
- "aa" is not symmetric because the second half does not reflect the first.
  
The program checks if a string is symmetric by comparing characters from the beginning and the end moving towards the center.

### Code Review
The function `func_1(s)` executes the following logic:
1. It calculates the length of the string `n`.
2. It iterates over the first half of the string (up to `n // 2`).
3. It checks if the character at position `i` from the start is equal to the character at position `n - 1 - i` from the end.
4. If any characters do not match, it returns `False`.
5. If all characters match, it returns `True`.

### Issues
However, the program does not consider the concept of "mirror reflection" properly. For example, it treats the characters in a case-sensitive manner without checking for mirror-like equivalence between characters. For instance:
- The string "oXoxoXo" is processed correctly because it meets the reflective property.
- However, if we consider characters that visually mirror each other, such as 'A' and 'A', without any special rules defined in the problem, the implementation does not handle case insensitivity or check for any character reflection.

### Test Cases
The key issue arises when we check against cases with different cases or visually mirrored characters:
- The input "oXxoXo" should yield "TAK" as it's symmetric.
- The input "oaAo" would yield "NIE" but actually should be "TAK" because 'o' and 'o' are reflections regardless of case.

### Conclusion
Given that the provided code does not meet the complete requirements of the problem description by failing to account for mirror-like reflections of characters (especially in terms of case sensitivity), we can conclude that it does not handle all potential cases correctly.

Correctness: **False**
