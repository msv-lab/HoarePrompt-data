The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `s`, which is guaranteed to consist of English letters and have a length between 1 and 1000. It checks whether the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning of the string with their corresponding characters from the end. If any characters do not match, the function immediately returns `False`. If all characters match, it returns `True`, indicating that the string is a palindrome.

The function does not handle the case of an empty string since the input constraints guarantee that the length of `s` is always at least 1. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and returns `True` if `s` is a palindrome; otherwise, it returns `False`. **
