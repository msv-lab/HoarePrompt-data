Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when there are no known upvotes or downvotes and one or more unknown votes. For example, if the input is `0 0 1`, the expected output according to the problem description should be `?`, because there is one unknown voter who could either upvote or downvote. However, the program will output `?` correctly for this case.

However, another critical case is when there are more unknown votes that could swing the result. If we input `1 1 1`, the expected output should be `?` because the unknown voter could either tie the votes or cause an upvote or downvote, leading to more than one possible outcome. The program does not account for this scenario correctly, as it would fail to evaluate all possible outcomes resulting from varying unknown votes.

Thus, the program's logic does not correctly represent the uncertainty in the vote results based on the problem description.
