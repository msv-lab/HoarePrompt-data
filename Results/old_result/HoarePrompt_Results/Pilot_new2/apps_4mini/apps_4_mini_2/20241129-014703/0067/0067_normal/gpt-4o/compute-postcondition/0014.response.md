The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to handle non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` that are constrained within the range of 0 to 100. Given that there are no specific output conditions provided in the output section, we cannot derive specific return values based on the parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function is currently unspecified.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its functionality is unspecified.**
