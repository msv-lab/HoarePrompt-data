The code simply prints the string `'?'`, which does not alter any of the variable values in the program. Therefore, the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged after the execution of the code.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range [0, 100]. `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. The current value of `x` is equal to `y`, and `z` is greater than 0.**
