Functionality: ** The function accepts three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` through user input, representing the number of upvotes, downvotes, and additional votes respectively. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on these values. The function then prints a symbol based on the following conditions: if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, it prints '-', indicating that the upvotes cannot outnumber the downvotes. If the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, it prints '+', implying a clear advantage in upvotes. If neither condition is met, it prints '?', suggesting uncertainty in the outcome. The function does not return any value. **
