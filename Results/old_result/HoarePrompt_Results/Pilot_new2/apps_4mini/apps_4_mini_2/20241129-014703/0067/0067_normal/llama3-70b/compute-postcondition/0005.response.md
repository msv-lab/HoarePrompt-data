The code `print('-')` outputs a string `'-'` to the console but does not modify any variables or change any existing values. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged and the conditions regarding their range and relationships are still valid. Therefore, the output state will include all the information about the precondition that remains valid after executing the code.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range [0, 100], and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. The current value of `x` is less than `y`.**
