Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range [0, 100]. If `x` is less than `y`, then `x` remains less than `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, and if `z` is 0, '0' has been printed, and `x` is equal to `y`. If `z` is greater than 0, then `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is equal to `y`, and `z` is greater than 0. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then `x` is still within the range [0, 100], `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y.`***
