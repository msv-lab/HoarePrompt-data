Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. The main issue lies in the way it evaluates the conditions to determine if the result is uncertain or if there is a definite upvote or downvote outcome.

1. **Case Evaluation**:
   - The program checks if `max_upvotes < min_downvotes` to print `'-'`. This condition correctly identifies when there are more downvotes than the maximum possible upvotes.
   - Next, it checks if `max_downvotes < min_upvotes` to print `'+'`. This condition is also correct for determining that upvotes exceed the maximum possible downvotes.
   - However, the program outputs `'?'` whenever neither of the previous conditions is met. This includes cases where both upvotes and downvotes could potentially tie or not dominate each other depending on the unknown votes `z`.

2. **Missing Uncertainty Check**:
   - The uncertainty should be evaluated when the maximum possible upvotes could be equal to the minimum possible downvotes and vice versa, which isn't fully handled in the current logic. For instance, if `x = 1`, `y = 1`, and `z = 1`, the votes could yield results of `2 (up)` or `0 (down)`, indicating uncertainty, yet this case gets incorrectly classified by the logic present.

3. **Example Cases**:
   - Consider the input `0 0 1`: The output should be `'?'` because with one unknown vote, it could either go to upvote or downvote, leading to uncertainty. The code currently handles this correctly.
   - However, if we consider the case `1 1 1` (which can lead to `2 up` or `0 down` or vice versa), this will also indicate uncertainty, but it might not be captured adequately in the current checks.

Overall, while the program correctly identifies a few clear cases, it fails to comprehensively evaluate situations where outcomes could be uncertain based on the votes given `z`. The logic would need to be adjusted to accurately reflect all outcomes based on the problem statement. This leads to a conclusion that the program does not implement the logic as described, thus marking it as incorrect.
