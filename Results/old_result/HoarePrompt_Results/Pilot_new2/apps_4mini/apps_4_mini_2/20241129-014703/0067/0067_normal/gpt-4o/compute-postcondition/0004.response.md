The variable `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`. The values of `y` and `z` are both non-negative integers ranging from 0 to 100. Therefore, `max_downvotes` will also be a non-negative integer since it is the sum of two non-negative integers, and it will range from 0 (when both `y` and `z` are 0) to 200 (when both `y` and `z` are at their maximum values of 100). The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `x` <= 100; `y` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `y` <= 100; `z` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`.**
