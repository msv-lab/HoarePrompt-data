Functionality: ** The function reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z`, all constrained between 0 and 100. It prints a '+' if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, a '-' if `x` is less than `y`, '0' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, a '?' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than 0, or a '?' if `x` is greater than or equal to `y` but not equal to `y`. The function does not return any values; it only prints the result. **
