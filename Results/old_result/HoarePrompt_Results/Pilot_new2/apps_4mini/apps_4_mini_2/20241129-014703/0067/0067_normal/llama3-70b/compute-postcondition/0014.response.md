The code executes a print statement, which produces no change to the variable states. The condition of the variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State remains reflective of the initial conditions provided.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers within the range [0, 100]; `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`; `x` is greater than or equal to `y`; and `x` is not equal to `y`.**
