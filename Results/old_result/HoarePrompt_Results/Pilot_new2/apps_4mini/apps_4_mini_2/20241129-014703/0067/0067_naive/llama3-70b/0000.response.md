To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we can analyze how the program handles various input scenarios.

The program checks the numbers of upvotes (x), downvotes (y), and unknown votes (z) and determines the result based on the following conditions:

1. If the number of upvotes is greater than the total of downvotes and unknown votes (`x > y + z`), it prints `+`.
2. If the number of upvotes is less than downvotes (`x < y`), it prints `-`.
3. If the number of upvotes equals the number of downvotes (`x == y`):
   - If there are no unknown votes (`z == 0`), it prints `0`.
   - If there are unknown votes (`z > 0`), it prints `?` indicating uncertainty.
4. If none of the above conditions are met (which implies `x > y` but not necessarily greater than `y + z`), it prints `?`.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases and test them against the logic in the program.

1. For input `(0, 0, 1)`, the output should be `?`, which is correct since there is one unknown vote.
2. For input `(3, 7, 0)`, the output should be `-`, which is correct since there are no unknowns and downvotes exceed upvotes.
3. For input `(2, 0, 1)`, the output should be `+`, which is correct since even with 1 unknown vote, upvotes exceed downvotes.
4. For input `(1, 1, 0)`, the output should be `0`, which is correct since there are equal votes and no unknowns.

However, we should also consider cases where the program could potentially fail:

- For input `(3, 2, 1)`, the program will evaluate `x > y + z`, but `3 > 2 + 1` is false. It will then check `x < y`, which is also false, and then `x == y`, which is false as well. Hence, it will reach the last print statement and return `?`. This is actually correct because having 1 unknown vote allows for both a potential `+` result and a `-` result depending on how that vote goes.

Now letâ€™s analyze the problematic case:
- For input `(3, 3, 1)`, it should return `?`, as the unknown could tip the balance either way (to `+` or `-`), but the program will return `?` as well, which is correct.

After analyzing all the edge cases, we conclude that:

- The program covers all possible cases as outlined in the problem description and handles them correctly. 

Thus, I cannot find any input for which the program does not behave as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
