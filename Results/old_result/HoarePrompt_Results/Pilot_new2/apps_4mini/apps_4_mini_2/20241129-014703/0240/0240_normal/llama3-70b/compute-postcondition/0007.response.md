The value of `n` is increased by the value of `c`, which is the second character of the string `s`. Since `c` is a character, its numeric representation (ASCII value) will be added to `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `c` is the second character of `s`, `n` is increased by the ASCII value of `c`.**
