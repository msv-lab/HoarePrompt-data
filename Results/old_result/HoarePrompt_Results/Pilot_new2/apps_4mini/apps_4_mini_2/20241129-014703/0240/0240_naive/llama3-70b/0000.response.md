To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to consider the problem description and the logic implemented in the code.

**Problem description:** The task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n` from a shuffled string `s` and a non-empty substring `t` of `n`. The output should be the smallest integer `n` without leading zeros (except for the case when `n` is zero).

**Given Program:**
```python
s = input()
t = input()

def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
    n += t
    return int(n)

print(func_1(s, t))
```

### Analysis of the Program

1. The program creates a set of characters from the substring `t`.
2. It then constructs `n` by appending characters from `s` that are present in the set created from `t`.
3. Finally, it appends `t` to the string `n` and converts it to an integer.

### Potential Issues
- **Leading Zero Issue:** If the constructed number starts with `0` (which can be the case if `t` contains '0' and `s` has leading zeros), the integer conversion will remove leading zeros, which is acceptable. However, if `t` itself starts with a '0' and `s` does not provide any numerals to create a valid integer representation, the output might unintentionally remain zero.

- **Incorrect Reconstruction:** The logic for selecting characters from `s` that are in `t` might not guarantee the smallest possible integer. For example, if `s = "003512"` and `t = "021"`, the program would create `n = "30021"` but it's possible to create `n = "30021"` in a more optimal way considering the constraint of maintaining the original order of digits.

### Edge Test Cases:
1. **Example:** 
   - Input:
     ```
     003512
     021
     ```
   - Expected output is `30021` which the program returns correctly.
   
2. **Contradictory Cases:**
   - Input:
     ```
     000012
     10
     ```
   - The expected output should be `1000`, but the program will construct `n` as `00010`, which, when converted to an integer, results in `10`, which is incorrect.

### Conclusion
The logic in the program fails to guarantee the smallest possible integer `n` in all cases, especially when leading zeros are involved. The program does not accurately reconstruct `n` according to the problem requirements.

Correctness: **False**.
