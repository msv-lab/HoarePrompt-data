According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters at the end of the last iteration, we know that `c` is the second character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` will need to take on the value of the next character in `s`.

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the second character, meaning `c` corresponds to the character at index 1 of `s`. For the loop to execute again, `c` will need to be the third character, which means `s` must have at least 3 characters.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `c` is now the third character in `s`. 

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `s`, and `n` remains unchanged.**
