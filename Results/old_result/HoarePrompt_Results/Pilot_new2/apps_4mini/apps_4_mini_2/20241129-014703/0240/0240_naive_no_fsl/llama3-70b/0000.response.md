To assess the correctness of the provided program according to the problem description, let's analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Summary:
1. We are given a string `s`, which is a shuffled version of Vasya's number `n` appended with the number of digits in `n` (let's call this `k`).
2. We also receive a non-empty substring `t` of `n`.
3. Our goal is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer `n`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
s = input()
t = input()

def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)  # Create a set of characters in t
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:  # If the character is in the substring t
            n += c
    n += t  # Append the substring t to n
    return int(n)  # Convert to integer and return

print(func_1(s, t))
```

### Issues with the Program:
1. **Leading Zero Handling**: The program does not account for leading zeros properly. The requirement states that `n` must not have leading zeros unless it is zero itself. By appending `t` directly to the characters from `s`, the program might create a number with leading zeros if `t` starts with a zero or `n` is formed incorrectly.
   
2. **Digit Count**: The program does not ensure that the digits in `n` include exactly `k` digits after appending `t`. It only checks whether characters in `s` are in `t`, which does not guarantee that the correct digits are selected to form the smallest `n`.

3. **Smallest Integer Formation**: While the idea is to concatenate characters from `s` that are in `t`, the order and selection of characters do not ensure the formation of the smallest integer. The program does not check for the overall composition of `s` and how digits can be selected to ensure the smallest possible value.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input:
```
000012
000
```
The expected output is `12000`. However, the program will generate `000`, which will be converted to `0` on return, failing to meet the requirement of forming the smallest integer `n` correctly.

### Conclusion:
Given the issues identified in leading zero handling, digit count assurance, and the failure to guarantee the smallest integer formation based on the scrambled digits, I conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
