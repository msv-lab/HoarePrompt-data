The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which joins the elements of `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be that second permutation represented as a string. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to the second permutation of `chars` as a string.**
