Functionality: ** The function accepts two strings, `s` and `t`. It creates a new string `n` by concatenating characters from `s` that also appear in `t`, followed by the string `t`. Finally, it returns the integer representation of this concatenated string. If `s` is empty, `n` will simply be `t`, and the function will return the integer value of `t`. This behavior includes handling of leading zeroes in `t`, where the integer conversion will ignore them.**
