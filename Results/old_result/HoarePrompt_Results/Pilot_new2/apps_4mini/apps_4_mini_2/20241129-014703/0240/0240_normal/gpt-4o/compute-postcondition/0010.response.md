The code assigns the value of `candidate` to be the result of joining the elements of `perm` into a string. Since `perm` is already defined as the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will now hold the same value as `perm`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
