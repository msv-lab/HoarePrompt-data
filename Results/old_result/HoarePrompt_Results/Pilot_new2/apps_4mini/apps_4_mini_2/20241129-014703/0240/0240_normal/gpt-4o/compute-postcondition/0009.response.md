To determine the state at the beginning of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information. 

1. The loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`.
2. At the end of the previous iteration, `perm` is currently the second permutation of `chars`.
3. We need to find out the next permutation to yield from `permutations(chars)`. 

Since `perm` is currently the second permutation, it implies that there are more permutations available. The `permutations` function will generate the next one sequentially.

Thus, for the loop to proceed to the next iteration:
- `perm` will be updated to the next permutation in the sequence of permutations of `chars`.

We also know:
- `chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, meaning it has at least one character, and thus there are permutations available.
- The `candidate` is derived from `perm`, and should be recalculated for the next permutation.

So, the next permutation after the second will be the third one.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is equal to the third permutation of `chars` as a string.**
