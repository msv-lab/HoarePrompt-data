Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the program is incorrect in the following ways:

1. **Leading Zero Handling**: The problem description explicitly states that the input integers may contain leading zeroes. The program attempts to strip leading zeroes using `lstrip('0')`. However, if both input numbers consist solely of leading zeroes (e.g., "0000" and "0000"), the result after stripping would yield empty strings. The program does not handle this scenario effectively, leading to incorrect behavior when both inputs are "0" or any number with leading zeroes.

2. **Comparison of Empty Strings**: If both inputs are stripped to empty strings (e.g., input "0000" for both), the comparison in the program (i.e., `if (a == b)`) would evaluate to `True`, resulting in an output of '='. However, according to the problem description, "0000" and "0000" should be treated as equal, but the handling of empty strings is not explicitly stated in the program, which can lead to confusion about how the outputs are determined.

3. **Output Constraints**: The program does not specify that it will handle the upper limit of input sizes, where input can be up to 10^6 digits. While Python can handle large integers, using `input()` alone without any buffering or optimized input methods for large data sets could be inefficient as suggested in the problem description.

4. **Unclear Output on Leading Zeros**: The program relies solely on lexicographical comparison after stripping leading zeros. While this works in most cases, if the entire strings are composed of leading zeros, it could lead to an unexpected result.

In summary, the program does not correctly handle cases where both inputs consist of only leading zeros and fails to properly manage comparisons under these conditions. Therefore, it does not entirely fulfill the problem requirements.
