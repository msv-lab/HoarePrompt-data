The value of `b` is assigned the string `'0'`, which is a specific value. Before this assignment, `b` was an empty string. The other variables remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, and if `a` is '0', then `b` is '0'; `data` remains a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace; current value of `b` is '0'.**
