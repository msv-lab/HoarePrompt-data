Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, if `a` is '0', then `b` is '0'; `data` remains a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace, and the current value of `b` is '0'. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. If `a` is less than `b`, then `a` is confirmed to be less than `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, then `a` is confirmed to be greater than `b`. Otherwise, if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the output printed is '='.***
