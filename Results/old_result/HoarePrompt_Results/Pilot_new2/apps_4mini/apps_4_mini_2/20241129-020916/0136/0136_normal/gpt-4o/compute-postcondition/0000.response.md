The variable `data` is assigned the result of `input().split()`, which will take user input, split it into components based on whitespace, and store those components in the list `data`. The variables `a` and `b`, which are strings representing non-negative integers, remain unchanged in terms of their values but are now potentially separate from the input data, assuming the input contains them. 

Output State: **`a` and `b` are two non-negative integers represented as strings, which may contain leading zeroes, `data` is a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace.**
