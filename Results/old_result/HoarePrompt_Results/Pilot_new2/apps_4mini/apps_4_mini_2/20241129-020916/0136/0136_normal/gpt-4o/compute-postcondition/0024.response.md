Postcondition: ***`a` is the string representation of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, if `a` is '0', then `b` is '0'; `data` remains a list of strings containing the input split by whitespace, and the current value of `b` is '0'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the printed output is '>'. If the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, then if `a` is less than `b`, it is confirmed that `a` is less than `b`; if `a` is greater than `b`, it is confirmed that `a` is greater than `b`; otherwise, if `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the printed output is '='.***
