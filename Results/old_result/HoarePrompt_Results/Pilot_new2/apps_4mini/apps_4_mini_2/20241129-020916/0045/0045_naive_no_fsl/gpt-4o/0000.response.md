To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic implemented in the function `func_1`.

The requirements specify that we need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n` and have the maximum greatest common divisor (GCD).

### Key Points to Consider:

1. **Minimum Sum Requirement**:
   - The minimum sum for a strictly increasing sequence of `k` integers (1, 2, ..., k) is given by `min_sum = k * (k + 1) / 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program correctly returns `-1`, as it is impossible to form such a sequence.

2. **Finding the Sequence**:
   - The program calculates `d = n // min_sum`, which is a potential GCD candidate. 
   - It then creates a sequence by multiplying each integer in the range `1` to `k` by `d`, resulting in `sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`.
   - If there is any remaining sum (`remainder = n - d * min_sum`), the program attempts to distribute this remainder among the elements of the sequence by incrementing the last elements of the sequence. 

3. **Strictly Increasing Requirement**:
   - The sequence generated is strictly increasing as long as the initial condition (`min_sum > n`) is not violated and the increments to the last elements do not violate the strictly increasing condition. Since the last elements can only be incremented after ensuring the base sequence is valid, this should hold.

### Potential Edge Cases:

- **Edge Case for Minimum Inputs**: 
  - For the minimum input values (n=1, k=1), the output should ideally be `1`, which the current implementation handles correctly.
  
- **Edge Case for Large n and k**: 
  - Consider n=10^10 and k=2. The minimum sum `min_sum` is `3` (1+2). The program correctly calculates `d` and generates `[5000000000, 10000000000]` as `sequence`. This is a valid strictly increasing sequence summing to `10^10`.

### Testing with Additional Cases:
- Let's consider `n = 10` and `k = 5`. The minimum sum required is `1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 = 15`, which is greater than `10`, so the output should be `-1`, which is also handled correctly.

Given these points, the function appears to correctly implement the logic for generating a strictly increasing sequence of `k` numbers that add up to `n` while maximizing the GCD. 

### Conclusion:
After reviewing the logic against the problem description and considering potential edge cases, the program handles all scenarios as expected. 

Correctness: **True**
