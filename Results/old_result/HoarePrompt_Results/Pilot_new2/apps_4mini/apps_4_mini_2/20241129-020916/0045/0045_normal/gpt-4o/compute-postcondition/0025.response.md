The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers constrained by the conditions that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In terms of output:
- Case_1: If the calculated value of `min_sum` (which is equal to k * (k + 1) // 2) is greater than `n`, the function returns -1.
- Case_2: If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function returns a sequence defined as [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)], where `d` is calculated as n // min_sum.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`. It checks if a certain minimum sum value is greater than `n`, returning -1 if it is; otherwise, it calculates a sequence based on the values of `n`, `k`, and the computed minimum sum. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and k, and returns -1 if the minimum sum is greater than n; otherwise, it returns a sequence based on n and k.**
