Correctness: **False**.

The program does not account for creating a strictly increasing sequence with a maximal greatest common divisor (GCD). For example, consider the input `n = 8` and `k = 2`. The program produces the sequence `1 7`, which is increasing, but does not maximize the GCD. The correct output should be `2 6`, which has a GCD of 2. 

Additionally, the program does not check whether the sum of the generated sequence can achieve the maximal GCD condition, which is a critical aspect of the problem statement. Therefore, for the input `n = 8` and `k = 2`, the program gives an incorrect and suboptimal result.
