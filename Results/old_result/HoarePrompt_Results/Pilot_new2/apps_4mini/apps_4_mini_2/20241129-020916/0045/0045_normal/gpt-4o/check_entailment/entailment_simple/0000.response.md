To analyze the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the functionality of the program and see if it meets the requirements specified.

### Problem Requirements:
1. The program must generate a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of this sequence should be maximized.
3. If it’s not possible to create such a sequence, the program should return -1.

### Program Breakdown:
1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**: 
   - The program calculates `min_sum` as the sum of the first `k` positive integers: `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`. This is the minimum sum required for a strictly increasing sequence of `k` integers.
   - If `min_sum > n`, it returns -1, which is correct per the problem statement.

2. **Finding the Sequence**:
   - The program then calculates `d`, the maximum GCD that can be used for the sequence, as `d = n // min_sum`.
   - It initializes the sequence to `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`. This generates the initial sequence as `[d, 2d, ..., kd]`.

3. **Distributing the Remainder**:
   - The program calculates the `remainder` as `n - d * min_sum`.
   - It attempts to distribute this `remainder` across the sequence to keep it strictly increasing. This is done by incrementing the last elements of the sequence until the remainder is exhausted.

### Evaluation of Correctness:
- **Strictly Increasing**: The construction of the sequence using `d * (i + 1)` guarantees that it starts as strictly increasing. The subsequent incrementation maintains this property since we are always adding to the last elements, which are already larger than the earlier ones.
  
- **Sum Equals `n`**: The initial sum of the sequence is `d * min_sum`, and by distributing the `remainder`, the final sum will be exactly `n`.

- **Maximal GCD**: Since `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, it indeed represents the maximum GCD for the sequence formed, ensuring that all elements are divisible by `d`.

- **Handling Impossible Cases**: The program correctly identifies when it’s not possible to create a valid sequence and returns -1 in those cases.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to all aspects of the problem description. It constructs the required sequence while ensuring the conditions of strict increase, sum, and maximal GCD.

**Correctness: True**
