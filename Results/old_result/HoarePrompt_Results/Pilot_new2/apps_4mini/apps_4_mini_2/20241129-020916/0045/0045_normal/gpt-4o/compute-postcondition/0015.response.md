Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10 and `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n; d` is equal to `n // min_sum; remainder` is `previous_value - 1`; `sequence` is equal to `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k - 2)] + [d * k + 1]; `i` is `k - 2`, and if `remainder` equals 0, the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
