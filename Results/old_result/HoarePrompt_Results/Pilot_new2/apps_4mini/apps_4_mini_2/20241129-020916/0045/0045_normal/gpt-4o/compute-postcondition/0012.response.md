In the provided code snippet, `remainder` is decremented by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. The initial state gives us the information that `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, and `sequence` have specific relationships but does not provide concrete values for them. Thus, we only adjust `remainder` by subtracting 1. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2` and is less than or equal to `n; d` is equal to `n // min_sum; remainder` is `previous_value - 1`; `sequence` is equal to `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k - 1)] + [d * k + 1]; `i` is `k - 1`.**
