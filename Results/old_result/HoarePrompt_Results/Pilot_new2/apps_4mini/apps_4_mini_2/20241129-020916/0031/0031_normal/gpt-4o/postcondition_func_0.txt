The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function utilizes the Euclidean algorithm to compute the GCD. Since `b` can be reduced to zero, the algorithm will always terminate correctly. The function does not handle input validation, but it assumes that both parameters `a` and `b` are within the expected ranges.
