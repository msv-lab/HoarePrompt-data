The expression `denominator //= gcd` divides the variable `denominator` by `gcd` using integer division and assigns the result back to `denominator`. The previous states of the affected variables are `denominator` (which can be 4 for `k` equal to 2, 8 for `k` equal to 3, or greater for `k` greater than 3) and `gcd` (which is either 2 for `k` equal to 2, 8 for `k` equal to 3, or equal to `denominator` for `k` greater than 3).

1. If `k` is 2:
   - `denominator` is 4 and `gcd` is 2.
   - The new value of `denominator` will be `4 // 2`, which equals 2.

2. If `k` is 3:
   - `denominator` is 8 and `gcd` is 8.
   - The new value of `denominator` will be `8 // 8`, which equals 1.

3. If `k` is greater than 3:
   - The value of `denominator` is greater than 8 and `gcd` equals `denominator`.
   - The new value of `denominator` will be `denominator // denominator`, which equals 1.

Thus, depending on the value of `k`, the output state will reflect the updated value of `denominator`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`; `k` is an integer such that `k ≥ 2`; `total_days` is 2; `numerator` is either 1 (if `k` is 2) or 0 (if `k ≥ 3); `denominator` is 2 (if `k` is 2), 1 (if `k` is 3), or 1 (if `k > 3); `gcd` is either 2 (if `k` is 2), 8 (if `k` is 3), or equal to `denominator` (if `k > 3`.**
