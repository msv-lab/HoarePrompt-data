To evaluate the correctness of the given Python program, we will analyze the problem description, the program logic, and the provided output hints.

### Problem Description:
The problem involves calculating the probability that at least two people among `k` interviewed have the same birthday in a year with `2^n` days. The output should be the probability in the form of an irreducible fraction \(\frac{A}{B}\), where `A` and `B` are coprime, printed modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

### Program Analysis:
The program defines a function `func_1(n, k)` that computes the numerator and denominator for the probability based on the provided logic. Here are the main points of consideration:

1. **Birthday Problem Logic**: The logic used to calculate the numerator and denominator is based on the formula for the probability of no shared birthdays, and then it should compute the complementary probability for at least one shared birthday. However, the current implementation seems to compute the numerator for the no-collision case rather than directly calculating the probability of at least one collision.
   
2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `k > total_days` (i.e., \(k > 2^n\)), it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday, and thus the output should be \(1, 1\).
   - The logic needs to handle large values of `n` and `k` properly. The current implementation does not seem to account for the case where \(k\) exceeds \(2^n\) before calculations begin. 

3. **GCD Calculation**: The program computes the GCD of the numerator and denominator to ensure the fraction is in its simplest form, which is correct.

### Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints suggest that the function calculates the number of ways to choose `k` items from `2^n` items and that the results are simplified modulo \(10^6 + 3\). They also mention the issue of the numerator being zero when \(k\) is larger than `total_days`, which would affect the output.

### Conclusion:
The implementation does not handle the case where \(k > 2^n\) properly, and it may not output \(1, 1\) in such cases as required. 

Additionally, the output hints confirm that the program does not correctly calculate and return probabilities in all potential cases, particularly for edge cases where \(k\) exceeds `total_days`.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle cases where \(k\) is greater than \(2^n\) properly, which is a critical scenario as defined in the problem description.
