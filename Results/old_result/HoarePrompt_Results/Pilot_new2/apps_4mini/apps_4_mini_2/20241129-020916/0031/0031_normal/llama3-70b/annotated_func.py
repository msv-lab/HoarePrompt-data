#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
def func_1(n, k):
    total_days = 2 ** n
    numerator = 1
    denominator = 1
    for i in range(k):
        numerator *= total_days - i
        
        denominator *= total_days
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is an integer such that `k ≥ 2`, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2 if `k` is 2, or 0 if `k > 2, `denominator` is 4 if `k` is 2, or 8 if `k` is 3, and continues to grow for `k > 3.`
    gcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)
    numerator //= gcd
    denominator //= gcd
    return numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3), denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)
    #The program returns numerator modulo (10
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters, `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. It calculates the number of ways to choose `k` items from `2^n` total items, returning the simplified numerator and denominator of that fraction, both modulo `10^6 + 3`. If `k` is larger than `total_days`, the numerator may become zero, affecting the output.
