The provided program seems to be implementing the logic required to calculate the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday given `2^n` days in a year and `k` people. Let's break down the functionality of the program in comparison with the problem description.

1. **Input Constraints**: 
   - The program expects inputs `n` and `k` where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`, which matches the constraints given in the problem description.

2. **Handling the Case Where k > 2^n**:
   - The program checks if `k` exceeds `2^n`. If this is true, it immediately outputs `1 1`, which corresponds to the scenario where it's guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday. This is correctly handled according to the problem statement.

3. **Calculating the Total Days**:
   - It correctly calculates `total_days` as `1 << n` (which is equivalent to `2^n`).

4. **Numerator and Denominator Calculation**:
   - The program computes:
     - `numerator`: Product of available days for each person in the interview (`(2^n - 0) * (2^n - 1) * ... * (2^n - (k - 1))`).
     - `denominator`: Total combinations of birthdays (`(2^n)^k`).
   - Both are calculated modulo `10^6 + 3`, adhering to the requirements of the problem.

5. **Probability of Shared Birthdays**:
   - It correctly calculates the probability of at least two shared birthdays as:
     - `p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared) % MOD`.

6. **Reduction of the Fraction**:
   - The program reduces `A` and `B` using their greatest common divisor (GCD) returned by `func_1`, ensuring that the output is in irreducible form.
   - It handles the modulo operation on `A` and `B` correctly after reduction, ensuring the final output fits within the specified constraints.

7. **Output**:
   - Finally, the program prints `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`, which is consistent with the requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion
The program implements the required calculations accurately and handles edge cases effectively. It adheres to the constraints and requirements laid out in the problem description, ensuring that it will produce the correct outputs for all valid inputs.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is confirmed.

Correctness: **True**
