The code assigns the value `1` to `denominator`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`, `total_days` is equal to `2`, `numerator` is equal to `1`, and `denominator` is equal to `1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`, `total_days` is equal to `2`, `numerator` is equal to `1`, `denominator` is equal to `1`.**
