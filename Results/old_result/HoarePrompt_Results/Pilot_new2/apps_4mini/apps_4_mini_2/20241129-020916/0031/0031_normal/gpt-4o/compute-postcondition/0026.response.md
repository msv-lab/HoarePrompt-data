To provide the output state, we analyze the given code and the initial state step by step.

1. The initial state provides various variables, including `n`, `k`, `MOD`, and others.
2. The code snippet includes a `print` statement that outputs the values of `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`.
3. The values of `A` and `B` are not defined explicitly in the task description, but they are influenced by the operations performed in the previous lines not captured in the given code.
4. After running the code, the values of `A` and `B` will be displayed in the output, taking into account that both will be taken modulo `MOD`.
5. We assume `A` is modified in the previous operations but not quantified here.

Based on this reasoning, we provide the output state while indicating that `A` and `B` will be given in a modular context.

Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to 2^n; `numerator` is (2^n) × (2^n - 1) × (2^n - 2) × ... × (2^n - (k - 1)) mod 1000003; `denominator` is (2^n)^k mod 1000003; `p_no_shared` is equal to the value of numerator; `p_total` is (2^n)^k mod 1000003; `p_shared` is (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) mod MOD; `A` is updated to A // g; `B` is equal to (2^n)^k mod 1000003; `g` is assigned the value returned by func_1(A, B); `B` is updated to B // g; `print` outputs (A % MOD) and (B % MOD).**
