To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the functionality of the annotated program and compare it with the requirements specified in the problem.

### Problem Analysis
1. **Birthday Paradox Context**: The problem requires calculating the probability of at least two individuals sharing a birthday among `k` individuals in a year with `2^n` days.
2. **Output Requirements**: The probability must be expressed as an irreducible fraction `A/B`, where `A` and `B` must be coprime and returned modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Program Functionality
- The program begins by defining the total number of days in Udayland as `2^n`.
- It initializes a `numerator` and `denominator` to compute the probability.
- The `for` loop iterates over `k` individuals:
  - For each person `i`, it computes:
    - `numerator` as the product of available days (total_days - i).
    - `denominator` simply as the total number of days raised to the power of `k` (which is `total_days` multiplied by itself `k` times).
- After exiting the loop, the program calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `numerator` and `denominator` to reduce the fraction to its irreducible form.
- Finally, it returns both `A` and `B` modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Correctness Evaluation
1. **Numerator and Denominator Calculation**:
   - The numerator effectively counts the number of ways to assign unique birthdays to `k` people.
   - The denominator counts the total possible birthday assignments without restriction (each person can have any of the `2^n` days).
   - The formula used in the loop correctly implements the logic of the Birthday Paradox.
  
2. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - When `k > total_days`, the program will still correctly yield a numerator of `1` (indicating at least one pair shares a birthday) and denominator of `1`, resulting in the output of `1 1` for such cases.
   - The program correctly finds the gcd and ensures the output fraction is irreducible.

3. **Modulo Operation**:
   - The program applies the modulo operation correctly to the final results, ensuring that both `A` and `B` are within bounds as required.

### Conclusion
The program accurately calculates the required probability according to the problem specifications. It correctly handles edge cases, reduces fractions when necessary, and provides output modulo `10^6 + 3`.

Thus, the program adheres to the requirements stated in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
