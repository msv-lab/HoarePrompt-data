Output State: **`n` is an integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer where 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to 2^n; `numerator` is (2^n) × (2^n - 1) × (2^n - 2) × ... × (2^n - (k - 1)) mod 1000003; `denominator` is (2^n)^k mod 1000003; `p_no_shared` is equal to the value of numerator; `p_total` is (2^n)^k mod 1000003; `p_shared` is (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) mod MOD; `A` is updated to A // g; `B` is equal to (2^n)^k mod 1000003; `g` is assigned the value returned by func_1(A, B); `B` is updated to B // g.**
