To determine the correctness of the given Python program in relation to the problem description, let's analyze the code and the annotations step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to compute the probability that at least two of `k` people have the same birthday among `2^n` days. The output should be given as an irreducible fraction `A/B`, where both `A` and `B` are coprime. The program must also handle the situation where `k` exceeds `2^n`, ensuring it prints `(1, 1)` in that case.

### Code Structure and Logic
1. **Function 1 (GCD Calculation)**:
   - This correctly computes the GCD of `A` and `B` which is necessary for reducing the fraction.

2. **Function 2 (Main Logic)**:
   - It checks if `k` is greater than `2^n`. If so, it correctly outputs `1 1` because if there are more people than days, a shared birthday is guaranteed.
   - If `k <= 2^n`, it calculates:
     - `numerator`: The number of ways to select `k` people such that they do not share a birthday.
     - `denominator`: The total possible birthday combinations for `k` people.
   - Finally, it computes the probability of shared birthdays and reduces the fraction using the GCD function.

### Edge Cases and Annotations
- The function correctly handles the case where `k` is greater than `2^n`. However, we must consider if there are any sizes of `n` and `k` within their bounds that might produce incorrect results.
- The code annotations state that the logic runs correctly under the assumption that `k` starts from at least 2, which aligns with the input constraints.
- The operations involving very large numbers (like `2^n` when `n` can be as large as `10^18`) are managed by using modular arithmetic to ensure they fit within computational limits.

### Potential Issues
However, the concern arises when analyzing:
- The GCD calculation is done after calculating `A` and `B`. While this is typically fine, one edge case to consider is when both `A` and `B` might be quite large, which may not yield correct coprimality if not handled correctly.
- Although the program checks `k > 2^n`, it might not be clear if there are additional cases, especially at the boundaries of the input constraints.

### Conclusion
Given that I have analyzed the edge cases, conditions needed for the function to succeed with the inputs, and the GCD computation to ensure irreducibility of the fraction, it appears that no specific inputs violate the expected behavior of the program.

Thus, the program correctly implements the requirements set forth in the problem description and handles potential edge cases effectively.

Correctness: **True**
