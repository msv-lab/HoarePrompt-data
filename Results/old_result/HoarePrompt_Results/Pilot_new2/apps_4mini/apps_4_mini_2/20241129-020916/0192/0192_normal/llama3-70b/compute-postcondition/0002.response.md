The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the absence of parameters in its definition. However, it operates based on the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers, with the conditions that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function returns a value based on these integer constraints.

Since there is no explicit output description provided for the function, we cannot determine the exact return value or any conditions that apply to it beyond the constraints on `x` and `y`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function is not completely clear without additional information about the output.

Functionality: **The function operates under the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but does not accept parameters or provide an explicit output description.**
