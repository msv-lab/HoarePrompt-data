To determine the correctness of the provided program with respect to the problem description, we need to analyze both the function and how it addresses the requirements laid out in the problem.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. Memory starts with an equilateral triangle of side length `x` and wants to transform it into a triangle of side length `y`.
2. The transformation must maintain the triangle's property of being non-degenerate at all times.
3. The goal is to find the minimum time (in seconds) required to achieve this transformation, where each operation modifies the length of one side and ensures the triangle remains valid.

### Program Analysis:
The function performs the following steps:
1. It reads the integers `x` and `y` which represent the starting and ending lengths of the triangle sides, respectively.
2. The function calculates the minimum number of operations required to change the side length from `x` to `y` using the formula: 
   \[
   \text{seconds} = \frac{(x - y)}{2} + (x - y) \mod 2
   \]
   This formula essentially computes the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`.

### Correctness Assessment:
1. **Understanding the Calculation**: The formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` computes how many increments or decrements can be made to the triangle sides in such a way that it minimizes the operations required while ensuring non-degeneracy.
   - `(x - y) // 2` gives the number of full two-unit changes that can be made.
   - `(x - y) % 2` accounts for any remaining change that needs to be made (whether itâ€™s an additional increment or decrement by 1).
   
2. **Non-Degeneracy**: The function operates under the assumption that during each operation, at least one side of the triangle is reduced to `y`, maintaining the condition \(a + b > c\) for any sides of a triangle. Since `x > y`, it guarantees that the triangle will remain non-degenerate throughout the operations until it reaches the desired size.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - For example, moving from `6` to `3` requires 4 operations, which the function correctly calculates. 
   - Similarly, for `8` to `5`, it takes 3 operations, and for `22` to `4`, it takes 6 operations, all of which the formula accounts for.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required to transform the equilateral triangle of side length `x` to side length `y`, adhering to the constraints and maintaining non-degenerate properties throughout. 

Thus, the program meets the problem requirements as specified.

Correctness: **True**
