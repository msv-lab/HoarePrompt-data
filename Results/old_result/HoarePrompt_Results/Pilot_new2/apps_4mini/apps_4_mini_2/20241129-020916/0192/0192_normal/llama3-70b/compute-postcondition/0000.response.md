The variables `x` and `y` are assigned new values from the input. Since the initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, after the `map(int, input().split())` operation, `x` and `y` will now hold the specific integer values input by the user. The states of other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`x` is input integer, `y` is input integer such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000.**
