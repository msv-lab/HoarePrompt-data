Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range (1 <= n <= 30 and n > 1), `m` is an integer within the range (1 <= m <= 30), `i` is the next integer greater than its previous value. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `r` is updated to `r % s[i]` and `shares` is updated to `shares + (r // s[i])`. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
