Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is greater than 0, `r` is an integer (1 <= r <= 1000) that remains less than all elements of `s`, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000), `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in descending order, and `shares` is 0, `i` is 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated to `r + shares * b[i]`, while still being less than all elements of `s`. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the program simply breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, maintaining the initial conditions of the variables.***
