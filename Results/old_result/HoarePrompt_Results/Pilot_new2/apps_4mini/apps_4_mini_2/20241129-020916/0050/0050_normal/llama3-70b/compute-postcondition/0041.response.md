Output State: **`n` is an integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an integer (1 <= r <= 1000) that is less than all elements of `s`, `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers (1 <= s[i] <= 1000), `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, and `i` is equal to `m`. After all iterations, `r` remains less than all elements of `s`, as `shares` was never greater than 0 to update `r`.**
