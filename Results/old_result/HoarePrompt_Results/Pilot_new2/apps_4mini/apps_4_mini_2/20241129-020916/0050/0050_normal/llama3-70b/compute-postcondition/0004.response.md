The list `b` is sorted in reverse order, meaning the elements will now be arranged from largest to smallest. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged, but `b` has been altered. The previous values of `b` are not known, but we know it will now contain the same integers sorted in descending order.

Output State: **`n` is an integer based on input (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an integer based on input (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an integer based on input (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers based on input (1 <= s[i] <= 1000), `b` is now a list of `m` integers sorted in descending order.**
