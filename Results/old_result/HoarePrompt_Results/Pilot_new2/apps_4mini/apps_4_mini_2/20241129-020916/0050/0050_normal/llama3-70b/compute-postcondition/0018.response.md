According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. Since `n` is already established as being greater than 1 and within the range of 1 to 30, the loop's execution depends on the current value of `i`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, we have `n` (which is still within the specified range), and we know that `i` must be updated to move to the next iteration. Specifically, `i` would be incremented by 1 for the next iteration of the loop.

Therefore, if `i` is currently less than `n`, it will increment by 1 to prepare for the next iteration, leading to the following state:

State: **`n` is an integer within the ranges (1 <= n <= 30 and n > 1), `m` is an integer within the range (1 <= m <= 30), `i` is the next integer greater than its previous value**
