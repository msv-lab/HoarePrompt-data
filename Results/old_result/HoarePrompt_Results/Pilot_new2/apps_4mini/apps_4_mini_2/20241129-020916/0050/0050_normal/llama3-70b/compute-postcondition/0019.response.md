To analyze the given code snippet, we need to understand its impact on the state of the variables based on the initial conditions provided.

Initial State: `n` is an integer within the ranges (1 <= n <= 30 and n > 1), `m` is an integer within the range (1 <= m <= 30), `i` is the next integer greater than its previous value.

The code snippet provided is:
```
shares += r // s[i]
```

1. The variable `shares` is incremented by the result of `r // s[i]`, which means `shares` will now hold its previous value plus the integer division of `r` by the `i`-th element of the list `s`. 
2. The values of `n`, `m`, `i`, `r`, and `s` are not directly modified by this operation, but `shares` is affected.

Given that:
- `i` is the next integer greater than its previous value, meaning it is at least 2 (if we assume it started from 1) and can be up to 30 depending on the context of the loop or range it is in.
- We do not know the exact values of `r` or `s`, but we assume `s` is a list or array that contains valid integers for the range of indices specified by `i`.

Since we haven't defined specific values for `shares`, `r`, or `s`, we can only state the general conditions:

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the ranges (1 <= n <= 30 and n > 1), `m` is an integer within the range (1 <= m <= 30), `i` is the next integer greater than its previous value, `shares` is updated to `shares + (r // s[i])`.**
