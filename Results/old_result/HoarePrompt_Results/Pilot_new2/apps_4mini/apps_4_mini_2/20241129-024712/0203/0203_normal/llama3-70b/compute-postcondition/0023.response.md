Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is the count of 'D' in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' in `fractions`, and `fractions` is a non-empty string of 'D' and 'R'. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, then the condition holds true, otherwise, `depublicans` is less than or equal to `remocrats`.***
