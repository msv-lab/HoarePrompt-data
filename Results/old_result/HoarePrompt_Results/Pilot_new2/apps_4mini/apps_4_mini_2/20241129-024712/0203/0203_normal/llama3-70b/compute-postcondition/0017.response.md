Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string of 'D' and 'R' with at least 3 characters. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1, and `remocrats` is adjusted appropriately based on the second character of `fractions`. Otherwise, `depublicans` is adjusted appropriately based on the second character of `fractions`, and `remocrats` is increased by 1.***
