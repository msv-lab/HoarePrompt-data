Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` contains its previous elements plus the value `d_index + n`, and `r_queue` is one element shorter with `r_index` being the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it was removed. Otherwise, `d_queue` contains the elements after removing the first element, while `r_queue` now contains an additional element equal to `r_index + n`, and `r_queue` is one element shorter with `r_index` being the value of the first element of `r_queue` before it was removed.***
