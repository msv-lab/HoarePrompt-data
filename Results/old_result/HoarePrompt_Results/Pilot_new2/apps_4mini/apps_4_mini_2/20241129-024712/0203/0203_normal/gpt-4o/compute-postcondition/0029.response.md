The variable `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element removed from `r_queue`, which affects the `r_queue`. The state of `n`, `votes`, `d_queue`, and `d_index` remains unchanged. However, since an element is removed from `r_queue`, it will now contain one less element.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `d_queue` contains one less index; `r_queue` contains one less index; `d_index` is the value of the first element removed from `d_queue`; `r_index` is the first element removed from `r_queue`.**
