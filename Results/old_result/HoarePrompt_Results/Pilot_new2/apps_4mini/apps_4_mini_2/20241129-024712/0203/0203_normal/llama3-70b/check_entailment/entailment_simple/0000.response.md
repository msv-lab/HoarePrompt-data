The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. 

### Explanation of the Issue:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: The problem describes a voting scenario where employees can deny others the right to vote, and this continues until only one employee remains who then determines the outcome. The outcome is not simply based on counting the number of 'D' and 'R' at the beginning of the voting process but rather on how these employees interact and deny each other.

2. **Program Logic**: The program counts the number of 'D' and 'R' employees and immediately determines the outcome based solely on the initial counts:
   - If `depublicans > remocrats`, it prints 'D'.
   - Otherwise, it prints 'R'.

3. **Incorrect Assumption**: This approach assumes that the winner can be determined just by counting the fractions at the start without considering the voting dynamics and denial process described in the problem. For example, in a situation where the remocrats (R) can effectively deny enough depublicans (D) from voting in the subsequent rounds, the program would still incorrectly print 'D' if there are more 'D's initially.

### Counterexample:

Consider the input:
```
5
DDRRR
```
The optimal strategy for the depublicans would be to deny the remocrats one by one, as shown in the problem description. The last remaining member would be a depublican, resulting in 'D' as the output. 

However, if there were different counts like:
```
6
DDRRRR
```
The remocrats could dominate the ability to deny votes, and through optimal play, they would end up winning, which the current program logic fails to account for.

### Conclusion:

The logic of the program is flawed because it fails to model the voting and denial process as described. It assumes that simply counting the characters is sufficient to predict the outcome, which is incorrect according to the specified problem dynamics.

Thus, the correctness of the given program is:

Correctness: **False**
