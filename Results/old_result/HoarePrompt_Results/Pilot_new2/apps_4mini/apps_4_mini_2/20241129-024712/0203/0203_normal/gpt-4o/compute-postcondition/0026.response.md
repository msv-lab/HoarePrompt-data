Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` includes `d_index + n` and `r_queue` contains one less index. Otherwise, `r_queue` includes an additional index equal to `r_index + n` while `d_queue` remains unchanged. In both cases, `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue` before the pop operation, and `r_index` is the first element of `r_queue` before the pop.***
