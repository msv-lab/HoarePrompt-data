The code provided is a print statement that outputs the character 'R'. There are no changes to the state of the variables `d_queue` and `r_queue`, as they are not affected by this operation.

Since the initial state indicates that `d_queue` is empty and `r_queue` may or may not be empty, we can conclude that the state of these queues remains unchanged after executing the print statement.

Output State: **`d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` may be empty, and 'R' has been printed.**
