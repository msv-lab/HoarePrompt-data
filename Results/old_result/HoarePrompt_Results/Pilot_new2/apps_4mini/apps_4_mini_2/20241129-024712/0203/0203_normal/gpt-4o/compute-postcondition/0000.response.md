The variable `n` is assigned the value from `int(input())`, which means it will take an input that is converted into an integer. The initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer in the range from 1 to 200,000. This condition remains valid since the input is expected to fall within this range.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000.**
