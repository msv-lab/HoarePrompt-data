The code appends the value of `i` to `r_queue`. The value of `i` is equal to the length of the `votes` string, which is a positive integer. The states of other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is equal to the length of `votes`, and `r_queue` now contains the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000; `votes` is a non-empty string; `i` is equal to the length of `votes`; `r_queue` contains the value of `i`.**
