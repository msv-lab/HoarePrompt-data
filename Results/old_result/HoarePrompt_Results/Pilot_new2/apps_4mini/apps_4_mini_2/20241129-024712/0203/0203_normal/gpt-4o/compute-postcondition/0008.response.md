The `r_queue` is updated by appending the current value of `i`, which is 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is a list containing the value [0], `i` is 0, `v` is the first character of `votes`, and `v` is not equal to 'D'.
