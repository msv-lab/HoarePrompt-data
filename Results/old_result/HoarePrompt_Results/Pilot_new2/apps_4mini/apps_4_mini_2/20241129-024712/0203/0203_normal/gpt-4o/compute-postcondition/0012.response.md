The code `r_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list `r_queue`. The variable `i` is the length of the string `votes`, which is a non-empty string. Therefore, `i` will have a value greater than or equal to 1. The output state will reflect the updated state of the variable `r_queue`, which now includes the value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `i` is the length of `votes`, `r_queue` includes the length of `votes`**.
