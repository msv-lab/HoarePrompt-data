The value of `m` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value from 3 to 4. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a[i]` is not equal to double `a[i - 1]`, `m` is 4, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2.

Output State: **`a[i]` is not equal to double `a[i - 1]`, `m` is 4, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than 2**
