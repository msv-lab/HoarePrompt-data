The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables remain unchanged in their values or conditions. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `assigned` contains elements, `can_form` is True, and the value of `a[i] - x` is an element of `assigned`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `assigned` contains elements, `can_form` is True, and the value of `a[i] - x` is an element of `assigned`.**
