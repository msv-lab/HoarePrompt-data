The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It counts and returns the number of elements in `a` that cannot be formed as differences of previously assigned integers from the sorted list. Elements that can be formed from such differences will not contribute to the count. The function ensures that all integers in `a` are considered, and the count reflects only those that are not representable as differences of any two previously assigned integers.
