According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and continues until `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is at least 2, and since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again. 

To execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it must become at least 3. For the loop to run again, `n` must be greater than 3. 

Thus, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` will be increased to at least 3.
- `n` must be greater than 3.

State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `i` is at least 3, `assigned` still contains elements from `a` corresponding to indices less than `i`, and `assigned` will include the element `a[i]`**
