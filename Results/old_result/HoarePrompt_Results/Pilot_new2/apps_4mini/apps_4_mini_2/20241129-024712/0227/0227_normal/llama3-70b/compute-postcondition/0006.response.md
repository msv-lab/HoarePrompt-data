The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is 1, so after the execution, `m` will be 2. The states of the other variables remain the same since they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `m` is 2, and the current value of `a[i]` is not equal to double the previous element `a[i - 1]`.**
