The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `assigned` contains at least 2 elements, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True, and `x` is `assigned[1]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
