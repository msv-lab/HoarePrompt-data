The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly as per the provided code, indicating that it might rely on external variables or a different method of receiving input. However, the constraints specify that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers with values ranging from 1 to 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers where their values lie between 1 and the product of `n`, `m`, and `k`, with the condition that `a` is not equal to `b`.

Given these constraints, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly but operates based on the external integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, a ≠ b), and it performs some operations based on these values.**
