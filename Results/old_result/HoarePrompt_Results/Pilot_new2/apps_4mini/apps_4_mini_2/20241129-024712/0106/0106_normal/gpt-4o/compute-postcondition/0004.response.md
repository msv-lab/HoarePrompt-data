The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. The parameter `apartment` is an integer such that 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k, with n, m, and k being integers constrained between 1 and 1000. The function calculates two values: `block` and `floor`. The value of `block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and `floor` is calculated based on the value of `floor_within_block`, which is derived from the apartment number. The function returns the calculated values of `block` and `floor`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment and returns the values of 'block' and 'floor' based on the apartment number within a defined structure.**
