The code snippet provided calculates the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`. Since `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` are computed based on the values of `a_block`, `b_block`, `n`, `a_floor`, and `b_floor`, we need to consider the conditions that determine their values.

1. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`:
   - `min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.
   - `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`.

2. If `b_floor` is greater than or equal to `a_floor`:
   - `min_block_time` is the same: `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.
   - `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.

After executing the print statement, no values of the variables (`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `a_block`, `b_block`, `a_floor`, `b_floor`, `min_block_time`, `min_floor_time`) are changed, but the output will be the computed sum.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are user input integers; `a`, `b` are user input values; `min_block_time` is calculated based on the minimum of the absolute block differences; `min_floor_time` is calculated based on the differences of the floors. The output will be the value of `min_block_time + min_floor_time`.**
