To determine the output state after executing the code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the initial state:

1. We start with the variables defined:
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers (1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000).
   - `a` and `b` are distinct integers (1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k`).
   - `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on `get_location(a)`.
   - `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on `get_location(b)`.
   - If `floor_a` is 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, if `floor_a` is not equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is at least 11.
   - `direct_walk_time` is equal to `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.

2. The code modifies the variable `reverse_walk_time`:
   - `reverse_walk_time` is assigned the value of `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.

3. The calculation for `reverse_walk_time` involves the values of `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b`:
   - `abs(block_a - block_b)` is computed.
   - The result is subtracted from `n`, and then the modulo operation is applied with `n`.
   - Finally, the result is multiplied by 15 to calculate `reverse_walk_time`.

4. The value of `reverse_walk_time` is now defined but depends on the values of `n`, `block_a`, and `block_b`.

Now, we can summarize the Output State while keeping the initial conditions valid:

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on `get_location(b)`; if `floor_a` is 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise, if `floor_a` is not equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is at least 11; `direct_walk_time` is equal to `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; reverse_walk_time is equal to (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15.**
