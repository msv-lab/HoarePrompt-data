In the provided code, `a` and `b` are assigned new values based on user input using the `map` function, which converts the split string input into integers. The previous values of `a` and `b` are constrained such that they are distinct integers within the range defined by the product of `n`, `m`, and `k`. 

Since `a` and `b` are now being reassigned from user input, their previous values will be replaced. However, the constraints of the variables `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

The output state will reflect the new values of `a` and `b` based on user input. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned values based on user input; `a` is an integer equal to user input value 1, `b` is an integer equal to user input value 2, where 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k, 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k, and a ≠ b.**
