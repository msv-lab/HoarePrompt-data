Postcondition: ***`n` is the user input integer; `m` is the user input integer; `k` is the user input integer; `a` is the user input value 1; `b` is the user input value 2; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1; a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is equal to `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is equal to `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; and `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`.***
