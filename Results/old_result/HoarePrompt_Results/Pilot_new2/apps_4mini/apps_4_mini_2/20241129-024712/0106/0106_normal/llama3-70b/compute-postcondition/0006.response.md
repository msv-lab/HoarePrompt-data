To derive the output state, we can follow the steps outlined:

1. The variables `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are integers based on user input. 
2. `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`, which gives the floor of `a` in terms of `m`.
3. `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, which gives the block number of `a` based on `m` and `k`.
4. `b_floor` is calculated similarly as `(b - 1) % m + 1`.
5. `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
6. The code calculates `min_block_time` using the formula `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.

Given this logic, the variables `min_block_time`, `a_block`, and `b_block` are the ones that will change as a result of the executed code.

The values of `a_block` and `b_block` are derived from the initial values of `a` and `b`. The absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` is calculated, and the minimum is taken either from this difference or the difference subtracted from `n`.

Therefore, after the execution of the code, the output state will reflect the calculated values as follows:

Output State: **`n` is the user input integer; `m` is the user input integer; `k` is the user input integer; `a` is the user input value 1; `b` is the user input value 2; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1; `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1; `b_block` is equal to `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1; `min_block_time` is equal to `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.**
