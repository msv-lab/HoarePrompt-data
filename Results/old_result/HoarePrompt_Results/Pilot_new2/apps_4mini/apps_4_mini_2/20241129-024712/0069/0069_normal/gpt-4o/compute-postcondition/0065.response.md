Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 1, `index` is at least 3, `s` is a valid string, `prefix_balances` is a list of length at least 2, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 1, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`, and if `x` satisfies the conditions that (x - b) is divisible by `balance` and (x - b) divided by `balance` is greater than or equal to 0, then the conditions hold true. Otherwise, the variable states remain unchanged.***
