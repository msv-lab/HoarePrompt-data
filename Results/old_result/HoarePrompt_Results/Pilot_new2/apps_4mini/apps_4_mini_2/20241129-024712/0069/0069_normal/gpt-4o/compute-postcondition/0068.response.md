Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 1, `index` is 4, `s` is a valid string, `prefix_balances` is a list of length at least 2, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is either 2 (if `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`) or remains 1 (if the condition is not met), and `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`. If `x` satisfies the conditions, the variables are updated accordingly; otherwise, the variable states remain unchanged.***
