The statement `print(result)` outputs the current value of `result`, which is the next element in `results`. The other variables are not modified by this print statement. Therefore, the output state retains all previous values of the other variables.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `results` must contain at least 2 elements, `index` is `3 * T + 2`, `balance` is calculated based on the last iteration's counts of '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, and `result` is the next element in `results`.**
