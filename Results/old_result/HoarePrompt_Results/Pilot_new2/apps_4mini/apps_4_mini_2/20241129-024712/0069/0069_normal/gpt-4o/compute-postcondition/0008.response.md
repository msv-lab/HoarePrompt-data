The variable `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The variable `index` is currently 1, so `index + 2` equals 3. Therefore, `s` will be set to the value at `data[3]`. The previous values of `T`, `n`, `x`, `data`, `index`, and `results` remain unchanged, as only the variable `s` is affected.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings from the input, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `s` is the value of `data[3]**.
