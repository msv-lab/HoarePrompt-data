In the provided code snippet, `n` and `x` are both assigned values from user input. The `map(int, input().split())` function reads a line of input, splits it into parts (presumably two integers), and converts those parts into integers, assigning them to `n` and `x`. The initial state indicates `n` is an input integer, and `x` is another input integer, but their specific values will be determined by the input during execution. 

The other variables remain unchanged as the code only affects `n` and `x`. The variables `T`, `_`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` retain their initial values.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `_` is equal to `T`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`**.
