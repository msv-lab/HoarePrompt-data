Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `_` is equal to `T`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, then `n + 1` is printed. Otherwise, if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the output is -1. If not, a value equal to `(x - (cnt0 - cnt1)) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is returned.***
