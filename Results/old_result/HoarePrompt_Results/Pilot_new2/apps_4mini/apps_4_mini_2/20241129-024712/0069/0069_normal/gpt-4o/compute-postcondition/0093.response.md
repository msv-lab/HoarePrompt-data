The code `results.append(0)` appends `0` to the `results` list. None of the other variables are affected by this operation, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is between 4 and 100, `n` is at least 0, `index` is valid (previous value + 3), `s` is data[index + 2] and valid, `x` is data[index + 1] and valid, `balance` is calculated from `s`, `prefix_balances` contains the prefix sums based on the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`, where `prefix_balances[n]` reflects the final balance after processing up to `n` characters of `s`, the current value of `balance` is 0, `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes an additional value of 0.**
