Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 1, `index` is 5, `s` is a valid string, `prefix_balances` is a list of length at least 5, `balance` is not equal to 0, and if `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is either 3 (if it was previously 2) or 2 (if it was previously 1); otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
