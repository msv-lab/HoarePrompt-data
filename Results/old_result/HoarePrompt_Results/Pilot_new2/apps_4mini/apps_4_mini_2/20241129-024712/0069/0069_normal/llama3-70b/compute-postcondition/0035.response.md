Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `n` is the input integer for the last test case, `x` is the input integer for the last test case, `s` is the input string for the last test case, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. For each test case, if `balance` equals `x`, then `n + 1` is printed. If `balance` does not equal `x` and `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, then -1 is printed; otherwise, the printed result is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. If no test cases are processed, `n`, `x`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` remain undefined.**
