The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and is updated according to the character in the string `s` at position `i - 1`. If `s[i - 1]` is '0', the update adds 1 to `prefix_balances[i - 1]`; otherwise, it subtracts 1. Since `i` is defined as `n + 1`, the new value of `prefix_balances[i]` will depend on the value of `prefix_balances[n]`.

The output state dictates that the rest of the preconditions remain valid, while `prefix_balances[i]` is now dependent on whether `s[n - 1]` is '0' or not.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` must be at least 4, `index` must be at least 3, `s` is a valid string, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[n] + 1 if s[n - 1] == '0' else prefix_balances[n] - 1, `i` is `n + 1`.**
