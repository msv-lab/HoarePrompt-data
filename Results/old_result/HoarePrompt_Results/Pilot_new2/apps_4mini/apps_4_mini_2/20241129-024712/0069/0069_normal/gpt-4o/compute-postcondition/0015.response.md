To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we analyze the initial state and the impact of the code.

Initial State: 
- `T` is between 1 and 100
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 2
- `i` is 2
- `prefix_balances[1]` is equal to `prefix_balances[0]` plus (1 if `s[0]` is '0' else -1)

The line of code updates `prefix_balances[i]` which is `prefix_balances[2]` in this case. The value is calculated based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]` which is `prefix_balances[1]`, and it adds either 1 or -1 depending on the value of `s[i - 1]` which is `s[1]`.

From the initial state, we know `prefix_balances[1]` is calculated as:
```
prefix_balances[1] = prefix_balances[0] + (1 if s[0] == '0' else -1)
```

Now, the new assignment will be:
``` 
prefix_balances[2] = prefix_balances[1] + (1 if s[1] == '0' else -1)
```

This indicates that `prefix_balances[2]` will also depend on the values of `prefix_balances[1]` and the value of `s[1]`.

Given this understanding, the output state, still following the format, will be:

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `prefix_balances[2]` is equal to `prefix_balances[1]` plus (1 if `s[1]` is '0' else -1).**
