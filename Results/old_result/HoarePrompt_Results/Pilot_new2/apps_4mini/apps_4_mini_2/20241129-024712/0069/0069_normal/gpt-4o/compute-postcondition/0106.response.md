Postcondition: ***`T` is between 4 and 100, `n` is greater than 0, `index` is valid (previous value + 3), `s` is `data[index + 2]` and valid, `x` is `data[index + 1]` and valid, `balance` is calculated from `s` and is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` contains at least 3 elements, and `b` is the next element in the `prefix_balances` list. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
