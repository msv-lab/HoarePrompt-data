According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. In this case, `i` is currently 2 and `n` must be at least 2 for the loop to execute again. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1 to 3, and `n` must be at least 3 (since `i` must be less than or equal to `n + 1`, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 3).

State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[3]` is equal to `prefix_balances[2]` plus (1 if `s[2]` is '0' else -1)**
