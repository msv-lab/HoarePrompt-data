The variables `n` and `x` are assigned values from `input()`, which reads a line of input and splits it into two parts, converting each to an integer. The previous values of `T` and `_` remain unchanged. The output state reflects the new assignments of `n` and `x`.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `_` is the current iteration (starting from 0), `n` is an input integer, `x` is another input integer**.
