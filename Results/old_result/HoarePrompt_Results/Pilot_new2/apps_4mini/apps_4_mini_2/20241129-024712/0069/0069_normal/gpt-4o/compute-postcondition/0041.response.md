`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, which means `n` will take the integer value from the `data` list at the position specified by `index`. Since `T` is between 1 and 100, and no information about `data` or `index` is provided, the specific value of `n` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `n` is an integer value derived from the `data` list and that `T` remains between 1 and 100. 

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100; `n` is an integer derived from `data[index]`**.
