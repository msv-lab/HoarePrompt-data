The line of code creates a new list `prefix_balances` that is initialized to contain `n + 1` zeros. The prior values of the variables remain unaffected. The variable `prefix_balances` is updated to be a list of length `n + 1`, filled with zeros.

Output State: **`T` is between 4 and 100, `n` is equal to `int(data[index])`, `index` is equal to its previous value plus 3, `s` is now equal to `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` containing all zeros, `x` is equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')**.
