Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description. Here's why:

1. **Balance Calculation**: The program calculates the balance of the string `s` as `balance = s.count('0') - s.count('1')`. This is correct, as it captures the overall balance of zeros and ones in the string.

2. **Prefix Balances**: The program constructs `prefix_balances`, which is an array where each entry `prefix_balances[i]` represents the balance of the prefix of length `i`. This part is also correctly implemented.

3. **Handling Infinite Cases**: The program checks if `balance` is `0`. If it is, it checks whether `x` is in `prefix_balances`. If `x` is present, it appends `-1` to `results`, indicating an infinite number of valid prefixes. This logic is correct for the case when the balance is zero.

4. **Counting Valid Prefixes**: For the case when `balance` is not zero, the program counts how many prefix balances can reach `x` given the number of concatenations of `s`. This is done using the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. This part is also logically sound.

However, the program fails in the following aspect:

- **Count of Valid Prefixes**: The program does not correctly account for the number of prefixes that can achieve the desired balance `x` after an infinite number of `s` concatenations. It simply counts the number of valid prefixes based on the `prefix_balances`, but it needs to also consider how these balances evolve as `s` is repeated infinitely. Specifically, the program fails to handle cases where the infinite repetition of `s` can yield more balances than the length of `s` itself. For example, even if there are no valid prefixes initially counted, there could be several valid prefixes when considering the repeated structure of `t`.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases, especially when calculating the number of prefixes for infinite cases appropriately.

Thus, the final verdict is that the program is incorrect.
