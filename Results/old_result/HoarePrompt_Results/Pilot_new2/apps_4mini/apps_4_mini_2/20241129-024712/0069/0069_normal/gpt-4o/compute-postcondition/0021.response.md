The code appends the value `-1` to the list `results`. Since neither `T`, `n`, `prefix_balances`, `balance`, nor `x` are modified by this operation, their values remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state retains all the relevant information about these variables.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to the sum of the counts of '0's minus the counts of '1's in the first `i` characters of `s` (for `i` from 1 to `n`), the current value of `balance` is equal to 0, `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`, `results` now contains -1 appended to it.**
