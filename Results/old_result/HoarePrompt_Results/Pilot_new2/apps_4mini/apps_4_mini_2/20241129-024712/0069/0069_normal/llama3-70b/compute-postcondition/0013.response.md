Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (greater than 0), `_` is the current iteration (starting from 0), `n` is an input integer, `x` is another input integer, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, and `balance` is not equal to `x`. If `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the printed result is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.***
