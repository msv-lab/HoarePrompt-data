Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 1, `index` is at least 3, `s` is a valid string, and `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` containing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`. If the current value of `balance` is 0, then if `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1; otherwise, `results` contains the appended value `0`. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` now includes the value of `count.***
