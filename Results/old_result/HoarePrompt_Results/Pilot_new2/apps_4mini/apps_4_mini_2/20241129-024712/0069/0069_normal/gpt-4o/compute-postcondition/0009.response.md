The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` was 1, so after the increment, `index` becomes 4. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings from the input, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `s` is the value of `data[3]`.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is the integer value of `data[2]`, `data` is a list of strings from the input, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `s` is the value of `data[3]**
