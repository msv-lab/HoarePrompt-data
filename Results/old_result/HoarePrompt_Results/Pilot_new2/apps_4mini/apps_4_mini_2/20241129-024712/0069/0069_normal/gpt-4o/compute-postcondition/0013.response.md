To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we need to analyze the impact on the variables based on the initial state.

Initial State: `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1

The code snippet:
```
prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)
```

1. `prefix_balances[i]` is being assigned a new value based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]`, and a conditional expression that checks the character in the string `s` at index `i - 1`. 
2. The expression `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` evaluates to `1` if the character at `s[i - 1]` is '0', otherwise it evaluates to `-1`.
3. Since `i` is `1`, this means we are looking at `prefix_balances[1]` which is derived from `prefix_balances[0]` and the evaluation of `s[0]`.

However, we do not have concrete values for `prefix_balances`, `s`, or the specific character at `s[0]`. Therefore, we can only express the output state based on the relationships and conditions.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `prefix_balances[1]` is equal to `prefix_balances[0]` plus (1 if `s[0]` is '0' else -1).**
