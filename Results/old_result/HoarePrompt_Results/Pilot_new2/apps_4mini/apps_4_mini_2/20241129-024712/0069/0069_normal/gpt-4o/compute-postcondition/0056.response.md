The code `results.append(-1)` adds the value `-1` to the `results` list. The initial state does not specify the previous contents of `results`, but it implies that it is a list that can accept new values. Other variables such as `T`, `n`, `index`, `s`, `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is at least 1, `index` is at least 3, `s` is a valid string, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` containing the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s`, the current value of `balance` is 0, the value of `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now contains -1.**
