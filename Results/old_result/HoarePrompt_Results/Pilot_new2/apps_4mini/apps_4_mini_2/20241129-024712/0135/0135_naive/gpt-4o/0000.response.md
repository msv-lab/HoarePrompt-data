To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and see if it covers all potential edge cases.

The problem requires checking if all remainders of `n` divided by integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. The program takes two integers `n` and `k` and performs the following steps:

1. If `k >= n`, it immediately returns 'No'. This is correct because for any `k` that is greater than or equal to `n`, the remainders for `k` will have duplicates since `n % n` is `0` and `n % (n-1)` will also be calculated, leading to potential overlaps with lower moduli.
  
2. It initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to keep track of the remainders that have been seen so far.

3. It iterates through each integer `i` from `1` to `k`, calculating `n % i`. For each remainder, it checks if that remainder has already been seen. If it has, it returns 'No'; otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set.

4. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, it returns 'Yes'.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases:

- If `k = 1`, the only remainder is `n % 1`, which is `0`. The output should be 'Yes' since there cannot be duplicates.

- If `k = 2`, we have two remainders: `n % 1` and `n % 2`. Depending on the value of `n`, this could either return 'Yes' or 'No'.

- The main flaw in the logic arises when `k` exceeds `n`. While this is handled early in the function, what if `k` is significantly larger than `n`? For example, when `n = 5` and `k = 10`, the remainders are:
  - 5 % 1 = 0
  - 5 % 2 = 1
  - 5 % 3 = 2
  - 5 % 4 = 1 (duplicate found)

Here, the function correctly returns 'No' because `k > n`, leading to a duplicate. However, if `n` is large and `k` is not handled correctly, it may miss some duplicates that can occur specifically with larger values.

Now, let's consider a specific test case:

- For `n = 6` and `k = 6`, we would have:
  - 6 % 1 = 0
  - 6 % 2 = 0 (duplicate found)

However, the program would return 'Yes' because it only checks until `k` inclusive. This leads to misleading results, as the duplicates would not have been identified.

Thus, there is at least one case where the program does not function as intended, leading to incorrect outputs.

Correctness: **False**.
