To assess the correctness of the program based on the provided problem description and output hints, let's carefully analyze the code and its logic.

### Problem Description
The goal is to check whether all remainders \( n \mod i \) for \( 1 \leq i \leq k \) are distinct. If any two remainders are the same, the output should be "No", otherwise it should be "Yes". 

### Analyzing the Code
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n:
        return 'No'
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    return 'Yes'

print(func_1(n, k))
```

1. **Check if \( k \geq n \)**: The code correctly returns "No" if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n \) since the remainders from \( n \mod i \) for \( i \) in that case would include \( n \mod n = 0 \) and also \( n \mod 1 = 0 \), thus they cannot be distinct.

2. **Iterating from 1 to \( k \)**: The loop iterates correctly through all values of \( i \) from 1 to \( k \).

3. **Using a Set for Seen Remainders**: The code maintains a set to track seen remainders. If a remainder is found that is already in the set, the function returns "No".

4. **Returning "Yes"**: If all remainders are unique, it returns "Yes".

### Potential Edge Cases
1. **When \( k < n \)**: The current logic should ideally be valid since it only checks for remainders when \( k < n \).
2. **For large values**: As both \( n \) and \( k \) can be as large as \( 10^{18} \), the function needs to handle performance for those cases, but since it uses a set, the performance should still be acceptable due to the linear nature with regard to \( k \).

### Output Hints
The output hints agree with the code stating that the function returns "No" if \( k \) is greater than or equal to \( n \) or if any remainder has already been seen. It returns "Yes" if all remainders are unique.

### Conclusion
Upon analyzing both the problem description and the implementation, the code indeed handles the specified requirements correctly. The checks for distinct remainders are valid, and the early termination condition when \( k \geq n \) is appropriate.

No edge cases seem to be overlooked, as all potential overlaps are checked by the logic of the set.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **True**.
