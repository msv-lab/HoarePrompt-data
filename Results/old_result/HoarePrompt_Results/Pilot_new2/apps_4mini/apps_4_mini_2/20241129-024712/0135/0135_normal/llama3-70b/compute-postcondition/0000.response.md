The variables `n` and `k` are assigned the values from the input, which are two integers. The specific values of `n` and `k` will be determined by the input provided. The initial state specifies that `n` and `k` are integers within the range of 1 to \(10^{18}\). After the execution of the code, the values of `n` and `k` will change to the integers received from the input, while the range condition remains valid.

Output State: **`n` is an integer equal to the first input value, `k` is an integer equal to the second input value, where 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18.**
