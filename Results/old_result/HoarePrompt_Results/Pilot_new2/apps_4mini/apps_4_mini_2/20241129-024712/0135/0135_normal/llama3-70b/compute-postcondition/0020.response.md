`seen` is updated by adding the value of `remainder`, which is equal to `n % 3`. Since `remainder` can have a value of 0, 1, or 2, the updated `seen` set will now include `remainder` as well. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `seen` is a set containing 0, 1, and `remainder`, and `remainder` is equal to `n % 3.**
