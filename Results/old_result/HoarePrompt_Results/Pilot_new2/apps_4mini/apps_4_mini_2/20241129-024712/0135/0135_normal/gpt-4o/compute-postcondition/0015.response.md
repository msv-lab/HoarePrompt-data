According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` compared to `k`. The loop iterates from 1 to `k`, meaning it will execute while `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be equal to the current value of `i` plus one. Therefore, `i` must be incremented by 1 for the loop to execute one more time. 

If we denote the current value of `i` at the end of the last iteration as `i`, for the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`. Thus, at the start of the next iteration, `i` will be `i + 1`. 

For the loop to run again, `k` must be at least `i + 1`.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers within the specified range, `seen_remainders` now includes `remainder`, `i` is `i + 1` and `k` must be at least `i + 1`**
