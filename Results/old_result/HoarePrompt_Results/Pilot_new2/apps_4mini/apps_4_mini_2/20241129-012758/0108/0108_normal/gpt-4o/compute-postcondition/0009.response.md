According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the string `s` and `j` is less than the length of the `target`. 

At the end of the last iteration:
- `i` is 1
- `j` is some value less than 26 (since the loop can only continue if `j` is less than `target_len`)

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than the length of `s`, and `j` must still be less than 26. Since `s` has a length between 1 and 100,000, we need to ensure that `i` does not reach the length of `s` in the next iteration.

Thus, `i` can remain at 1 as long as `s` has at least 2 characters.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length at least 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 1; `j` is less than 26**
