The code assigns a string consisting of the lowercase English alphabet to the variable `alphabet`. This does not change the value of `s`, which remains a string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters as provided by the input. Therefore, the output state reflects the assignment to `alphabet` without affecting the other variables.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters; `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
