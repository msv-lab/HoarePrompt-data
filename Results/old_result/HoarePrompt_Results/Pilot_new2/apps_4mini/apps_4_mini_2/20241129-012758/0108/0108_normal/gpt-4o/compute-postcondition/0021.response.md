The code `print(-1)` outputs `-1` to the console. It does not alter any values of the variables. The previous conditions and values remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is equal to `len(s)`; if `j` is equal to 26, then all characters of `target` were found in `s` in order; if `j` is less than 26, then not all characters of `target` were found in `s`. Also, `j` is not equal to `target_len`, which means that `j` is less than `target_len`. 

Output State: **`i` is equal to `len(s)`; if `j` is equal to 26, then all characters of `target` were found in `s` in order; if `j` is less than 26, then not all characters of `target` were found in `s`. Also, `j` is not equal to `target_len`, which means that `j` is less than `target_len`. Output is -1.**
