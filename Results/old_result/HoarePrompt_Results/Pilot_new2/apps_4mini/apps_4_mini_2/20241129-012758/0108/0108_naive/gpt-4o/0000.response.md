Correctness: **False**.

The provided program correctly checks if the string `s` can contain the English alphabet as a subsequence, but it does not account for the requirement that characters in `s` can be replaced by their following characters in the alphabet. For example, consider the input:

Input:
```
z
```

In this case, the program will output `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to form the subsequence "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz". However, the character 'z' can be replaced with 'a', allowing the transformation of `s` into "a", and then we can continue replacing subsequent characters to eventually form the subsequence.

Therefore, the program fails to handle such cases where the input is a single character that can be transformed. Thus, the program does not satisfy the problem description for all potential cases.
