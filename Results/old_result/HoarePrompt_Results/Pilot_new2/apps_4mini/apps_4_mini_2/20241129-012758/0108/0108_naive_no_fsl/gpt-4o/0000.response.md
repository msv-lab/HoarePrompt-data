Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, it fails to account for the ability to replace characters in the string `s` to form the subsequence "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

### Potential Case:
For the string `s = "aaaaaa"`, the program would check if "a" can match the target "a", but it would not change any letters to reach additional letters in the alphabet. The output of the program would be `-1`, indicating that it is impossible to obtain the complete alphabet as a subsequence. However, the correct transformation should have been possible by replacing subsequent 'a's with 'b', 'c', and so on, ultimately forming the sequence "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz".

Thus, since there exists at least one case where the program does not work as expected, the correctness is determined to be **False**.
