Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not meet the requirements outlined in the problem description. Specifically, the program only checks if the string `s` contains the characters of the English alphabet `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` as a subsequence. It does not perform the required character replacements to form the string as specified.

Here are the key issues:

1. **Character Replacement**: The problem states that you can replace any character in the string `s` with the next character in alphabetical order. However, the program does not implement any mechanism to perform such replacements. It simply checks for the existence of the subsequence.

2. **Output Requirement**: The program only outputs the string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` if it finds all characters in order and outputs `-1` if it does not. The program fails to construct and output a modified string that would be the result of making the necessary replacements to ensure that the alphabet is a subsequence.

3. **Impossibility Condition**: The program does not consider situations where it is impossible to make the necessary replacements to achieve the required subsequence. For example, if `s` contains a character that is too far down the alphabet to reach the needed characters (like starting with 'z'), the program does not handle this case correctly.

Thus, the program does not correctly address the requirements set forth in the problem description, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
