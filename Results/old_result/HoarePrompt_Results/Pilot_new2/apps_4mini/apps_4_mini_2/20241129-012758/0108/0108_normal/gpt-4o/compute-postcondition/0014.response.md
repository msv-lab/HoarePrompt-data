The value of `j` is incremented by 1. Since `j` is currently greater than or equal to 2 and less than 26, the new value of `j` will be greater than or equal to 3 and less than 27. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length at least 2; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is now 2; `j` is now greater than or equal to 3 and less than 27.**
