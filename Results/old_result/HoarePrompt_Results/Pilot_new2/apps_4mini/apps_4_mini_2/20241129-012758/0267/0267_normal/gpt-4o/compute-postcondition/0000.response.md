The variable `total_sum` is initialized to 0. The values of the variables `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged, as they are not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10; `total_sum` is 0.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10; `total_sum` is 0**.
