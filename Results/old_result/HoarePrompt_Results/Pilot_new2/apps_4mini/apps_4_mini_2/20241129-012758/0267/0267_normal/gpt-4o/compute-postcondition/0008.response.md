According to the code, the loop will iterate over the range from `l` to `r + 1`. The current state has `l` and `r` defined such that `1 <= l < r < 10^18`. The loop variable `num` starts at `l` and increments by 1 on each iteration until it reaches `r + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` would be equal to `r`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` would need to be incremented to `r + 1`, which is the next number after `r`.

Since `num` is equal to `r` at the end of the last iteration, in order for the loop to execute again, `num` must be `r + 1`, and the values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` < `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `r` is equal to `r`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `num` is equal to `r + 1`**
