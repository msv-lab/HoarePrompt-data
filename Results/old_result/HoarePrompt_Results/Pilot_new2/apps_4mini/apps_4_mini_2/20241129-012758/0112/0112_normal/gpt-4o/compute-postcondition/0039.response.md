`found` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where index 2 is now True, and `found` is True.
