The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly. Instead, it operates based on the constraints that there is an integer `n` (which is considered to be provided from the input) such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3. The function then processes `n` lines of input, where each line contains 6 integers `a_{i}_{j}` representing the digits on the faces of the cubes, constrained by the condition 0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9.

Given the output is not specified in detail, we can summarize the functionality based on the provided constraints. 

Functionality: **The function reads an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and then reads n lines, each containing 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) representing digits on the faces of cubes. The specific output of the function based on these inputs is not detailed.**
