Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values indicating which cubes have been used, and the current value of `found` is False, implying that no cube was found where `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]` for any `i` such that `0 ≤ i < n.***
