The execution of `break` does not change any variable values but interrupts the current loop or conditional structure. As a result, the values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes all the previous variable conditions, and it notes the break from the loop or statement.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `digits`, `i` is updated to `i + 1`, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `n` must be greater than `i + 1`, `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
