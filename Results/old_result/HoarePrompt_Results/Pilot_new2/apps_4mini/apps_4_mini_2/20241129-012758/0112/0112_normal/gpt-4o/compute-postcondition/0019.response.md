Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least one character; `digit` is the first character in `digits`; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False` except for the last index `n-1`, which is now `True`; if `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]` and `used_cubes[i]` is `False`, `found` is now `True` and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
