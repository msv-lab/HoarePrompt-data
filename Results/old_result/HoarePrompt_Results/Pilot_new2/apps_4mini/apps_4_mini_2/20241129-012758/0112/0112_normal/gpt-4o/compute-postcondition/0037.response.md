According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. This means that for the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented by 1.

After the last iteration, `i` will be increased to 2. To execute one more time, `n` must still be greater than 2, which it is since it can be 2 or 3.

The states that need to be adjusted are therefore:
- `i` will be 2.
- `n` must remain 2 or 3 (but it must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again when `i` is 2).

State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, and `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where at least one index is True.**
