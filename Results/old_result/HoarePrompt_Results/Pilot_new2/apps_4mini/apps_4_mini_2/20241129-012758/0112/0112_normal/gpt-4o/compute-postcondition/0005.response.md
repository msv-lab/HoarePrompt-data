Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`, `found` is `False`, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[i]` is still `False`, and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`.***
