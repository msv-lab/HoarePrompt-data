According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is specified to be an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, it guarantees that the loop will execute at least once. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` will take on the value of `n - 1`. In the context of the loop, `i` will start from 0 and go up to `n - 1`. 

The other variables `digits`, `digit`, `used_cubes`, and `found` do not affect the execution of the loop itself; they are potentially used within the loop body.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the states that need to be established or confirmed are:
- `n` is within the range [1, 3], which ensures the loop executes.
- `i` starts at 0 and will increment on each iteration until it reaches `n - 1`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, where at least one index is `True`, `found` is False**.
