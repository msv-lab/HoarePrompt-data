According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, making `i` equal to 1.

Thus, for the loop to continue executing, `n` must be greater than 1. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 1, `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where at least one index is True**
