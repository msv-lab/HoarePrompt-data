The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `digits`, `i` is 2, `used_cubes[2]` is True, and `found` is True.
