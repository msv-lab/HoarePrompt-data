According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If `digits` has at least one character, the loop will execute. Since `n` is between 1 and 3, it is relevant to note that `used_cubes` has a corresponding length to `n`, which means it is correctly initialized for this range.

Furthermore, at the end of the last iteration (if it were to execute), we do not have specific information about the state of `digit` since it depends on the content of the `digits` list. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that the `digits` list is not empty and that `digit` can start as the first character in `digits`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters that must have at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`**
