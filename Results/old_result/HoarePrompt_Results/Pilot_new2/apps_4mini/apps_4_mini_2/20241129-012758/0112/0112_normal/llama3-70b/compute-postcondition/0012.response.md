Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists containing integers from 0 to 9, and `digits` is a set of string representations of all integers from the cubes excluding '0'. If '0' is present in `digits`, it implies that at least one of the lists in `cubes` contains a 0; otherwise, `digits` contains string representations of integers from 1 to 9.***
