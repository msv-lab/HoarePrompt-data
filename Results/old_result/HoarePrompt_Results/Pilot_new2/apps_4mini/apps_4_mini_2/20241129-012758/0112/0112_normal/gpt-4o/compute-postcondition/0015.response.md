According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1, so if it is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3 and `i` is currently less than `n`, `i` must be incremented by 1 for the next iteration.

Since `i` has already been incremented by 1 at the end of the last iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must now be equal to `n`, meaning it should be 2 if `n` is 3, or 1 if `n` is 2. Additionally, `digit` may still need to be checked against `cube_faces[i]` in the next iteration.

Thus, we can conclude:
- If `n` is 3, `i` needs to become 2 for the next loop iteration.
- If `n` is 2, `i` needs to become 1 for the next loop iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least one character; `digit` is the first character in `digits`; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False` except for index `i`, which is now `True`; `i` is now equal to `n`; `found` remains as per the last iteration's state.**
