According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 3 characters, the loop can execute again for the third character. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `digits` has at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in the list, and thus for the loop to execute one more time, `digits` must have at least 3 characters. Additionally, since `digit` is currently the second character, the next `digit` will be the third character in the list.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `digits`**
