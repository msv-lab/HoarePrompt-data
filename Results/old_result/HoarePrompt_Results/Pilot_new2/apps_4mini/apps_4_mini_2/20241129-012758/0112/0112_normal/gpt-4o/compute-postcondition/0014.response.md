Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least one character; `digit` is the first character in `digits`; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False` except for index `i`, which is now `True`; `i` has been incremented by 1 and is less than `n`; if `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]`, then `found` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
