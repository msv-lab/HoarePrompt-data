The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True` where `i` is 2. The initial condition states that `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, where at least one index is `True`. Therefore, after executing the code, the specific index `i` (which is 2) will now also be `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `digits` is a list of characters with at least two characters, `digit` is the second character in `digits`, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where index 2 is now True.**
