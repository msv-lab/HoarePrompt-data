To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze it step by step.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. Masha can use a set of `n` cubes, where each cube has 6 faces, each showing a digit from 0 to 9.
2. Masha can arrange these cubes to form numbers.
3. The goal is to find the maximum number `x` such that Masha can form every integer from 1 to `x` using these cubes.
4. A number cannot have leading zeros.

### Analysis of the Provided Code:
1. The function `func_1(n, cubes)` takes an integer n and a list `cubes`, where each element contains the digits on the faces of the cubes.
2. It uses a helper function `can_form_number(num)` to determine whether a given number can be formed using the cubes.
3. It checks each digit of the number against the available cubes, marking cubes as used once a digit is placed.
4. The while loop continues to increment `x` until it encounters a number that cannot be formed, at which point it returns `x`.

### Potential Issues:
- **Leading Zeros**: The code does not explicitly handle the case of leading zeros. If `num` starts with 0, it can incorrectly allow for numbers like 01, 02, etc., which are not valid natural numbers. This could lead to an incorrect value of `x` being returned.
- **Digit Availability**: The code considers using a cube for any digit, but does not check explicitly if a number can be formed from available digits without leading zeros.
  
### Example to Test:
- Input:
    ```
    2
    1 2 3 4 5 6
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    ```
    Expected output: `6` (can form numbers from 1 to 6, but not 7).
  
- Input:
    ```
    2
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    0 0 0 0 0 0
    ```
    Expected output: `0` (cannot form any natural number).
  
- However, if we run the first test case through the provided program:
    - The number `01` would incorrectly be considered as available.

### Conclusion:
Since the program does not correctly handle leading zeros and could yield an incorrect maximum due to this oversight, I conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False** 

The program fails to account for leading zeros which can lead to form numbers that should not be valid natural numbers.
