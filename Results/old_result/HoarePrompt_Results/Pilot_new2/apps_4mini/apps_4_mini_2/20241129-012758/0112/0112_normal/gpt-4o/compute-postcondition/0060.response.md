The code `used_cubes[i] = True` sets the value of the `i`-th index in the `used_cubes` list to `True`. In the initial state, `i` is 2, which means the third element (considering 0-based indexing) of the `used_cubes` list is being modified. 

Since no information about `used_cubes` is provided in the initial state, we can only indicate that the third element of this list is now `True`. 

The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `used_cubes`:

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in `digits`, `i` is 2, and `used_cubes[2]` is True.**
