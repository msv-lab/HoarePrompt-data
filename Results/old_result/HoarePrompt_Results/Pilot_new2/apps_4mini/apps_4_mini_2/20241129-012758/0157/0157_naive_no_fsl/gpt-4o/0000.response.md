Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic needed to determine the maximum number of whole fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make the compote in the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's why the program is correct:

1. It reads the input values for lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used based on the ratio:
   - `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`: This line ensures that the number of lemons used does not exceed the available lemons, that the number of apples is sufficient (twice the number of lemons), and that the number of pears is sufficient (four times the number of lemons).
3. It then computes the total number of fruits used in the compote as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which is equivalent to `max_lemons * 7` (since 1 + 2 + 4 = 7).
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits.

The program handles all specified cases correctly, including when there are not enough fruits to make even a single set (resulting in an output of 0). Given the constraints of the problem, it will always produce the correct result for the allowed input range. 

Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
