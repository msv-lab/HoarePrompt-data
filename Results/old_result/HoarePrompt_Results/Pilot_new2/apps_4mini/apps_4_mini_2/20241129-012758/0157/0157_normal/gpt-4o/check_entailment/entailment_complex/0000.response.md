To verify the correctness of the annotated program against the problem description, we need to assess whether it correctly calculates the maximum number of lemons, apples, and pears that can be used in the compote, following the required ratio of 1:2:4.

**Review of the Program Logic:**

1. **Input Reading:** 
   - The program reads three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively. This aligns with the input requirements in the problem description.

2. **Calculating Maximum Lemons:**
   - `max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)` calculates how many complete sets of fruits can be used based on the minimum availability of each fruit type needed for one complete set (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears).
   - This correctly implements the requirement that for every lemon used, exactly 2 apples and 4 pears must be available.

3. **Calculating Total Fruits:**
   - `total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4` computes the total number of fruits used in the compote based on the number of complete sets calculated from the previous step.
   - This calculation adheres to the requirement of summing up the total number of fruits used.

4. **Output:**
   - The function prints the total number of fruits that can be used to create the compote.

**Edge Cases:**
- The program handles the edge case where not enough fruits are available to make even one complete set, as `max_lemons` will yield 0 in such cases. Consequently, the output will be 0, which is consistent with the problem description.

Given these points, the program adheres to the requirements outlined in the problem description for all possible inputs within the specified range.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**
