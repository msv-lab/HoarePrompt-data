The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. All three parameters are positive integers, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears respectively, with the constraints that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function's output is not specified in the prompt, so we cannot determine the return value based on the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept three positive integer parameters representing different types of fruits.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters a, b, and c, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively.**
