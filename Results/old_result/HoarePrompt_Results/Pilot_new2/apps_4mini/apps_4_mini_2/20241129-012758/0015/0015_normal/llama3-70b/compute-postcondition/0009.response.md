The code involves printing 'YES', which does not affect the values of `a`, `b`, or `c`. The conditions regarding `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is as follows: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers updated to the values obtained from user input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9, `c` is not equal to 0, the difference (b - a) is divisible by c, and the result of (b - a) / c is greater than or equal to 0. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers updated to the values obtained from user input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9, `c` is not equal to 0, the difference (b - a) is divisible by c, and the result of (b - a) / c is greater than or equal to 0; 'YES' has been printed.**
