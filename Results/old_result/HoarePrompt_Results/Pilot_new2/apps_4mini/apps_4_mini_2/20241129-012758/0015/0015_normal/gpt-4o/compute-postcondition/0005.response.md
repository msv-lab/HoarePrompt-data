The code simply outputs the string 'NO'. There are no variable assignments or calculations modifying the values of `a`, `b`, or `c`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, and the output does not impact those states.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values. `b` is not equal to `a`. The current value of `c` is 0.**
