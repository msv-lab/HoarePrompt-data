The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input from the user. If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if they are equal, or 'NO' otherwise. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference `b - a` is divisible by `c` and whether the result of this division is non-negative; it prints 'YES' if both conditions are met, or 'NO' otherwise. The function does not return any value; it solely prints results based on these conditions.
