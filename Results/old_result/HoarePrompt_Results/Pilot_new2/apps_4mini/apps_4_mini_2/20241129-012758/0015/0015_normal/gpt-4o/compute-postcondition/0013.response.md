Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `b` is equal to `a`, then 'YES' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a`, and if `c` is 0, no further operations are performed. Otherwise, if `c` is not 0 and `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` with the quotient being greater than or equal to 0, then 'YES' is printed. If these conditions are not met, nothing is printed.***
