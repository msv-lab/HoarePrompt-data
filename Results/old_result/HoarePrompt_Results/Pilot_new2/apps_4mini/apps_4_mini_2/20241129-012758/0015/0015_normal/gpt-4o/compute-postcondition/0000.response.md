The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from `input`, which consists of three integers separated by spaces. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unknown but are within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. After execution, `a`, `b`, and `c` will hold the new integer values provided by the user. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values.**
