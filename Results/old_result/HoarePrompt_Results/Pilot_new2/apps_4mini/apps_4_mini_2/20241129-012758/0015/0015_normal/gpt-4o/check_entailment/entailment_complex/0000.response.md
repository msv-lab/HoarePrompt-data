Correctness: **True**

The provided program accurately fulfills the requirements set forth in the problem description. Here's a detailed breakdown of how the program aligns with each aspect of the requirements:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, which matches the problem's input format.

2. **Checking if `b` appears in the sequence**:
    - The first element of the sequence is `a` (i.e., `s[1] = a`).
    - The difference between neighboring elements in the sequence is `c` (i.e., `s[i] = a + (i - 1) * c`).
    - The program first checks if `b` is equal to `a`. If it is, it prints "YES", which is correct since the first element is indeed `b` when `a = b`.

3. **Handling the case when `c` is zero**:
    - If `c` is zero, all subsequent elements in the sequence will also be `a`, and since `b` is not equal to `a` at this point, it correctly prints "NO". This is consistent with the problem requirement that if `b` does not equal `a` and the sequence is constant (i.e., does not change), then `b` cannot appear in the sequence.

4. **Handling cases when `c` is non-zero**:
    - When `c` is non-zero, the program checks:
        - If `(b - a) % c == 0`: This checks if `b` can be reached from `a` by adding multiples of `c`. This aligns perfectly with the requirement that `b` should appear in the sequence.
        - If `(b - a) / c >= 0`: This checks if we can reach `b` with a non-negative index `i`. It ensures that we are looking for positive integers in the sequence, as required.
    - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO". This correctly reflects the required output based on whether `b` is in the sequence or not.

5. **Boundary Cases**: The program correctly handles all possible values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, including negative values and zeros, as specified in the problem constraints.

Overall, the logic and conditions present in the program account for all the scenarios outlined in the problem description, ensuring that the output is correct for any valid input within the specified bounds. Therefore, the program is correct according to the problem's requirements.
