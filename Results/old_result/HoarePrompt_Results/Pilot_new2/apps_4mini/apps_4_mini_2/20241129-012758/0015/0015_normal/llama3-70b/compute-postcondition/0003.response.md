The code prints 'YES', which does not affect the values of any of the variables (`a`, `b`, or `c`). The initial conditions remain unchanged since the print statement does not modify any state variables. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers updated to the values obtained from user input, where -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9. The current value of `c` is 0. The values of `a` and `b` are equal (`a == b`), and 'YES' is printed.**
