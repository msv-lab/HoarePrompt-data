To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the implementation.

The problem requires checking if a given number `b` appears in an arithmetic sequence defined by:
- The first element `s_1 = a`
- The common difference between consecutive terms `c`

### Program Logic Breakdown:
1. The input is read and split into three integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. If `c` is zero, the program checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
3. If `c` is not zero, the program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` (this checks if `b` can be reached from `a` using steps of size `c`) and `(b - a) / c >= 0` (this ensures that the steps taken from `a` to reach `b` are non-negative).
4. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".

### Edge Cases Consideration:
1. **When `c = 0`**: The sequence is constant (all elements are `a`). The logic correctly handles this case.
2. **When `b < a` and `c > 0`**: The logic correctly handles that `b` cannot be reached since all terms of the sequence are greater than `a`.
3. **When `b > a` and `c < 0`**: The logic correctly identifies that moving backwards (negative steps) cannot reach a greater `b` from `a`.
4. **When `b = a` and `c != 0`**: The program correctly identifies that `b` is part of the sequence since the first element itself is `b`.

### Potential Case for Failure:
The main logic seems accurate; however, we need to check if there are cases that might not be handled correctly. 

Let's consider `a = 1`, `b = 7`, and `c = 3`:
- The sequence is `1, 4, 7`, and `7` is indeed a part of the sequence, so this case should print "YES".

Now consider `a = 1`, `b = 7`, and `c = -3`:
- The sequence would go `1, -2, -5, ...`, and `7` would not be present. The program would still print "NO", which is correct.

Now let's evaluate the case `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `c = -3`:
- The sequence would be `1, -2, -5, ...`, and since `1` is present, it should print "YES". The program will correctly print "YES".

No examples seem to break the logic. 

### Conclusion:
After careful consideration, I do not see any case where the logic fails or does not follow the problem description correctly. Therefore, the program correctly determines if `b` appears in the sequence defined by `a` and `c`.

Correctness: **True**.
