The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the provided constraints, `s` is an integer such that \(0 \leq s \leq 99\). However, since the function definition does not include `s` as a parameter, we cannot accurately describe how the value of `s` is utilized or returned without more context about its usage within the function. Given the lack of return information, we cannot define specific return cases.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its functionality cannot be determined without additional context regarding the use of the integer s.**
