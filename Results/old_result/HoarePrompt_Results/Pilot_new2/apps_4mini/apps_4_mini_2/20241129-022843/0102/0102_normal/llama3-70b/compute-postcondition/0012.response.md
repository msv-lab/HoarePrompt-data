Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is less than 10, the output is the string representation of `s` from the `ones` array. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the output corresponds to the respective value from the `teens` array. If `s` is 20 or greater, the output is derived from the individual tens and ones values using the `ones` and `teens` arrays.***
