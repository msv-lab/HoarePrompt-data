The provided program aims to convert an integer score (ranging from 0 to 99) into its English word representation. 

Upon analyzing the code:

1. **Handling numbers from 0 to 9**: The function correctly returns the corresponding word from the `ones` list.
2. **Handling numbers from 10 to 19**: The function handles the special cases for numbers 11 to 19 by using the `teens` list. However, this logic is flawed because it mistakenly skips the number 10, which should return "ten" but falls into the `teens` block causing an incorrect retrieval.
3. **Handling multiples of 10 (20, 30, ..., 90)**: The function correctly returns the word from the `tens` list when the number is a multiple of 10.
4. **Handling numbers from 21 to 99**: The function correctly returns a combination of the corresponding entries from the `tens` and `ones` lists, separated by a hyphen.

The specific issue identified is that the case when `n` is 10 is not properly handled, as it falls through to the teens block due to the structure of the if-else conditions. The program will return an empty string for `n = 10` since there is no entry in the `teens` list for 10.

Additionally, the output hints state that the function does not handle values outside the specified range of 0 to 99, but given that the problem description restricts the input within this range, this is not a significant concern.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle the case when `n` is exactly 10. 

Correctness: **False**.
