Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts integer scores (0 to 99) into their corresponding English word representations. It handles all cases as specified in the problem description:

- For scores less than 10, it correctly maps them to the `ones` list.
- For scores between 10 and 19, it accurately retrieves the words from the `teens` list.
- For scores from 20 to 99, it uses the `tens` list for the tens place and appends the appropriate word from the `ones` list for the units place, separating them with a hyphen if necessary.

All specified input ranges (0 ≤ s ≤ 99) are covered, and the outputs match the expected values from the examples provided. Hence, the program is correct.
