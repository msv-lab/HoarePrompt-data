The function accepts an integer `n` (where 0 ≤ n ≤ 99) and returns its English word representation. If `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the corresponding string from the 'ones' list. If `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding string from the 'teens' list. For multiples of 10 between 10 and 99, it returns the corresponding string from the 'tens' list. For values between 10 and 99 that are not multiples of 10, it returns a string combining the appropriate entries from the 'tens' and 'ones' lists, separated by a hyphen. The function does not handle values outside the specified range of 0 to 99 and does not account for the case when `n` is exactly 10, which should return 'ten' but is instead falling into the 'teens' block.
