Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 10 ≤ `s` ≤ 99; if `s` is between 10 and 19, the output corresponds to the respective teen value from the `teens` array. If `s` is 20 or greater, the output is based on the individual tens and ones values derived from `s` using the `ones` and `teens` arrays.***
