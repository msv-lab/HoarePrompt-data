The values of `n` and `k` are assigned using the `map(int, input().split())` function, which takes input from the user, splits it, and converts each part into an integer. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not known as they are replaced by input values. The conditions given (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8) still hold, as the new values assigned to `n` and `k` must meet these conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.**
