The value of `n` is incremented by 1, changing the value of `n` from its initial positive integer state to `n + 1`. Since `n` is not divisible by \(10^k\) for \(k\) in the range [1, 8], it follows that `n + 1` must also not be divisible by `x`. The state of the other variables remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not divisible by \(10^k\) for \(k\) in the range [1, 8]; `n` is now incremented by 1; `n + 1` must not be divisible by `x`.**
