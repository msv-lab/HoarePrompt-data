According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to N-1, meaning that `i` will take values from 1 up to N-1. For the loop to execute at least once, `N` must be at least 2, which is already guaranteed by the provided state. 

Before the loop starts, `gcd` is equal to `A[0]`, and since `A` is a list of integers with `N` elements, `A` must have at least one element at index 0 to ensure `gcd` can be defined correctly.

At the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 1. There are no constraints on the values of `K` or the specific values in the list `A` that would prevent the loop from executing, as the only relevant factor is ensuring that `N` is within its defined range and that `A` is properly populated.

Thus, the necessary states to ensure the loop can execute are:

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `gcd` is equal to `A[0]`, `i` is 1**
