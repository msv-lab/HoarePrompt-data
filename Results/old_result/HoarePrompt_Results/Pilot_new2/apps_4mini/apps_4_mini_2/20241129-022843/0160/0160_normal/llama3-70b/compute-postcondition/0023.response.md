To determine the adjusted states at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information step by step.

1. The loop is structured with `for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1)`. This means that the loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to and including `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

2. At the end of the last iteration, we know that the variable `i` is currently at some value that is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

3. The loop will increment `i` by 1 in the next iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to a value that is still within the range specified by `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

4. The current value of `i` is not explicitly given in the state, but we know that `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` at the end of the last iteration if the loop has executed the maximum number of times it can.

5. The next value of `i` will be `i + 1`, which will be `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. Since the range in the loop is exclusive of the upper bound `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, the loop will not execute again unless `gcd` changes.

6. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented and remain within bounds. If `i` is currently `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, the next value of `i` would exceed the range, and thus the loop will no longer be able to execute.

Thus, adjusting for the next iteration, we have:
1. Since the loop cannot execute again if `i` equals `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, we consider the next value of `i` in the loop.
2. The maximum value of `i` that enables the loop to run again would need to be adjusted to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, indicating that the loop has fully iterated through its range.

Given that `max_divisor` should be understood in the context of how it changes when `gcd % i == 0`, if this condition holds true during the loop iterations, ensure that `max_divisor` is appropriately considered.

In summary:
State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `A` is a list of `N` positive integers, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`, `i` is `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, and `max_divisor` may need to be updated based on the last iteration's `gcd` and `i`.**
