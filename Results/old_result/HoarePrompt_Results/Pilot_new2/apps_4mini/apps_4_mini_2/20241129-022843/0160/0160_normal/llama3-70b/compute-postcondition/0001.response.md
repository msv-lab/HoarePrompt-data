The list `A` is modified by taking input and mapping it to integers, which updates the values of `A`. The values of `N` and `K` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this line of code. The new value of `A` will consist of `N` integers as specified in the input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is input, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9.**
