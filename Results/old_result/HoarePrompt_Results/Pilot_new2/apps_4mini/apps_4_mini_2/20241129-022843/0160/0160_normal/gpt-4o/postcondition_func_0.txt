The function accepts a list of integers `lst` where the first integer represents N (the number of elements) and the subsequent integers represent a sequence of integers. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers from the list, starting from the second element to the N-th element. The function assumes that N is at least 2, and thus it does not handle cases where the list may have fewer than two integers. If the list contains only one integer (which is not allowed by the provided conditions), the behavior is not defined.
