Postcondition: ***`x` is a tuple where the first element is an integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is an integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6); if `x` is divisible by `i` (where `i` is `sqrt_x + 1`), the value `x // i` is added to the list of `divisors`.***
