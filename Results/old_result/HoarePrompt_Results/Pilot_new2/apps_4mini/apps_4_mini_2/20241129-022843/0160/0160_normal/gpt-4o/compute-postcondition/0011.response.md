The code `divisors.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to a set called `divisors`. The variable `i` is defined as `sqrt_x + 1`, where `sqrt_x` is the square root of the first element of the tuple `x`, which is `N`. Given that `N` is between 2 and 500, `sqrt_x` will be between approximately 1.41 and 22.36, thus `i` will range from 2 to 23. The set `divisors` changes by including this new value of `i`. No other variables are affected.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is an integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is an integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6), `x` must be at least 4; `i` is `sqrt_x + 1`, and `divisors` has the value of `i` added to it.**
