Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `A` is a list of `N` positive integers, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`, `i` is now 1, `max_divisor` is equal to `max(max_divisor, 1)`, `gcd` must be at least 1, and the current value of `gcd` is divisible by `1`.**
