Postcondition: ***`x` is a tuple where the first element is an integer N (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is an integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6), and `x` must be at least 4. If `x` is divisible by 2, `divisors` now includes the value `N // 2`.***
