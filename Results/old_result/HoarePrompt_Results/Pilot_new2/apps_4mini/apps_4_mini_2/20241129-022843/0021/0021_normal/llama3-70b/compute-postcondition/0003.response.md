The variable `posn` is assigned the value of the index of the integer `n` in the list `a`. Since `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `n` is included in that range, `posn` will be set to the index where `n` is located in `a`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers derived from input, containing `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of the integer 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of the integer `n` in list `a`.**
