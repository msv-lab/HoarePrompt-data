The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates on two implicit parameters: `n` and `a`. Here, `n` is an integer that satisfies the constraint \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \). The second parameter, `a`, is a list containing `n` distinct integers, with each integer within the range from 1 to `n`.

While the output of the function is not specified, based on the provided constraints and typical functionalities of functions working with such inputs, one can infer that the function likely processes the list in relation to the integer `n`. However, without specific output details, we cannot firmly define the return value.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n distinct integers (each in the range from 1 to n), and processes them according to its internal logic.**
