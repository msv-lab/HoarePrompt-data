The value of `max_distance` is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The previous values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are not specified, but they depend on the indices `min_pos` and `max_pos`, which are determined by the occurrences of `1` and `n` in the list `a`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `max_distance` is the maximum of these distances, while the other preconditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`; `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`; `max_distance` is equal to `max(dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4).`**
