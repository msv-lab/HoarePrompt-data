Functionality: ** The function takes an integer `n` (where \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \)) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (each in the range 1 to `n`). It identifies the positions of the integers `1` and `n` in the list and calculates the maximum and minimum distances between these positions, adjusted by the size of the list, before printing the maximum of these values. It does not return any value, only outputs the result directly. **
