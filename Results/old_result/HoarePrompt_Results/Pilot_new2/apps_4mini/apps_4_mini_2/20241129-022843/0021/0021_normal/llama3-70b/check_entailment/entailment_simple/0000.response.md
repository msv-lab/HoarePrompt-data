To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and ensure it meets the requirements.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: An integer `n` and a list `a` of size `n` containing distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
2. **Goal**: Perform exactly one swap in the list `a` to maximize the distance between the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements.
3. **Output**: The maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap.

### Analysis of the Program
1. **Finding Positions**: The program correctly finds the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements using:
   ```python
   pos1 = a.index(1)
   posn = a.index(n)
   ```

2. **Calculating Current Distance**: The current distance between the positions of the minimum and maximum elements is:
   ```python
   abs(pos1 - posn)
   ```

3. **Calculating Maximum Distance After One Swap**:
   - The program computes `max_dist` with:
     ```python
     max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
     ```
     - Here, `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` computes the distance reduced by 1 to account for the swap, and `n - 2` represents the distance achievable by swapping the min and max elements with elements at the extreme ends of the list.
   - It also computes `min_dist`:
     ```python
     min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
     ```
     - However, this calculation isn't necessary for the goal of maximizing distance after one swap.
   - Finally, it attempts to print the maximum distance:
     ```python
     print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))
     ```

### Issues:
- The computation of `min_dist` and its subsequent use in the print statement is unnecessary and potentially incorrect. The goal is only to maximize the distance, so directly calculating `max_dist` would suffice.
- The logic does not correctly reflect the problem requirement of performing exactly one swap to achieve the maximum distance. The computation of `max_dist` does not guarantee it captures the correct maximum achievable distance under the constraints of the problem.

### Conclusion
The program does not correctly implement the required logic to achieve the maximum distance after exactly one swap. It miscalculates the distances due to unnecessary complexity and incorrectly considering `min_dist`, which could lead to incorrect results in certain configurations.

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
