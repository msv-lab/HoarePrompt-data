`dist2` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. The value of `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. Therefore, the value of `dist2` will be calculated based on the specific values of `n` and `max_pos`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos`.**
