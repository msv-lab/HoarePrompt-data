`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` is constrained to be an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. Other variables, including `a`, are not affected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100 (now updated to the input value), `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to n.**
