The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Given that the initial state specifies that `n` is an integer such that \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), the output state reflects that `n` is now an input integer within that range. The variable `a` remains unchanged and still consists of `n` distinct integers within the specified range.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 â‰¤ `n` â‰¤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`.**
