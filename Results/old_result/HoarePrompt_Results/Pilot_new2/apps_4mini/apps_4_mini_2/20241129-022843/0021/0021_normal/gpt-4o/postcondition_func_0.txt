The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers, each in the range from 1 to `n`. It calculates the maximum distance from the positions of the integers 1 and `n` to both the start (index 0) and the end (index `n-1`) of the list, and prints this maximum distance. It does not return any value; it only prints the result.
