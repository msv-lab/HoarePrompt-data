The variable `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`. The value of `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, where `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses` and `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 2 tuples, `i` is 1, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, `time` is equal to `(t - s) % d`, `min_time` is equal to `time`.**
