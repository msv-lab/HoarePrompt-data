Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples, `min_time` is the minimum time calculated from all buses based on the formula `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is the 1-based index of the bus that resulted in `min_time`. If no valid time was found, `min_time` remains float('inf') and `ans` remains -1.**
