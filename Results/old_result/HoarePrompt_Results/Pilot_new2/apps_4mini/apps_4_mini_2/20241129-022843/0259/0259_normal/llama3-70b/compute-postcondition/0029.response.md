Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 3 tuples, `i` is 2, `s` is the first element of the third tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the third tuple in `buses`, and `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to be equal to `time` and `ans` is set to 3.***
