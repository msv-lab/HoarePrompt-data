Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, and `chosen_route` remains unchanged. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1` and `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`.***
