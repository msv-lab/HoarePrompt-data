The values of `s` and `d` are assigned the values from input, which are converted to integers through `map(int, input().split())`. The previous states of `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unchanged; only `s` and `d` are updated based on the input.

Output State: **`n` must be at least 2, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` is a list containing two tuples: the original tuple `(s, d)` and the new tuple `(s, d)`, where `s` and `d` are assigned input integers.**
