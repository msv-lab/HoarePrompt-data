The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of positive infinity, which indicates that it is initialized to a state representing no minimum waiting time has been determined yet. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` such that 1 <= `s_i`, `d_i` <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is float('inf').**
