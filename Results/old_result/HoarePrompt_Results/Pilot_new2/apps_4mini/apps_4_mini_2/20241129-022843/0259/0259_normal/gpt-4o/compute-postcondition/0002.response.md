According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 100, the loop will execute at least once as long as `n` is greater than 0. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` will initialize to 0 on the first iteration. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be at least 1, and at the start of the loop, `i` will be 0. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, and `i` is 0**
