#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, t is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, and bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000.
def func_1(n, t, bus_routes):
    min_wait_time = float('inf')
    chosen_route = -1
    for i in range(n):
        s_i, d_i = bus_routes[i]
        
        if s_i >= t:
            wait_time = s_i - t
        elif (t - s_i) % d_i == 0:
            wait_time = 0
        else:
            wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i
        
        if wait_time < min_wait_time:
            min_wait_time = wait_time

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated from all bus routes, `chosen_route` is the index (1-based) of the bus route with the minimum wait time, if no wait time was found that is less than infinity, `min_wait_time` remains float('inf') and `chosen_route` remains -1.
    return chosen_route
    #The program returns the index (1-based) of the bus route with the minimum wait time, which is stored in 'chosen_route'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `n` representing the number of bus routes, a positive integer `t` representing the current time, and a list of tuples `bus_routes` where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the start time and the frequency of each bus route. The function calculates the minimum wait time for the buses based on the current time and returns the index (1-based) of the bus route with the shortest wait time. If all buses require an infinite wait time, it returns -1, although this scenario is not explicitly handled in the code.
