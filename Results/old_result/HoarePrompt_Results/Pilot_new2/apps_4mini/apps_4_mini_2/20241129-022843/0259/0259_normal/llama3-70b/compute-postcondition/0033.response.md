Functionality: ** The function accepts input values for the number of bus routes `n` and the current time `t`, along with `n` pairs of integers representing the start time `s` and the duration `d` of each bus route. It calculates the minimum wait time for the next bus based on the formula `(t - s) % d`, and returns the 1-based index of the bus that has the shortest wait time. If no valid bus is found (which is practically not possible with the given constraints), it will return -1. The function does not return any value directly; it only prints the index of the bus. **
