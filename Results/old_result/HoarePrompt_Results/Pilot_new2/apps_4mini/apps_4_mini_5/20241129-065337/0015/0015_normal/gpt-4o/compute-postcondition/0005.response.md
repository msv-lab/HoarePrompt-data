The output of the code snippet does not affect the values of the variables `a`, `b`, or `c`, as it only prints the string 'NO'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is:

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values from input, with `-10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9`, and `b` is not equal to `a`; the current value of `c` is 0.**
