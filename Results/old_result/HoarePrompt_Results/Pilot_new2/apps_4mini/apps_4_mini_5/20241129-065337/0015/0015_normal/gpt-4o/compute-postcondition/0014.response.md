The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is implied that within the function, there are three integers, `a`, `b`, and `c`, such that they satisfy the condition -10^9 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 10^9. The function provides no specific output details in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to handle integers `a`, `b`, and `c` within the specified range, but the return value or behavior is not described in the output. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and works with three integers a, b, and c within the range of -10^9 to 10^9, but the specific return value or behavior is not defined.**
