Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya's favorite number `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the common difference `c`.

Here's a breakdown of how the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description:

1. **Direct Match**: The program first checks if `b` is equal to `a`. If they are equal, it correctly outputs "YES", which aligns with the requirement that if `b` is the first element of the sequence, it should be considered present.

2. **Handling Zero Difference (c = 0)**: If `c` is zero (implying the sequence would consist of the same repeated element `a`), and `b` is not equal to `a`, the program correctly outputs "NO". This is in accordance with the problem description, as no other elements can be generated in the sequence.

3. **Non-Zero Difference (c â‰  0)**: For cases where `c` is not zero, the program checks:
   - If `(b - a) % c == 0`, which checks if `b` can be expressed as a term in the sequence. This condition ensures that the difference between `b` and `a` is a multiple of `c`, meaning `b` can be reached by repeatedly adding `c` to `a`.
   - If `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which checks that we can actually reach `b` from `a` by moving in the positive direction along the sequence (if `c` is positive) or the negative direction (if `c` is negative).

By combining these two conditions, the program ensures that it only outputs "YES" when `b` is indeed part of the infinite sequence starting from `a` with steps of `c`. If either condition fails, it correctly outputs "NO".

Thus, the program covers all edge cases and scenarios outlined in the problem description, demonstrating that it functions as intended for all potential inputs within the specified range. Therefore, the assessment concludes that the program is correct.
