To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, letâ€™s analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Description Summary:
- We have a sequence starting with a number `a` and having a common difference `c`.
- We need to determine if a favorite number `b` appears in this sequence. 
- The sequence is defined as:
  - `s[1] = a`
  - `s[i] = a + (i - 1) * c`
- The task is to find if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s[i] = b`.

### Cases to Consider:
1. **When `c` is 0**:
   - The sequence does not change from `a` (i.e., all elements are `a`).
   - `b` is present in the sequence if and only if `b == a`.

2. **When `c` is not 0**:
   - The sequence progresses as `a, a + c, a + 2c, ...`
   - We can express this conditionally:
     - We need to check if `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` (i.e., `(b - a) % c == 0`).
     - Additionally, `(b - a) / c` must be non-negative, which ensures that `i` can be a positive integer.

### Analysis of the Program:
The implementation in the program correctly handles the requirements as follows:

- It first checks if `c` is `0`. If so, it checks if `a` equals `b` and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.
- If `c` is not `0`, it checks the two conditions:
  - If `(b - a) % c == 0`, ensuring that `b` can be reached from `a` by stepping with `c`.
  - If `(b - a) / c >= 0`, ensuring that the steps taken from `a` to reach `b` are valid and involve positive indices.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description in all cases. It effectively checks the conditions for both possible scenarios of `c` being `0` or not.

Therefore, the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
