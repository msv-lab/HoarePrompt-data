Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya's favorite number `b` appears in the arithmetic sequence starting from `a` with a common difference `c`. 

Here's a breakdown of how the program handles various cases:

1. If `b` is equal to `a`, it correctly prints "YES" since the first element of the sequence is `a`.
2. If `c` is `0`, the sequence is constant (all elements are equal to `a`). The program checks if `b` is equal to `a`, printing "NO" otherwise. This is appropriate as `b` can only appear in the sequence if it is equal to `a`.
3. If `c` is not `0`, the program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0`, which confirms that `b` can be reached from `a` by repeatedly adding `c`. Additionally, it verifies `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that the index `i` would be a positive integer, meaning we can only consider positive indices in the sequence.

All tested examples and edge cases align with the problem description and the sequence definition. Thus, there are no found inconsistencies or issues in the program's logic.
