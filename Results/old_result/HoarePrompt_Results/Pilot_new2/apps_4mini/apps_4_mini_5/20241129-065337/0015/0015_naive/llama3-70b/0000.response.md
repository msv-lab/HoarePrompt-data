Correctness: **False**.

The program is incorrect because it does not handle cases where the sequence could be infinite and `c` is negative. For instance, if we have:

Input:
```
a = 5
b = 3
c = -1
```

The sequence generated would be `5, 4, 3, 2, 1, ...`, which includes 3. However, according to the logic in the program, it checks if `(b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0`. In this case, `(3 - 5) % (-1)` would be `2 % -1`, which is not zero, leading the program to print 'NO' incorrectly.

This demonstrates a situation where the program fails to correctly determine that `b` appears in the sequence, thus violating the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
