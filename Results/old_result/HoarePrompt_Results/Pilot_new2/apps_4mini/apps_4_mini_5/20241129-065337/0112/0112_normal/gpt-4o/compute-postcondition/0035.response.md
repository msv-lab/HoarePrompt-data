The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[1]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `found` is True, `i` is 1, `digit` is in `cube_faces[1]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
