The code sets `used_cubes[i]` to `True`, indicating that the cube at the index `i` has now been used. The initial state specifies that `used_cubes[i]` was previously `False`, and now it is `True`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `found` is now `False`, `i` is 0, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]**
