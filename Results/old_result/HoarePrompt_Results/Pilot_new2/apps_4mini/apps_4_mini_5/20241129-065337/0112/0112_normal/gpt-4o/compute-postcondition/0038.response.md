The code assigns the value `True` to `used_cubes[i]`, where `i` is 2. The previous state shows that `used_cubes[1]` is already True, and the value of `used_cubes[2]` will also become True. The other preconditions remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `used_cubes[1]` is True, `used_cubes[2]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `found` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[2]**
