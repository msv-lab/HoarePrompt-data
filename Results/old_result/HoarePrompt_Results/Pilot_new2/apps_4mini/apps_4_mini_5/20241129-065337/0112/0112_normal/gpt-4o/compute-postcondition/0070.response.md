The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`. The parameter `num` is an integer, and it is implied that there are constraints on the input cubes which have digits ranging from 0 to 9. After executing the function body, it can return in the following cases: 

- Case_1: The function returns `False`, indicating that no cube was used based on the initial conditions.
- Case_2: The function returns `False`, indicating that no cube was found that matched the conditions.
- Case_3: The function returns `False`.
- Case_4: The function returns `True`, indicating that all digits were matched.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `num` and determine whether it can be formed using the digits on the faces of the cubes, returning `True` if it can be formed and `False` in various scenarios where it cannot be formed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter num and returns True if all digits can be matched with the cubes; otherwise, it returns False under various conditions where matching is not possible.**
