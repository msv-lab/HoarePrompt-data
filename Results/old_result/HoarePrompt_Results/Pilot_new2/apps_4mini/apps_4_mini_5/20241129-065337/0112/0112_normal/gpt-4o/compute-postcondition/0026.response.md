To determine the conditions for the loop to execute, we need to focus on the state of the variables involved. The loop iterates `n` times based on the given condition that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. Since `n` is already within the required range (1 to 3), it can successfully contribute to the loop's execution.

Next, let's analyze the other variables:

1. `i` will start at 0 and increment with each iteration of the loop.
2. The list `used_cubes` is a collection of boolean values, but its current state does not affect the loop's ability to execute since we aren't checking any conditions based on its values in the loop header — it might affect the loop's internal logic, but not its iteration.

The variable `found` is currently `False`, which might play a role in the loop's body, but again, is not a factor for the loop to start executing. 

Since `digits` is specified as a non-empty iterable with more elements, it implies that there are elements to work with during the iterations.

Given this analysis, the only adjustment we need to consider is the initialization of `i`, which will start at 0. The loop will execute for `i` = 0, 1, and 2, corresponding to the `n` values.

Thus, the final state before the loop executes should clearly state the starting conditions:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `found` is now `False`, `i` is 0.**
