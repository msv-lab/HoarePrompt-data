The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if all of its digits can be matched with the faces of up to three cubes, represented as lists of integers. It returns True if all digits can be matched with unused cubes, and False if any digit cannot be matched or if all cubes have been used before finding a match for a digit. The function does not handle cases where there are fewer than the required cubes for matching or where digits cannot be matched due to constraints on cube usage.
