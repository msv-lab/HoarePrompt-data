The code `break` indicates that we exit from the most internal loop or conditional statement we were directly inside. The values of the variables themselves do not change, but we no longer continue executing the code within that loop or conditional. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the action taken. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `found` is now True, `i` is 0, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
