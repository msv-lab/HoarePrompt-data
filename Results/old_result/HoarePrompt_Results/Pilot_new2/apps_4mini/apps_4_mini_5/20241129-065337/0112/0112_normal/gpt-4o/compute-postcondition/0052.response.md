The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `used_cubes` has index `i` set to `True`, `found` is True, `i` is 1 or 2, `digits` has at least `i + 1` digits, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
