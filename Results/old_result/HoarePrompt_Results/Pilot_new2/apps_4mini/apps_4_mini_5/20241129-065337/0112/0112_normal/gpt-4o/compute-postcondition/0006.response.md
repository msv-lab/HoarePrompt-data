The code updates the list `used_cubes` by setting the element at index `i` to `True`. The state of other variables remains unchanged, so the output state will reflect the updated value of `used_cubes[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values initialized to [True] + [False] * (n-1), `digits` is a non-empty iterable, `found` is False, `i` is 0.**
