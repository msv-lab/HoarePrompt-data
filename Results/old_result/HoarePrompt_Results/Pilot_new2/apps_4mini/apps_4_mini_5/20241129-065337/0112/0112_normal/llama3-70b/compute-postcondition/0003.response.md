According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. Since `n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` must contain at least 1 list for the loop to execute. The `digits` set is empty initially, but that does not affect the execution of the loop. At the start of the loop, `cube` should be the first list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `digits` is an empty set, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`**
