According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is either 2 or 3. 

1. If `i` is 2, for the next iteration, `n` must be greater than 3 for the loop to execute again.
2. If `i` is 3, for the next iteration, `n` must be greater than 4 for the loop to execute again.

Additionally, the state of `used_cubes[i]` indicates that it was set to `True`, and we know that `found` is `True` and `digits` has at least `i + 1` digits. However, the key variable for future iterations is the value of `n` relative to `i`.

Thus, if `i` is currently 2, `n` must be greater than 3, and if `i` is currently 3, `n` must be greater than 4. 

Therefore, we can conclude:

State: **`n` must be greater than 3 if `i` is 2 or greater than 4 if `i` is 3; `used_cubes` at index `i` is still set to `True`; `found` is True; `i` is 3 or 4; `digits` has at least `i + 1` digits.**
