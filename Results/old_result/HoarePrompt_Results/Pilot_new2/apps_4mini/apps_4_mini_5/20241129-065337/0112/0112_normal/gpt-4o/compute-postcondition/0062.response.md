The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 3 if `i` is 2 or greater than 4 if `i` is 3; `used_cubes` at index `i` is still set to True; `found` is True; `i` is 3 or 4; `digits` has at least `i + 1` digits, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
