The code assigns the value `True` to `used_cubes[i]`, where `i` is currently 1. Since `used_cubes[i]` was already `True`, this assignment does not change its value. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[1]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `found` is now True, `i` is 1, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[1]`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[1]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `found` is now True, `i` is 1, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[1]`.**
