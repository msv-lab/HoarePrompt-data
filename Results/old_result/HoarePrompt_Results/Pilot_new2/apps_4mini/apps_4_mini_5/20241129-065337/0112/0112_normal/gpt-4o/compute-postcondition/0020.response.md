Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values indicating which cubes have been used based on the presence of `digit` in the respective `cube_faces`, `digits` is a non-empty iterable, and `found` is True if `digit` was found in any of the `cube_faces`. If no cube was used, `used_cubes` remains as initially set to [False] * n and `found` remains False.**
