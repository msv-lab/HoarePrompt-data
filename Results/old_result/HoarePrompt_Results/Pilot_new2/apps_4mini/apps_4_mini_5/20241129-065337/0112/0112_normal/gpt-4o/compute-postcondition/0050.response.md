The value of `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, indicating that the cube at index `i` has now been used. The other variables retain their previous values, and there are no additional calculations or changes needed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 1, `used_cubes` has index `i` set to `True`, `found` is False, `i` is 1 or 2, and `digits` has at least `i + 1` digits, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `used_cubes` has index `i` set to `True`, `found` is False, `i` is 1 or 2, `digits` has at least `i + 1` digits, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.**
