The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables retain their previous states, as they are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of boolean values initialized to [True] + [False] * (n-1), `digits` is a non-empty iterable, `found` is True, `i` is 0.
