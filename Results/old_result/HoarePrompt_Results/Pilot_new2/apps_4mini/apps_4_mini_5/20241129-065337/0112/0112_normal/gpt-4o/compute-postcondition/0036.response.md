Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[1]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `found` is True, `i` is 1, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[1]`. If `used_cubes[1]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[1]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the program continues executing without any change.***
