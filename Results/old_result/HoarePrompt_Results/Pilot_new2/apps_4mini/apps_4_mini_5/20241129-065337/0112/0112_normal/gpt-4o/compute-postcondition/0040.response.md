The code snippet contains a `break` statement, which does not change any variable values but exits from the current loop or block. The other variables' states remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that the execution has exited the most internal loop or if statement without altering any variable values.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `used_cubes[1]` is True, `used_cubes[2]` is True, `digits` is a non-empty iterable with more elements, `found` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[2]`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
