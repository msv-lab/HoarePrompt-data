Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `used_cubes` at index `i` is set to `True`, `found` is True, `i` is 1 or 2, `digits` has at least `i + 1` digits, if `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `digit` is not in `cube_faces[i]` or `used_cubes[i]` is already True, there is no change in `used_cubes[i]` or `found`.***
