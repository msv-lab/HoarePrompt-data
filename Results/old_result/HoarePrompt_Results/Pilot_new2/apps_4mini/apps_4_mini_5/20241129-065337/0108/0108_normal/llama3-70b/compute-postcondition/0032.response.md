According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being present in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that `s` must have contained at least 1 occurrence of the character following `char`, `s` must contain at least 1 occurrence of `char`, and `res` includes at least one more occurrence of `char`. 

Since `s` must contain `char` for the while loop to execute one more time, and it's already established that `char` is in `s`, no adjustments are needed to ensure that condition is satisfied. 

State: **`s` must have contained at least 1 occurrence of the character following `char`, `s` must contain at least 1 occurrence of `char`, `res` includes at least one more occurrence of `char`.**
