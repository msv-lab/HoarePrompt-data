The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and processes it to check for all characters from 'a' to 'z'. It constructs a new string `res` that contains the characters found in `s` in the order they appear, but without duplicates. If `s` contains all letters from 'a' to 'z', it prints `res` (which will be 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'). If not all letters are present, it prints -1. The function does not explicitly handle cases where `s` might contain characters outside the range of 'a' to 'z', but it will still function correctly since it only processes lowercase English letters.
