According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. If `char` is still found in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has already been updated to not contain the first occurrence of `char`, and `char` has been replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must still exist in `s`. Since the loop body is omitted, we cannot determine whether the updated string `s` has any occurrences of the new value of `char`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `s` must contain the new `char` value after the update.

Thus, we need to adjust `s` to ensure that it includes the new `char` (i.e., `char`'s next ASCII value).

State: **`s` must include the new value of `char` (which is `chr(ord(char) + 1)`)**
