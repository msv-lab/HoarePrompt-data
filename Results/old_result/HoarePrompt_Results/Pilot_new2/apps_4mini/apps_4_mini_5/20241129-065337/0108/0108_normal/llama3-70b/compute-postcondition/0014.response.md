To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information step by step.

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop iterates over `alphabet`. This implies that it will execute for each character in `alphabet`.

2. **Current State**: At the end of the last iteration:
   - If the original string `s` contained characters from 'a' to 'z', then `s` is empty.
   - `res` contains characters from 'a' to the maximum character present in the original `s`.
   - If fewer characters were present, `s` would exclude characters that were in `res`, and `res` contains all characters from 'a' to the maximum character present in the original `s` with no duplicates.
   - If the original `s` had no 'a', then `res` remains empty and `s` remains unchanged.

3. **Iterating through Alphabet**: The loop will continue until all characters in `alphabet` have been processed. Therefore, we need to establish what the current character (`char`) is during the last iteration to determine the next state.

4. **State Adjustment**: 
   - If `res` is not empty, then `s` is empty and should remain empty. 
   - If `res` includes characters from 'a' to the maximum character of the original string, the loop should proceed to the next character in `alphabet`.
   - The loop control variable `char` will be updated to the next character in `alphabet`.

Assuming that the loop has processed some characters already, we need to consider the next character in `alphabet` for the next iteration.

Hence, if we denote that `char` is currently at a certain position in `alphabet`, then in the next iteration, `char` will be the next character.

State: **`s` is empty, `res` contains characters from 'a' to the maximum character present in the original `s`, `char` must be the next character in `alphabet`.**
