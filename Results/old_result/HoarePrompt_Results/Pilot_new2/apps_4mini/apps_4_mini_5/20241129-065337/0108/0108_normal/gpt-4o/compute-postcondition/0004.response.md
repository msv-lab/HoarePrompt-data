To determine which states need to be adjusted for the `while` loop to execute at least once, we need to analyze the loop condition: `i < len(s) and j < target_len`.

1. The condition `i < len(s)` requires that `i` be less than the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is guaranteed to have a length between 1 and 100,000, but `i` is currently 0, this condition holds true as long as `len(s)` is at least 1 (which it always is).
   
2. The condition `j < target_len` requires that `j` be less than the length of the `target`. Since `target` is defined as 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', its length is 26, and `j` is currently 0, this condition also holds true.

Both conditions of the `while` loop are satisfied with the provided states, meaning the loop can execute.

Therefore, we do not need to adjust any states for the loop to execute one time as both conditions are already met.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000 inclusive; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0**
