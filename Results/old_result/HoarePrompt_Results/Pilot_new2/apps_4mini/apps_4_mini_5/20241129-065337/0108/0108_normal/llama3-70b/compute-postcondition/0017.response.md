The code snippet provided replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that has an ASCII value one greater than that of `char`. Therefore, the variable `s` is updated. The variable `res` is not modified in this code. 

To summarize the impact:
- `s` will be updated to a new string where the first occurrence of `char` is replaced with the next character in the ASCII sequence.
- The state of `res` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`s` now contains the updated string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with `chr(ord(char) + 1)`; `res` is updated to include `char`.**
