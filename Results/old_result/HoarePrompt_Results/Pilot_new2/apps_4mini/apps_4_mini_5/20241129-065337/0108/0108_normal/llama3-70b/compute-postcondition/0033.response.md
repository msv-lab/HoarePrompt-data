The variable `res` is updated by concatenating `char` to its current value. Since it is stated that `res` includes at least one more occurrence of `char`, it means that `res` will now have one additional occurrence of `char` added to its previous value. The values of `s` and `char` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the updated value of `res`.

Output State: **`s` must have contained at least 1 occurrence of the character following `char`, `s` must contain at least 1 occurrence of `char`, `res` includes at least two occurrences of `char`.**
