The `s` variable is modified by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII table (i.e., `chr(ord(char) + 1)`). The `res` variable is updated to include `char`, but we don't have a specific value for `res` provided. Therefore, we only focus on the changes to `s`.

The value of `s` after this operation will depend on the initial string and the character, but since `s` must contain `char`, we can confirm that `char` is in `s` and will be replaced. The other variable (`res`) is updated but we can't specify the exact new value since we don't have its initial state.

Output State: **`s` must contain `char`, `s` is updated to replace the first occurrence of `char` with the character after `char` in ASCII, `res` is updated to include `char`.**
