According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `alphabet`. If there are more characters in the `alphabet` after the current `char`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is now the first character after the maximum character present in the original `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be the next character in `alphabet` after the current `char`. 

State: **`s` is a string where all occurrences of characters from the original `s` that were equal to or less than the maximum character have been replaced by their subsequent characters in the ASCII table; `res` contains a concatenation of all characters from the original `s` that were equal to or less than the maximum character, in the order they were found; `char` is the next character in `alphabet` after the current character.**
