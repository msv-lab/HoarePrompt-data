The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The variable `j` remains unchanged, and the condition involving `s` and `target` is not impacted by this operation. Other variables are not affected, and the relationship among the variables stays the same.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length greater than `i + 1`; if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented and remains less than `target_len`; `i` is incremented by 1.**
