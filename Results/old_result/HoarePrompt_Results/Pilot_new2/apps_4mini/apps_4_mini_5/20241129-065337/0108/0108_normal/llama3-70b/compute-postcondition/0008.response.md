The variable `res` is concatenated with `char`, which is equal to 'b'. Therefore, `res` now contains the previous value of `res` plus 'b'. The other variables `s` and `char` remain unchanged. The value of `res` will depend on its initial state, which is not provided. It is mentioned that `char` must be 'b', so we can state that `res` is now `previous_value_of_res + 'b'`.

Output State: **`s` contains 'b', `char` is 'b', `res` is equal to `previous_value_of_res + 'b'**.
