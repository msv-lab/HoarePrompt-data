Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is equal to the sum of all `num` values in the range from `l` to `r` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, and `num` will have the last value in the range, which is `r`. If no values satisfy `func_1(num, k)`, then `total_sum` remains 0.**
