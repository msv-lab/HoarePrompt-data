In the given code snippet, `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The variable `num` is defined as `l + 1` if `l + 1 <= r`. This will affect `total_sum` based on the value of `num` and the existing value of `total_sum`.

1. **Understanding `num`:** 
   - `num` is updated to `l + 1` if `l + 1 <= r`. 
   - If `l + 1 > r`, `num` remains unchanged.

2. **Understanding `total_sum`:**
   - `total_sum` will be updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.
   - The value of `total_sum` will change depending on the value of `num` and its previous value.

Assuming `l + 1 <= r`, `num` becomes `l + 1`. 

Thus, `total_sum` is updated as follows:
- `total_sum` = `(total_sum + (l + 1)) % MOD`.

The output state will reflect the updated value of `total_sum` along with the unchanged values of `l`, `r`, and `k`.

Output State: **`l` is unchanged, `r` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `total_sum` is equal to `(total_sum + (l + 1)) % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l + 1`.**
