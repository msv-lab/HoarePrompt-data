The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + (10`, but since there isn't a complete expression provided, we assume the addition results in a new value for `dp[n, k]`. After this update, the next line `dp[n, k] %= MOD` assigns to `dp[n, k]` the value of itself modulo `MOD`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not directly affected by the code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `l` is unchanged, `r` is unchanged, `k` is unchanged, `dp[n, k]` is updated to a new value `dp[n, k] + (10) mod MOD`.

Output State: **`l` is unchanged; `r` is unchanged; `k` is unchanged; `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + (10) mod MOD**.
