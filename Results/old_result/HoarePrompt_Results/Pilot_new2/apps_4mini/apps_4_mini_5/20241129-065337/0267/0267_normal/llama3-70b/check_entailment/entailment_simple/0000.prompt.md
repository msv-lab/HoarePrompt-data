You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
def func_1(l, r, k):
    dp = {}
    return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
    #The program returns the difference between the counts of 'r' and 'l - 1', both calculated with respect to 'k', modulated by MOD, where 'count' is assumed to be a function defined elsewhere that computes the required counts based on the inputs.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
def count(n, k, dp):
    if (k == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0, which is the current value of k.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `k` is not equal to 0.
    if ((n, k) in dp) :
        return dp[n, k]
        #The program returns the value associated with the pair (n, k) in the dictionary `dp`.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `k` is not equal to 0. The pair `(n, k)` is not present in `dp`.
    if (n < 10 ** k) :
        dp[n, k] = n
    else :
        dp[n, k] = 9
        for i in range(1, k):
            dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: - The integer values `l` and `r` remain the same as in the initial state, since they are not modified by the loop.
        #- The value of `k` will be the same as in the initial state, as it also isn't modified.
        #- After the loop has executed for `k-1` times, `dp[n, k]` will contain the cumulative result of all updates made during each of these iterations.
        #
        #The output state must reflect these relationships.
        #
        #Output State:
        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
        dp[n, k] %= MOD
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `k` is not equal to 0. If `n` is less than 10 raised to the power of `k`, then the pair `(n, k)` is now present in `dp` with `dp[n, k] = n`. Otherwise, `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged while `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 10 mod MOD`.
    return dp[n, k]
    #The program returns dp[n, k], where dp[n, k] is either n if n is less than 10 raised to the power of k, or it has been updated to dp[n, k] + 10 mod MOD if n is not less than 10 raised to the power of k.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
