The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the value of the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, `b // 2` will be half of `b` (using floor division), and `c // 4` will be a quarter of `c` (also using floor division). Other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.**
