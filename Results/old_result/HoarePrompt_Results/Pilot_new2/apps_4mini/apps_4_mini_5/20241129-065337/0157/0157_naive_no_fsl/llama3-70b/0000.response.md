To verify the correctness of the program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code and how it handles various cases.

1. **Understanding the Logic**:
   - The program reads the number of lemons `a`, apples `b`, and pears `c`.
   - It calculates the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used in the ratio of 1 lemon : 2 apples : 4 pears. 
   - The number of complete sets (or "batches") of fruits is determined by the minimum value of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` which ensures that the required ratios are met.
   - Finally, it calculates the total number of fruits used in the maximum sets and prints that value.

2. **Key Check**:
   - The program calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum count of complete sets of fruits.
   - The total fruits used is calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`.

3. **Testing Edge Cases**:
   - Consider the input case: `a = 1`, `b = 2`, `c = 4`. 
     - Here, the program would compute `min_lemon` as `min(1, 2 // 2, 4 // 4)`, which results in `1`. 
     - Therefore, it outputs `1 * 7 = 7`, which is correct.
   - Now consider a case where `a = 0`, `b = 5`, `c = 8` (even though `a`, `b`, `c` should be positive according to the constraints, testing with `0` is fundamental for edge handling).
     - Here, `min(0, 5 // 2, 8 // 4)` would lead to `min_lemon = 0`, and the program outputs `0`, which is also correct.

4. **Finding a Failing Case**:
   - If we take `a = 2`, `b = 3`, `c = 2`, as in the third example provided in the problem description, we see that `min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4)` results in `0` since `2 // 4` is `0`. Thus, it outputs `0`, which also matches the expected output.
   - However, if we take `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`, the expected output should be `0` because there aren't enough fruits to form even a single batch. The program correctly outputs `0` as well.

5. **Conclusion**: 
   - The logic correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits that can be used based on the input constraints and the specified ratios. It handles edge cases and correctly follows the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
