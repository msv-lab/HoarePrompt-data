The provided program aims to determine the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that Nikolay can use to make a compote based on the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Reading**: 
   - The program reads three integers from input: `a` (lemons), `b` (apples), and `c` (pears).
   - This aligns with the problem description.

2. **Calculating Maximum Sets**: 
   - The program calculates `min_lemon` as the minimum of:
     - `a`: the number of lemons available.
     - `b // 2`: the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with apples (since for each lemon, 2 apples are needed).
     - `c // 4`: the maximum number of lemons that can be paired with pears (since for each lemon, 4 pears are needed).
   - This calculation correctly determines the maximum number of complete sets of fruit that can be used in the specified ratio.

3. **Output Calculation**:
   - The program then prints the total number of fruits used based on the number of sets of lemons calculated:
     - For `min_lemon` lemons, it adds `min_lemon * 2` for apples and `min_lemon * 4` for pears to produce the total sum.
   - The total output correctly reflects the formula \( 1 \times \text{min_lemon} + 2 \times \text{min_lemon} + 4 \times \text{min_lemon} = 7 \times \text{min_lemon} \).

### Edge Cases:
- If `min_lemon` is 0 due to insufficient apples or pears, the output will correctly return 0, which aligns with the problem requirement.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic required by the problem description and handles edge cases properly. 

Correctness: **True**
