The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. Each of these parameters represents positive integers, where `a` is the number of lemons, `b` is the number of apples, and `c` is the number of pears. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are constrained to be in the range 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function does not return any values in the given output, hence the functionality is not explicitly defined in terms of a return value or outcome.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters a, b, and c, which are positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively, with values in the range 1 to 1000.**
