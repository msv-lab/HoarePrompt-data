Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, and `assigned` is a set containing elements from the list `a`, which is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a[k]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[k]` ≤ 10^9. If `can_form` is False, then `m` is updated to 2. Otherwise, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
