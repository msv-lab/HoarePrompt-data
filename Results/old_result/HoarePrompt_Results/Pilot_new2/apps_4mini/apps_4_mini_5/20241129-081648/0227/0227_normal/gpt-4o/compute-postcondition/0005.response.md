The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged since this is a straightforward assignment without any calculations or conditions affecting them. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values along with the new value of `can_form`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `assigned` is a set containing the element a[0], `m` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers where each integer a[k] satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9, `can_form` is False.**
