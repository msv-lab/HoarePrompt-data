The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` containing `n` distinct positive integers. It sorts the list and counts the number of unique integers that cannot be expressed as the difference of two integers in a set formed by the elements of `a`. The function returns this count. It is important to note that the function does not handle cases where `a` might be empty or contain non-distinct elements, even though the input constraint requires `a` to have distinct integers.
