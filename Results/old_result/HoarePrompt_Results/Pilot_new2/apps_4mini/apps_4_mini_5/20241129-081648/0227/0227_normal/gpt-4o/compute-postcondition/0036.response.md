The code sets the variable `can_form` to `True`. This directly assigns a boolean value to `can_form`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged, and their previous conditions are still valid.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `assigned` is a set containing elements from the list `a`, including `a[1]`, and `x` is the next element in `assigned`; `can_form` is True.**
