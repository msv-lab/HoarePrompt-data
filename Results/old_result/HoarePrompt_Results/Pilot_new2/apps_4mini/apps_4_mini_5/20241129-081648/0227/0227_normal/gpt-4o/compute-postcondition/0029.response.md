The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 2, `assigned` is a set containing elements from the list `a`, including `a[1]`, `can_form` is True, and the value of `(a[i] - x)` is in the set `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
