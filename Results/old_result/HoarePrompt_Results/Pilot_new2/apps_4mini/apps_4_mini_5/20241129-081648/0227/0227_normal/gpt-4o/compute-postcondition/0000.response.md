`a.sort()` sorts the list `a` in ascending order. The variable `n` remains unchanged, but the order of elements in the list `a` will change to be from the smallest to the largest positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and `a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers where each integer a[k] satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, `a` is a sorted list of n distinct positive integers where each integer a[k] satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9.**
