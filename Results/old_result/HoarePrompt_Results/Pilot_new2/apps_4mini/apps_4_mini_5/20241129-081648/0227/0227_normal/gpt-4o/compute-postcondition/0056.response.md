The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`, which does not directly depend on any previous values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a non-empty set containing at least one element, `x` is the next element in the set `assigned` (after the previous `x`), and `can_form` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 3, `i` is 3, `assigned` is a non-empty set containing at least one element, `x` is the next element in the set `assigned` (after the previous `x`), `can_form` is True**.
