The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 23) and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9). It counts how many elements in the sorted list `a` are not equal to double the previous element, initialized with a count of 1. Finally, it prints this count `m`, but if `m` exceeds 23, it prints -1 instead. The function does not return any value.
