Postcondition: ***`n` must be greater than 1, `i` is 1, `assigned` is a set containing the element `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers where each integer `a[k]` satisfies 1 ≤ `a[k]` ≤ 10^9, `can_form` is False, and the value of `a[i] - x` is an element in the `assigned` set.***
