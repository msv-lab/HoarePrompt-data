The `exit()` command immediately stops the execution of the program, and no variables are modified or returned. The current state of all variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `remainder` is equal to `n % 3`, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, and the output printed is 'No'.**
