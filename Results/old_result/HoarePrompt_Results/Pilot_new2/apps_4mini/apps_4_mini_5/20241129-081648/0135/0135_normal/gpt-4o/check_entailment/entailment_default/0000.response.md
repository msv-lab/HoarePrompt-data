To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's first analyze the code and the requirements in detail.

### Problem Description Analysis:
The task is to check whether the remainders of the division of a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct, meaning there should not be any pair `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n mod i = n mod j`.

### Code Analysis:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
print(func_1(n, k))

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n:
        return 'No'
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    return 'Yes'
```

1. **Initial Check:** The function first checks if `k >= n`. If true, it returns 'No'. This is because if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the remainders from `1` to `k` must repeat, specifically `n mod n` will always be `0`, which guarantees duplicates.
  
2. **Loop through Divisors:** The function then iterates through all integers from `1` to `k`, calculating `n mod i`. It uses a set to track seen remainders. If a remainder is found in the set, it returns 'No', indicating a duplicate remainder was found. If all remainders are distinct, it returns 'Yes'.

### Edge Case Consideration:
1. **Case when `k < n`:** The logic here is sound as it checks for each `i`, and with `k < n`, the remainders calculated are constrained to `1` to `k`, avoiding the case where `n mod n` could cause duplicates.
  
2. **Boundary Value Handling:** The logic should handle small values of `n` and `k`, especially `n = 1`, `k = 1`, where only one division occurs, and the modulus operation results in `0` (which is valid).

3. **Large Inputs:** Given the constraints (up to `10^18`), the algorithm runs in linear time relative to `k`, which is efficient and feasible within the limits.

### Output Hints Evaluation:
The output hints state that the function will return 'No' if any remainders are repeated. The hints are accurate and agree with the code logic. They correctly summarize that if all remainders are unique, the function returns 'Yes'.

### Conclusion:
After considering the problem description, the code logic, and the output hints, the code correctly implements the requirements. All corner cases appear to be handled properly.

Thus, the program meets the problem description criteria for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**.
