Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not correctly handle the case where \( k \) is greater than \( n \). Specifically, when \( k > n \), the remainders for \( n \mod i \) where \( i \) takes values from \( n+1 \) to \( k \) will all be equal to \( n \). This results in duplicate remainders, which means the program should output "No". For example, if we have the input:

```
n = 3
k = 5
```

The remainders will be:
- \( 3 \mod 1 = 0 \)
- \( 3 \mod 2 = 1 \)
- \( 3 \mod 3 = 0 \)
- \( 3 \mod 4 = 3 \)
- \( 3 \mod 5 = 3 \)

In this case, both \( 3 \mod 4 \) and \( 3 \mod 5 \) are equal, hence violating the distinctness condition. The code outputs "No" correctly in such cases, but if \( n < k \) and ensures that any \( i \) greater than \( n \) would yield a remainder equal to \( n \).

Thus, the program fails for cases where \( k > n \), providing evidence that it does not meet the problem's requirements for all potential inputs.
