The code simply prints 'No' to the output, but it does not modify any variables. Therefore, the states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and `seen` now contains the value of `remainder`.**
