Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when \( k \) is greater than \( n \). Specifically, for any \( i \) such that \( n < i \leq k \), the remainder \( n \mod i \) will always be \( n \) because \( n \) is less than \( i \). 

For example, if we take \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 6 \):
- The remainders will be:
  - \( n \mod 1 = 0 \)
  - \( n \mod 2 = 1 \)
  - \( n \mod 3 = 2 \)
  - \( n \mod 4 = 1 \) (duplicate)
  - \( n \mod 5 = 0 \) (duplicate)
  - \( n \mod 6 = 5 \)

In this case, there are duplicates (1 and 0), so the output should be "No". However, the program will erroneously conclude that all remainders are distinct when \( k > n \) because it only checks up to \( k \) and does not account for the duplicates that arise from the remainders for \( i > n \). 

Thus, the program fails for inputs like \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 6 \).
