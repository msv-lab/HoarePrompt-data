The code `exit()` is called, which terminates the program execution immediately. Therefore, no changes are made to any variables.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0, and the current value of `remainder` is in the set `seen`; program execution is terminated.**
