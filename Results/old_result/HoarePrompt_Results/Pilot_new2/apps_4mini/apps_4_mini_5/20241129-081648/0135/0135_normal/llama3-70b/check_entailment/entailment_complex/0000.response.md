To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and how it relates to the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to check if all remainders of dividing a number `n` by every integer from `1` to `k` are distinct. If any two remainders are equal, we should print "No". If all remainders are distinct, we should print "Yes".

### Annotated Program Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
2. **Distinct Remainders Check**:
   - A set named `seen` is used to keep track of the unique remainders.
   - A loop runs from `1` to `k` (inclusive), calculating the remainder of `n % i` for each `i`.
   - If a remainder is already in the `seen` set, it prints "No" and exits.
   - If no duplicates are found during the loop, it prints "Yes".

### Key Considerations
- The loop iterates from `1` to `k`, which includes both end points.
- The implementation correctly checks for duplicates using a set, which efficiently tracks unique values.
- The edge case where `k` is very large (up to 10^18) needs attention:
  - For any divisor larger than `n`, the remainder will always be `n` itself.
  - Thus, when `k > n`, we will have `n % i = n` for all `i > n`, leading to potential duplicates.

### Conclusion
The program fails in situations where `k` exceeds `n`. For instance:
- If `n = 5` and `k = 6`, the remainders would be:
  - 5 % 1 = 0
  - 5 % 2 = 1
  - 5 % 3 = 2
  - 5 % 4 = 1 (duplicate)
  - 5 % 5 = 0 (duplicate)
  - 5 % 6 = 5
- Here we see duplicates, but the program would not account for the fact that as `k` increases beyond `n`, it guarantees duplicates in the remainders.

Since the program does not correctly handle cases where `k > n`, it does not meet the problem description for all potential cases.

Therefore, the final evaluation is:

Correctness: **False**
