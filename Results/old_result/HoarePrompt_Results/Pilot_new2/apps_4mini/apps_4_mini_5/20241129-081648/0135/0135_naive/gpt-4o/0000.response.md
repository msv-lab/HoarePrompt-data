To determine the correctness of the provided program, we must analyze how it adheres to the problem description.

### Problem Description Recap:
We need to check whether the remainders of dividing a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we need to identify if there exists any pair `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n mod i` equals `n mod j`.

### Given Program:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())

def func_1(n, k):
    if k >= n:
        return 'No'
    seen_remainders = set()
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        remainder = n % i
        if remainder in seen_remainders:
            return 'No'
        seen_remainders.add(remainder)
    return 'Yes'
print(func_1(n, k))
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Immediate Check**: The condition `if k >= n:` checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If true, it returns 'No'. This is incorrect because when `k >= n`, we can still have distinct remainders depending on the values of `k` and `n`.

   - **Counterexample**: Let `n = 5` and `k = 5`. We have:
     - `5 mod 1 = 0`
     - `5 mod 2 = 1`
     - `5 mod 3 = 2`
     - `5 mod 4 = 1`
     - `5 mod 5 = 0`
     Here, the remainders are not distinct (`0` and `1` repeat).
   
2. **Distinct Remainders Check**: The loop iterates from `1` to `k`, computes the remainder, and stores it in `seen_remainders`. If a duplicate is found, it returns 'No'. This part is correctly implemented for detecting duplicates.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program incorrectly assumes all cases where `k >= n` will lead to 'No', we found a counterexample where this assumption fails. 

Thus, the program does not correctly handle all cases outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **False**.
