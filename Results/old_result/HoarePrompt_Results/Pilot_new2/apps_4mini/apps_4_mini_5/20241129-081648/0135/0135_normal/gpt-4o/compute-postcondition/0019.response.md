The value of `remainder` is added to the set `seen_remainders`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n`, `i` is `k + 1`, `remainder` is `n % (k + 1)`, and `seen_remainders` now includes the value of `remainder`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` < `n`, `i` is `k + 1`, `remainder` is `n % (k + 1)`, and `remainder` is added to `seen_remainders`.**
