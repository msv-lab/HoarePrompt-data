The `seen` variable is initialized as an empty set. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial conditions along with the updated state of `seen`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an input integer where 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `seen` is an empty set.**
