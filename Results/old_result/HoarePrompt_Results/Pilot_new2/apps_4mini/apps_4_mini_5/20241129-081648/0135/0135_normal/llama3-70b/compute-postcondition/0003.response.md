The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `i` is 1. Since any number modulo 1 is 0, `remainder` will always be 0 regardless of the value of `n`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0**.
