Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `n + 2`, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is a list containing `n + 2` elements, if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
