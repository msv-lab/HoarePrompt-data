According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, the list must contain at least 3 values. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 2 values, and `result` is the second element in `results`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 3 values. Since the loop iterates over each element in `results`, the next element `result` will be the third element in the list.

State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing at least 3 values, `result` is the third element in `results`**
