Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing values based on the calculations for each test case processed, where each `results[i]` corresponds to the i-th test case processed. For each test case, `n` is the positive integer from `data[index]`, `x` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, and `s` is the binary string from `data[index + 2]`. If `balance` is equal to 0 for a test case, `results` contains `-1` if `x` is in `prefix_balances` for that test case; otherwise, it contains `0`. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `results` contains the count of valid `b` values from `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. After all iterations, `index` is equal to the final position after processing all test cases.**
