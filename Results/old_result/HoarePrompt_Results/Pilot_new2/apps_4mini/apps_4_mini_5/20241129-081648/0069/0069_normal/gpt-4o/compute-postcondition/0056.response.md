The code `results.append(-1)` adds the value `-1` to the list `results`. Since there are no changes to the existing values of the other variables, the output state will reflect the addition to the `results` list.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance values up to `n`, `prefix_balances[n]` is equal to `balance`, the current value of `balance` is 0, `x` is an element in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now contains `-1` appended to it.**
