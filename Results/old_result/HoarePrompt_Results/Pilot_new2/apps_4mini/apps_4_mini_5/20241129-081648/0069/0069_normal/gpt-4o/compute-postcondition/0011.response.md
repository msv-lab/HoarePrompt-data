The variable `prefix_balances` is assigned a list that contains `n + 1` zeros, where `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state includes the initialization of `prefix_balances` as a list of zeros of length `n + 1`.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is equal to the count of '0's in `s` minus the count of '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 1` zeros.**
