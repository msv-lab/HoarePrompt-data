Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `prefix_balances` contains cumulative balance values up to `n`, `prefix_balances[n]` is equal to `balance`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 1 if `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.***
