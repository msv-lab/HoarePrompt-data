Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0 but reduced to indicate one less iteration; `n` is a positive integer input; `x` is an input integer within the specified range; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`; `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. Otherwise, if `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, -1 is printed. If not, the output printed from the calculation is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`.***
