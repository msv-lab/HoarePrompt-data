The value of `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The value of `index` is 1, so this means `s` will take the value of `data[3]`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is the integer value of `data[1]`, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list.**
