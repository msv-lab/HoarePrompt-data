The code `results.append(-1)` appends the value `-1` to the list `results`. The previous values of the variables are unaffected by this operation. The state of `results` has been updated to include `-1`.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is non-negative, `i` is `n + 1`, `prefix_balances` is a list where `prefix_balances[k]` is the balance computed from the first `k` characters of `s`, with `prefix_balances[n]` equal to `balance + prefix_balances[0]`, the current value of `balance` is 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, and `results` has been updated to include -1.**
