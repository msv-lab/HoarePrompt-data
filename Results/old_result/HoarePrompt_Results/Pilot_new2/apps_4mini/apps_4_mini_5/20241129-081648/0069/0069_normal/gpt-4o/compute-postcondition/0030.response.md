Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is `n + 1`, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is a list containing `n + 1` elements, `count` is 1 if the value of `x - b` is divisible by `balance` and `(x - b) // balance` is greater than or equal to 0; otherwise, `count` remains 0, and the state of other variables remains unchanged.***
