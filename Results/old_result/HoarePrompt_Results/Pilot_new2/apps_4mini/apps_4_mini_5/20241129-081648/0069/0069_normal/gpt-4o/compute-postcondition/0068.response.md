Postcondition: ***`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `prefix_balances` contains cumulative balance values up to `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is 2 if `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance`, otherwise the condition does not hold.***
