The code prints the value of `result`, which is the second element in the list `results`. The variable `result` remains unchanged, and there are no modifications to the other variables. The state of `T` and `results` is still valid after the execution.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing at least 2 values, `result` is the second element in `results` and it has been printed.**
