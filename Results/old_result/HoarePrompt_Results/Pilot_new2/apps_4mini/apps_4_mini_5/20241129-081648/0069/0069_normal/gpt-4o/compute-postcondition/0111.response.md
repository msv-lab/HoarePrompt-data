According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. The loop will execute if there are values in the `results` list. Since `results` is populated based on the test cases processed, we need to ensure that at least one test case has been processed and thus at least one result is present.

1. Since `results` is a list that corresponds to the calculations for each test case processed, for the loop to execute, `results` must contain at least one element.
2. The variable `result` will be the current result from the `results` list during each iteration. Before the loop starts, since it is the first execution, it will be the first value in `results`.

Therefore, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `results` contains at least 1 result, and `result` will be the first element in `results`.

State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `results` is a list containing at least 1 value, `result` is the first element in `results**
