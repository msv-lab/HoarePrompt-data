The code `results.append(0)` adds the value `0` to the `results` list. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative balance values up to `n`, `prefix_balances[n]` is equal to `balance`, the current value of `balance` is 0, `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, and `results` now contains an additional `0`.
