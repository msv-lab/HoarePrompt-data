Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n + k` where `k` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances`, `prefix_balances` contains cumulative balance values up to `n + k`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is equal to the number of times `(x - b)` is a non-negative multiple of `balance` for each `b` in `prefix_balances`.**
