Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0 and decreased by 1. `n` is an input positive integer, `x` is an input integer within the specified range, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1` and is unchanged. If (x - balance) is divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), the program's state remains the same. Otherwise, the result is calculated as (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1.***
