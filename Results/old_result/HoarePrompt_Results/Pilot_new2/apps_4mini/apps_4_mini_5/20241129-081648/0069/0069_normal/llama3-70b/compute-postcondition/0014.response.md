Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, and `x` is an input integer within the specified range. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the function outputs `n + 1`. If `balance` is not equal to `x`, and if `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the printed output is the value of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1.***
