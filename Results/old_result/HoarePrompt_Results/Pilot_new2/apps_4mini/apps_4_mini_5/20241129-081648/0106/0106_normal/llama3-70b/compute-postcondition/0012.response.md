To evaluate the impact of the code on the program, we need to consider the output of the `print` statement, which combines `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.

The variables `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` are calculated based on the given conditions. The calculation of `min_block_time` involves finding the minimum block distance between `a_block` and `b_block` and scaling it by 15. The calculation of `min_floor_time` depends on the relationship between `a_floor` and `b_floor`.

The initial values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers, and based on their calculations:
- `a_floor` and `b_floor` are computed using the modulus operation with `m`.
- `a_block` and `b_block` are determined by integer division.

The calculated values of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` are printed as a single output.

Therefore, since the exact numeric values for `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` are not provided in the initial state, we retain the general expressions for these variables.

The output state will reflect the calculations made, including the calculated `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers; `a` and `b` are integers equal to the first and second input values respectively; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1`; `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1`; `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `b_block` is equal to `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `min_block_time` is equal to `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`; `min_floor_time` is equal to `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10` if `a_floor > b_floor`, else `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`; the printed result is `min_block_time + min_floor_time`.**
