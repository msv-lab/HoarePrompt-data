Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic required by the problem description for all potential cases. 

Here are the key issues with the implementation:

1. **Incorrect Calculation of Blocks and Floors**: 
    - The calculation for `a_block` and `b_block` uses the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, which assumes that the apartment numbers are organized sequentially by each block. However, the correct formula should consider the total number of apartments per block (which is `m * k`), and therefore, the correct logic should have been something like `((a - 1) // k) // m + 1` for blocks. This leads to incorrect identification of Edward's and Natasha's blocks.

2. **Incorrect Time Calculation**:
    - The calculation of `min_floor_time` incorrectly adds a constant time of `10` seconds to both upward and downward movements based on the condition `if (a_floor > b_floor)`. This incorrectly assumes that an elevator call is always needed, which is not the case if the two apartments are on the same floor or within floors connected by the elevator. 
    - The actual logic should consider if using the stairs or the elevator is faster based on their relative positions.

3. **Missing Direction Consideration**:
    - The implementation does not evaluate all possible paths Edward might take around the building, including both clockwise and counter-clockwise directions. It only calculates time based on the absolute difference between blocks, which does not always yield the minimum time since the building is circular.

Due to these reasons, the program may yield incorrect results for various inputs, and thus does not correctly implement the travel time calculations as described in the problem statement.
