To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze how it implements the logic described in the problem statement. The key elements to consider are:

1. **Extracting the location of apartments**: The function `get_location(apartment)` should correctly compute the block ( подъезд) and floor ( этаж) for a given apartment number. The calculation seems accurate based on the provided formulas.

2. **Calculating the time to exit the apartment**: The program considers the time it takes to use the elevator (10 seconds waiting + time to ascend or descend).

3. **Walking time between blocks**: The program considers both direct and reverse walking times. Given the circular nature of the building, it uses the modulo operator to correctly compute the distances.

4. **Traveling to the target floor**: The program calculates the time required to reach the desired floor after reaching the correct block.

Now, let's consider any edge cases or potential flaws:

### Edge Cases:
- **Case when both apartments are on the first floor**: In this scenario, `time_to_exit` should be `0`, and the walking time should be calculated directly.
- **Case when `a` is at the last apartment of a block and `b` is at the first apartment of the next block**: This situation should be handled efficiently with the modulo arithmetic for walking time.
- **Case when the two apartments are in the same block but on different floors**: The time should account for the time taken to go up or down.

### Analysis of correctness:
1. The calculation of blocks and floors seems to work correctly, as the program uses the provided formulas accurately.
2. The walking time calculation correctly considers both directions (clockwise and counterclockwise).
3. The time calculation for moving to the target floor also appears to be implemented correctly.

However, after reviewing the code closely, I noticed the following potential miscalculation:

- **Incorrect calculation of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`**: The code calculates the distance in blocks but does not correctly handle the case where `block_a` and `block_b` are equal. In this case, the walking time should be `0`, and the program incorrectly computes it as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`, which will always yield `0` when they are equal, but that means no walking time should be added. 

Given that the program does not correctly handle the walking time when both apartments are in the same block, the result can be incorrect for some inputs.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**.

The program fails to account for the case when both Edward and Natasha live in the same block, where the walking time should be `0` and it incorrectly uses the walking time formula, leading to potentially wrong overall time calculation.
