To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we need to analyze the variables affected by the operation:

- `time_to_exit` is known based on the value of `floor_a`:
  - If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0.
  - Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is equal to 10 + (floor_a - 1).

- `min_walk_time` is determined by the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`:
  - `direct_walk_time` is given by `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`.
  - `reverse_walk_time` is given by `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`.

- `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.

The final computation is:
```
total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor
```

Now, let's summarize the changes in the output state:

1. `total_time` is calculated based on the values of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, which will remain dependent on their previously defined values.
2. The new value for `total_time` will be updated accordingly.

Therefore, the output state reflects the known values of the variables that have not changed and provides the definition of the newly computed variable `total_time`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k and 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k (a ≠ b); `floor_a` is known, if `floor_a` is equal to 1 then `time_to_exit` is 0, else `time_to_exit` is equal to 10 + (floor_a - 1); `direct_walk_time` is equal to abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is equal to (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is equal to min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time); `time_to_target_floor` is equal to (floor_b - 1) * 5; `total_time` is equal to `time_to_exit` + `min_walk_time` + `time_to_target_floor`.**
