The function `func_1` accepts the following parameters: 

- `n`: a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 1000)
- `m`: a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ 1000)
- `k`: a positive integer (1 ≤ k ≤ 1000)
- `a`: an integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k
- `b`: an integer such that 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b

After executing the function body, the program returns `total_time`, which is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, calculated based on the specific values of `floor_a`, `block_a`, `block_b`, and `floor_b`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and return the computed `total_time` based on the calculations involving the specified values related to the blocks and floors. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k (positive integers) and a, b (integers with constraints on their values), and returns total_time which is the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor based on given calculations.**
