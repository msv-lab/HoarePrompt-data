To determine the output state, let's analyze the code and how it impacts the initial state.

1. **Initial State**: 
   - `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, m, k \leq 1000\)
   - `a` and `b` are integers such that \(1 \leq a \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\) and \(1 \leq b \leq n \cdot m \cdot k\) (where \(a \neq b\))
   - If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise `time_to_exit` is equal to \(10 + (floor_a - 1)\) which is greater than or equal to 11.
   - `direct_walk_time` is equal to \( \text{abs}(block_a - block_b) \% n \cdot 15\)
   - `reverse_walk_time` is equal to \((n - \text{abs}(block_a - block_b)) \% n \cdot 15\)

2. **Code Execution**:
   - `min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)` calculates the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The execution of this line does not change the values of any variables directly, but it introduces a new variable `min_walk_time` which holds the minimum of the two calculated walk times.

**Output State**: 
- The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `floor_a`, `time_to_exit`, `direct_walk_time`, and `reverse_walk_time` remain unchanged. 
- The new variable `min_walk_time` is introduced as the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k and 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k (a ≠ b); `floor_a` is known, and if `floor_a` is equal to 1 then `time_to_exit` is 0, else `time_to_exit` is equal to 10 + (floor_a - 1); `direct_walk_time` is equal to abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is equal to (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is equal to min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)**.
