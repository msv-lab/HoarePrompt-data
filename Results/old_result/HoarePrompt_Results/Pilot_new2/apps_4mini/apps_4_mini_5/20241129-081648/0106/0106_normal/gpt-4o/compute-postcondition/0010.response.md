Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ n·m·k and 1 ≤ b ≤ n·m·k (a ≠ b); `floor_a` is known, if `floor_a` is equal to 1 then `time_to_exit` is 0, else `time_to_exit` is equal to 10 + (floor_a - 1); `direct_walk_time` is equal to abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15; `reverse_walk_time` is equal to (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is equal to min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time); `time_to_target_floor` is equal to (floor_b - 1) * 5.**
