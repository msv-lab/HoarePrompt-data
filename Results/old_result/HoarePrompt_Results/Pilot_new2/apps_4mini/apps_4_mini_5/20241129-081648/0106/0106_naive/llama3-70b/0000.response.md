Correctness: **False**.

The program contains logical errors in calculating the block and floor times. Specifically, the calculation for `a_block` and `b_block` is incorrect. They use the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, which does not accurately determine the entrance (block) based on the total number of floors and apartments.

For instance, if `n = 4`, `m = 10`, and `k = 5`, the apartment numbers should be divided across the four blocks (entrances) based on the total number of apartments per entrance (`m * k`), which is `10 * 5 = 50`. The correct formula for determining the block should be `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, but the calculation of `a_block` and `b_block` does not take into account the correct number of apartments per entrance or the correct index.

Additionally, the way the program calculates the minimum time to switch blocks does not consider all scenarios, such as when moving counter-clockwise or when the starting and ending apartments are on the same floor.

An example case where the program fails could be:
- Input: `4 2 2` (4 entrances, 2 floors, 2 apartments per floor) and `a = 1` (entrance 1, floor 1, apartment 1) and `b = 8` (entrance 4, floor 2, apartment 2).
- Expected output: The correct path would take into account the need to go down to the first floor, traverse three blocks, and then go up a floor, but the program's logic does not handle this correctly. 

Therefore, because of these issues, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description in all cases.
