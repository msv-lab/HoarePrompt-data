The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. `apartment` is an integer such that 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k, where n, m, and k are also integers within the range of 1 to 1000. The function calculates two values: `block` and `floor`. The `block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and the `floor` is calculated as floor_within_block // k + 1, where floor_within_block is derived from the remaining apartments within the identified block. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return its corresponding `block` and `floor` based on the provided calculation method.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment and returns the block and floor of the apartment based on the given calculations.**
