To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic against the problem description and see if it handles all potential cases correctly.

### Key Points from the Problem Description:
1. **Apartment Numbering**: Apartments are numbered from 1 to \( n \cdot m \cdot k \). Their locations depend on the block ( подъезд ), floor, and apartments per floor.
2. **Travel times**:
   - Moving between floors takes 5 seconds.
   - Moving between entrance doors takes 15 seconds.
   - The elevator takes 10 seconds to arrive and 1 second per floor.
3. **Movement Direction**: Edward can choose to walk around the building either clockwise or counter-clockwise.

### Analyzing the Code:
1. **Get Location Function**: The code correctly calculates the block ( подъезд ) and floor of the given apartment numbers using integer division and modulo operations.
2. **Exit Time Calculation**: 
   - If Edward is on the first floor, there's no exit time.
   - If he is on other floors, he waits for the elevator (10 seconds) plus the time taken to descend to the first floor.
3. **Walking Time Calculation**:
   - The walking time is calculated for both directions (clockwise and counter-clockwise) and the minimum is taken.
4. **Final Calculation**: The total time combines the time to exit, minimum walking time, and time to reach the target floor.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Same Floor, Different Entrances**: If Edward and Natasha are on the same floor but in different blocks, he should only need to walk between entrances, which should be 15 seconds.
2. **Different Blocks, Same Floor**: If both are in different blocks but on the first floor, Edward can walk directly to Natasha without using the elevator.
3. **Boundaries**: The code does not check if the apartments \( a \) and \( b \) are at the start or end of the blocks, which could lead to incorrect calculations for walking time, especially when \( n = 1 \).

### Test Case:
Consider an edge case where \( n = 1, m = 1, k = 1 \):
- Input: `1 1 1` (one block, one floor, one apartment)
- \( a = 1, b = 2 \) is impossible since there is only one apartment.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to consider cases where Edward and Natasha might end up needing to calculate times when there are no valid apartments, and also does not accurately handle the walking time if they are on the first floor in different blocks where he could walk directly. 

**Correctness: False**. 

The program does not correctly account for all inputs as specified in the problem description, particularly when considering the boundaries of the apartment numbers and the walking time between blocks when both are on the first floor.
