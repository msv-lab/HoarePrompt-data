The code `r_queue.append(r_index + n)` appends the value of `r_index + n` to the `r_queue`. 

Before this line of code is executed:
- `n` is an integer between 1 and 200000.
- `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`.
- The previous state of `r_queue` has one less element, and this operation adds a new value derived from the current `r_index` and `n`.

After executing the code:
- `r_queue` will now contain an additional element which is `r_index + n`.
  
The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` contains at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'; `d_queue` contains one less element; `r_queue` has one less element and now includes the new value `r_index + n`; `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`.**
