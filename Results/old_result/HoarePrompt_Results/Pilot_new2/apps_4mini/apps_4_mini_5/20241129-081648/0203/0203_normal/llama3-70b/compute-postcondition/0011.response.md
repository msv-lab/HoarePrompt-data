The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The initial state does not provide a specific value for `depublicans`, so the output state will reflect that `depublicans` has increased by 1 but will not specify its exact value. The states of the other variables (`n` and `fractions`) are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n`; `depublicans` has increased by 1.**
