The function accepts an integer `n` followed by a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It processes this string to simulate a voting mechanism where votes represented by 'D' and 'R' are compared based on their indices. The function determines the final winner after pairing votes: if there are remaining 'D' votes, it prints 'D'; if there are remaining 'R' votes, it prints 'R'. This function does not handle cases where `n` is less than 1 or where the input string may contain characters other than 'D' or 'R', and it assumes valid input as per the provided constraints.
