The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from the `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. Since `r_queue` must contain at least one element according to the initial state, after executing this code, `r_queue` will have one less element, and `r_index` will hold the value of the element that was removed. The values of `n`, `votes`, `d_queue`, and `d_index` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` contains at least one 'D' and at least one 'R'; `d_queue` contains one less element; `r_queue` has one less element and `r_index` is the first element that was in `r_queue`.**
