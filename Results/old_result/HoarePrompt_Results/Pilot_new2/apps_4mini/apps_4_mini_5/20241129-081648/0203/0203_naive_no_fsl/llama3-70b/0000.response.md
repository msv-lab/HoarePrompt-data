Correctness: **False**

The provided program incorrectly determines the outcome of the voting based solely on the count of employees from each fraction without simulating the voting and denial process described in the problem statement. 

A counterexample where the program fails is as follows:

Input:
```
3
DRD
```

In this scenario:
- Employee 1 (D) votes and can deny Employee 2 (R).
- Employee 3 (D) can also vote.
- If Employee 1 denies Employee 2, then Employee 3 can deny Employee 1 in the next round.

The actual outcome should be determined by the optimal strategy of the employees, but the program will incorrectly output 'D' since there are 2 D's and 1 R in the string, without considering the denial and voting rounds that could lead to a different outcome.

Thus, the program does not adhere to the requirements of the problem as it doesn't account for the strategic denial of votes, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
