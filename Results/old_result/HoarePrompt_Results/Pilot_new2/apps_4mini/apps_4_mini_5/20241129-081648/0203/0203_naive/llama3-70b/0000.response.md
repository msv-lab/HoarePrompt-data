Correctness: **False**.

The program simply counts the number of 'D' (depublicans) and 'R' (remocrats) and declares the winner based on which count is greater. However, the problem description specifies a complex voting procedure where employees can deny others the right to vote and that these actions affect the outcome. The program does not take into account the dynamic nature of the voting process described, where employees can deny others from voting, potentially leading to different outcomes than just counting the initial number of each faction. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5
DRDRD
```
In this case, if the first employee denies the fifth employee from voting, the voting process continues with the remaining employees potentially denying each other, leading to different outcomes than simply counting the initial votes. 

Thus, the program fails to correctly simulate the voting process as described, and therefore is incorrect.
