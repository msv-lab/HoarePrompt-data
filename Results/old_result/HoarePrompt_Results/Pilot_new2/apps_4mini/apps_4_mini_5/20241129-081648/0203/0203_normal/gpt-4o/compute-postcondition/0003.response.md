The variable `r_queue` is assigned an empty list `[]`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `votes`, and `d_queue`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the new state of `r_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' without leading or trailing whitespace; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list.**
