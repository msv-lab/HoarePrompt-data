`votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, where `input()` accepts a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and `strip()` removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The value of `n` remains unchanged as an integer between 1 and 200000. The output state reflects the new assignment of `votes`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' without leading or trailing whitespace.**
