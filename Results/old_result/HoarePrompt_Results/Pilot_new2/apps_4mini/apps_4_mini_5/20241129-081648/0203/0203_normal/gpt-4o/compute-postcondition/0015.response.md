The code `d_queue.append(i)` appends the value of `i` to the list or queue `d_queue`. The value of `i` is previously defined as `k + 2`, and since `k + 2 < n`, this means `i` is a valid integer value within the constraints of the problem. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state maintains all previously defined variables, but now includes the new element added to `d_queue`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 200000; `votes` is a string of length `n`; `i` is `k + 2`; `v` is the character at index `k + 2` in `votes`; `d_queue` now contains the value `i` appended to it.**
