Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when both `a` and `b` are entirely made up of leading zeros, such as `0000` and `0000`. When the program strips the leading zeros, both `a` and `b` would result in empty strings. The comparison of empty strings will produce incorrect results since `'' < ''` is `False`, `'' > ''` is also `False`, and `'' == ''` is `True`. Thus, the program will incorrectly print `'='` for two zero values (which is correct), but it will fail to handle any other scenario where leading zeroes are significant for comparison.

The function implementation needs to ensure that the inputs are compared properly, even when they are stripped of leading zeros. Specifically, the program should handle the cases where both numbers become empty after removing leading zeros and treat them as equal. 

Additionally, while using `input().lstrip('0')` is valid for removing leading zeros, it doesn't account for the situation where the entire string is just zeros, which may cause issues in the comparison logic.

In summary, the program does not handle leading zeros correctly in all scenarios, especially when both inputs are zero or consist entirely of zeros. This leads to potentially incorrect output for certain edge cases.
