The code snippet provided only contains a `print` statement, which outputs a string but does not change the state of any variables. The values of `a` and `b` remain the same as they were initially defined. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print operation has occurred but does not affect the values of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer with leading zeros removed, `b` is '0' if it was originally empty, or retains its value if not empty. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`, `a` is equal to `b`, and '=' has been printed.**
