The code `print('<')` outputs the character `<`, but does not alter any values of the variables `a` or `b`. The conditions mentioned in the initial state regarding `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the print statement does not affect their states. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a string representing a non-negative integer with leading zeros removed, `b` is either empty or its value remains unchanged, if `b` is empty it is set to '0', and if `a` was originally empty, it is also set to '0', and the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer with leading zeros removed, `b` is either empty or its value remains unchanged, if `b` is empty it is set to '0', and if `a` was originally empty, it is also set to '0', and the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`.**
