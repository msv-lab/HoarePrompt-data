The code snippet `print('>')` does not modify any variables or the state of the program. It simply outputs a character '>' to the console. Therefore, the values of the variables remain unchanged, but the output indicates the program printed the character.

Output State: **`a` is a string representing a non-negative integer with leading zeros removed, `b` is '0' if it was originally empty, or retains its value if not empty. The length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`. `a` is greater than `b` and '>' has been printed to the console.**
