The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, which can each contain up to 10^6 digits and may include leading zeroes. The function performs some operations based on these inputs and returns a value according to the specific logic defined in its body. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integer strings, `a` and `b`, and returns a result based on operations performed on these strings.**
