To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the requirements and the implementation.

### Problem Analysis:
1. **Input**: Two integers `x` (starting side length) and `y` (target side length) such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`.
2. **Output**: A single integer representing the minimum seconds required to transform the triangle from side length `x` to `y` while maintaining a non-degenerate triangle.

### Operations Allowed:
- In a single second, Memory can modify the length of a single side of the triangle.
- The triangle must remain non-degenerate, which means the lengths of the sides must remain positive and satisfy the triangle inequality.

### Program Analysis:
The program provided is:
```python
def func():
    x, y = map(int, input().split())
    print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

### Breakdown of the Program Logic:
- It takes `x` and `y` as input and computes `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`.
- This computes the number of seconds required to reduce the side length from `x` to `y`.

### Correctness Check:
1. **Understanding the Calculation**:
   - The expression `(x - y) // 2` calculates how many full operations can be performed by reducing two sides of the triangle at a time.
   - The expression `(x - y) % 2` checks if there is an additional operation needed for the odd difference (i.e., if `x - y` is odd, you will need one additional second to make the final adjustment).

2. **Possible Cases**:
   - If `x = 6` and `y = 3`: 
     - `6 - 3 = 3`, which is odd. Operations would be 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2. 
     - However, in reality it requires 4 seconds.
   - If `x = 8` and `y = 5`: 
     - `8 - 5 = 3`, which is odd. Operations would be 3 // 2 + 3 % 2 = 1 + 1 = 2. 
     - Reality requires 3 seconds.
   - If `x = 22` and `y = 4`: 
     - `22 - 4 = 18`, which is even. Operations would be 18 // 2 + 18 % 2 = 9 + 0 = 9.
     - Reality requires 6 seconds.

### Conclusion:
The program does not correctly calculate the minimum number of seconds because it does not account for maintaining the non-degenerate triangle condition properly during the transition. Specifically, the logic fails to calculate the correct number of modifications required to adjust the sides without violating the triangle inequality.

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
