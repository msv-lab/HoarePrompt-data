The expression `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` calculates the number of steps needed to go from `y` to `x`, where `x` is always greater than or equal to `y`. The formula effectively counts how many pairs of steps can be taken and adds one more if there's an odd difference.

Since `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, we know `x - y` is at least 1. 

The output state will reflect the unchanged conditions and include the result of the calculation. 

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, the result is `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`.**
