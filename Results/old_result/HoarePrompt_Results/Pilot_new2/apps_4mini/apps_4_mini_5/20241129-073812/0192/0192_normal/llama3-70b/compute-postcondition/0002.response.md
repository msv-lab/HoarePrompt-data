The function `func` does not accept any explicit parameters, as indicated by the empty parentheses in its definition. However, it operates under the constraint that two integers, `x` and `y`, must be provided with the conditions that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Given this context, we can summarize the functionality based on the accepted constraints.

Functionality: **The function requires two integers, `x` and `y`, such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, but the specific return value or behavior of the function is not provided.**
