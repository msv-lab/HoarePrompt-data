The variables `x` and `y` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, which will give them integer values. The precondition states that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, meaning `y` must always be less than `x`, and both must satisfy the given bounds. However, since `input` will provide new values for `x` and `y`, the exact values cannot be determined from the initial state.

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer**
