To determine the impact of the code snippet on the initial state, we analyze the provided information:

- `total_days` is equal to \( 2^n \).
- `denominator` is initially 1.
- `MOD` is 1000003.

The code performs the operation:
```
denominator = denominator * total_days % MOD
```

We can break this down as follows:
1. The current value of `denominator` is 1.
2. The value of `total_days` is \( 2^n \).
3. The new value of `denominator` is calculated by taking the product of its current value (1) and `total_days`, and then taking the result modulo `MOD` (1000003).

Thus, the new value of `denominator` will be:
\[
denominator = (1 * (2^n)) \% 1000003 = (2^n) \% 1000003
\]

Since `n` is within the range \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \), the output state will accurately reflect the changes to `denominator`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the final output state is:
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to 2^n; `numerator` is (2^n) % 1000003; `denominator` is equal to (2^n) % 1000003; `i` is 0.**
