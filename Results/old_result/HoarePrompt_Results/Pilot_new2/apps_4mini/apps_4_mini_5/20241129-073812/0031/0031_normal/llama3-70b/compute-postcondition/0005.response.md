The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days`. Given that `total_days` is 2 and `denominator` is initially 1, the new value of `denominator` becomes 1 * 2 = 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 2, `i` is 0, `k` is at least 2.

Output State: **`total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 2, `i` is 0, `k` is at least 2**
