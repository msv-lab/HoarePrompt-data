The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`. Given that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), the value of `total_days` will be a power of 2, specifically \(2^{n}\). Other variables are not affected, so their states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to `2 ** n`.**
