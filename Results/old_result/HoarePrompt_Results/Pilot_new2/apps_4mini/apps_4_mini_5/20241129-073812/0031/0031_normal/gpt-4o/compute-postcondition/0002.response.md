The code snippet `print(1, 1)` outputs the values `1` and `1`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `MOD` remain unchanged and retain their previous values as there are no assignments or modifications to them in the code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and the output is (1, 1).**
