The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days`. Given that `denominator` is initially 2 and `total_days` is 2, the updated value of `denominator` becomes 2 * 2 = 4. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 4, `i` is 1, `k` must be at least 2**
