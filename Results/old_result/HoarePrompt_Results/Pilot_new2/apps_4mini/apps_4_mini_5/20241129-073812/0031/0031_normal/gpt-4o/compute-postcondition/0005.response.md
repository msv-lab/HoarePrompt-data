The variable `total_days` is assigned the value of `1 << n`, which is equivalent to 2 raised to the power of `n` (i.e., `2^n`). Given that `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), `total_days` will be equal to \(2^n\). The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and `k` is less than or equal to 1 shifted left by `n` (k ≤ 2^n), `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to 2^n.**
