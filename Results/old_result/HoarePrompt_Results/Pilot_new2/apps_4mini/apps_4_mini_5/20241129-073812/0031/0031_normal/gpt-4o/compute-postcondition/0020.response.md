To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to first compute the values of `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, and then subsequently `p_shared`.

1. **Calculate `total_days`**: 
   - `total_days` is equal to \( 2^n \).
 
2. **Calculate `numerator`**:
   - `numerator` is equal to the product of \( (2^n) \times (2^n - 1) \times \ldots \times (2^n - (k - 1)) \mod 1000003 \).

3. **Calculate `denominator`**:
   - `denominator` is equal to \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \).
 
4. **Calculate `p_no_shared`**:
   - `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`.

5. **Calculate `p_total`**:
   - `p_total` is equal to \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \).

6. **Calculate `p_shared`**:
   - `p_shared` is computed with the formula: 
   \[
   p\_shared = (p\_total - p\_no\_shared + MOD) \mod MOD
   \]

Now, substituting the values into the output state:

- We have computed `total_days`, `numerator`, `denominator`, `p_no_shared`, and `p_total`.
- The value of `p_shared` is derived from `p_total` and `p_no_shared`.

The state of the variables after the execution of the code is as follows:

- `n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \)
- `k` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^{18} \)
- `MOD` is \( 1000003 \)
- `total_days` is equal to \( 2^n \)
- `numerator` is equal to the product of \( (2^n) \times (2^n - 1) \times \ldots \times (2^n - (k - 1)) \mod 1000003 \)
- `denominator` is equal to \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \)
- `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`
- `p_total` is equal to \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \)
- `p_shared` is equal to \( (p\_total - p\_no\_shared + 1000003) \mod 1000003 \)

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{18} \); `k` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq k \leq 10^{18} \); `MOD` is \( 1000003 \); `total_days` is equal to \( 2^n \); `numerator` is equal to the product of \( (2^n) \times (2^n - 1) \times \ldots \times (2^n - (k - 1)) \mod 1000003 \); `denominator` is equal to \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \); `p_no_shared` is equal to `numerator`; `p_total` is equal to \( (2^n)^k \mod 1000003 \); `p_shared` is equal to \( (p\_total - p\_no\_shared + 1000003) \mod 1000003**.
