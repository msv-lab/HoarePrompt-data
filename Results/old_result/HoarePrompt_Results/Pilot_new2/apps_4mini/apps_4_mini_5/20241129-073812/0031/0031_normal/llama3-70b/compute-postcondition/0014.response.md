The value of `numerator` is updated by performing an integer division by `gcd`. Given that `numerator` is 0 and `gcd` is equal to `2^k`, the result of `numerator //= gcd` will be 0, since any number divided by a non-zero number is still 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`numerator` is 0, `denominator` is `2^k`, `k` is at least 2, `gcd` is equal to `2^k`**
