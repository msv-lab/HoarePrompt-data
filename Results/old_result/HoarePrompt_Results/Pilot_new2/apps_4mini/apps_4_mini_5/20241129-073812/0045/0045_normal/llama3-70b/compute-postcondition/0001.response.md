The code assigns the values of `b` to `a` and the result of `a % b` to `b`. Given that `a` is a positive integer representing the sum `n` and `b` is a positive integer representing the count `k`, we have:

- `a` takes the value of `b`, which is a positive integer so `a` becomes `k`.
- `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`, where `a` was the original sum `n` before the assignment. Since both `a` and `b` are positive integers, `a % b` will yield a non-negative integer less than `b`.

Therefore, the Output State will reflect that `a` is now equal to `b` (which was previously `k`), and `b` is now equal to the value of `n % k`.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer equal to `k`; `b` is a positive integer equal to `n % k`.**
