In the given code, `a` and `b` are reassigned with new values based on their previous states. The variable `a` will take the value of `b`, and `b` will take the value of `a % b`. Given the initial conditions, we can analyze the changes:

1. `a` is initially equal to `n % k`.
2. `b` is initially equal to `k % (n % k)` and must be non-zero.

After executing the code `a, b = b, a % b`:
- `a` will be assigned the value of `b`, which is `k % (n % k)`.
- `b` will be assigned the value of `a % b`, which is `(n % k) % b`.

Now, since `b` is non-zero and we know `a = n % k` and `b = k % (n % k)`, we can conclude the following:

1. `a` now equals `k % (n % k)`.
2. `b` now equals `(n % k) % (k % (n % k))`.

Thus, the output state reflects the updated values of `a` and `b` while retaining the conditions of the initial state.

Output State: **`a` is equal to `k % (n % k)`; `b` is equal to `(n % k) % (k % (n % k))` and `b` is non-zero.**
