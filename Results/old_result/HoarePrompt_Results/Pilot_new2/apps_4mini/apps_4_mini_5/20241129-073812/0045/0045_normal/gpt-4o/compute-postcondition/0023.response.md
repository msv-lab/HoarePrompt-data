To analyze the state of the variables after all iterations of the loop, we must consider that the loop continues to execute until either the `remainder` becomes zero or all elements of the sequence have been incremented.

Given the loop code:
```python
for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
    if remainder == 0:
        break
    sequence[i] += 1
    remainder -= 1
```
This indicates that for each iteration of the loop:
- An element of `sequence` is incremented by 1.
- The `remainder` is decremented by 1.

After executing the loop fully, the following conditions will hold:
1. **If `remainder` is greater than zero after all iterations**, it indicates that there are more increments than available indices in `sequence`.
2. **The loop will execute a maximum of `k` times**, where each index in the `sequence` can be incremented exactly once before the loop exhausts its range.

Thus, if the loop executes all `k` times, we can conclude:
- The `remainder` will be reduced by `k`, and if `remainder` is initially less than `k`, it will become zero, stopping the loop.
- The `sequence` will have its last `remainder` values distributed across its elements, with the first `remainder` elements being incremented by 1.

Final state after the loop has executed completely:
- If `remainder` was initially `r`, then `sequence` will have `r` elements incremented by 1, and the rest will remain as originally calculated.
- The final value of `remainder` will be 0 since the loop will break once it hits zero.

So, the output state after all iterations of the loop is:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is 0, `sequence` is equal to `[d * (1) + (1 if i < initial_remainder else 0), d * (2) + (1 if i < initial_remainder else 0), ..., d * (k) + (1 if k - 1 < initial_remainder else 0)]`, for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`.**
