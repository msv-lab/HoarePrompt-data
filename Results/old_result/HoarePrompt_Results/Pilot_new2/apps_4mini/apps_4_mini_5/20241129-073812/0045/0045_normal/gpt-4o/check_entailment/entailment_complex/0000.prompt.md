You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: You are given positive integer number n. You should create such strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, that their sum is equal to n and greatest common divisor is maximal.

Greatest common divisor of sequence is maximum of such numbers that every element of sequence is divisible by them.

If there is no possible sequence then output -1.


-----Input-----

The first line consists of two numbers n and k (1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10).


-----Output-----

If the answer exists then output k numbers — resulting sequence. Otherwise output -1. If there are multiple answers, print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
6 3

Output
1 2 3

Input
8 2

Output
2 6

Input
5 3

Output
-1
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10.
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if (min_sum > n) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1 because the current value of min_sum is greater than n.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`.
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]
    for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
        if remainder == 0:
            break
        
        sequence[i] += 1
        
        remainder -= 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is 0, `sequence` is equal to `[d * (1) + (1 if i < initial_remainder else 0), d * (2) + (1 if i < initial_remainder else 0), ..., d * (k) + (1 if k - 1 < initial_remainder else 0)]`, for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
    return sequence
    #The program returns the sequence which is calculated based on d, k, and the initial_remainder, where each element in the sequence is defined as d * (i + 1) + (1 if i < initial_remainder else 0) for i from 0 to k-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `k`, and first checks if the minimum possible sum of the first `k` natural numbers (calculated as `min_sum`) is greater than `n`. If so, it returns -1. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function computes a sequence of `k` integers where each integer is initially `d * (i + 1)` (with `d` being the number of times `min_sum` fits into `n`), and distributes any remaining value (the `remainder`) among the last `k` elements of the sequence. The output is the computed sequence. There are no additional edge cases covered in the annotations.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
