To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's first analyze the requirements and the code.

**Problem Description Review:**
1. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximal.
3. If such a sequence cannot be formed, the output should be `-1`.

**Program Review:**
```python
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        (a, b) = (b, a % b)
    return a

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
if n < k:
    print(-1)
else:
    seq = []
    for i in range(1, k + 1):
        if n >= i:
            seq.append(i)
            n -= i
        else:
            break
    if len(seq) != k:
        print(-1)
    else:
        print(' '.join(map(str, seq)))
```

**Analysis of the Code:**
1. The program first checks if `n < k`. If true, it prints `-1` because it's impossible to form `k` positive integers that sum to `n` when `n` is less than `k`.
2. It then attempts to create a sequence of integers from `1` to `k`. It subtracts these integers from `n` and adds them to the sequence.
3. After constructing the sequence, it checks if the length of the sequence is equal to `k`. If not, it prints `-1`. Otherwise, it prints the sequence.

**Potential Issues:**
- The program only generates the sequence `{1, 2, ..., k}`. This does not ensure that the GCD of the sequence is maximal.
- The GCD will not be maximal unless the sequence is generated in a way that maximizes the common divisor. 

**Counterexample:**
Letâ€™s consider the input where `n = 10` and `k = 3`. The program will yield the sequence `1, 2, 3`. The sum is `6`, which is less than `10`. The program does not account for adjusting the last number of the sequence to ensure both conditions of sum and strictly increasing nature are met.

For a valid output, we could potentially have a sequence like `1, 2, 7` which fulfills the requirement for `n = 10` and `k = 3`. However, the current implementation does not account for this and hence does not guarantee correct behavior as per the problem statement.

**Conclusion:**
The program does not fulfill the requirement of creating a strictly increasing sequence that sums to `n` while maximizing the GCD. It fails particularly when the sequence needs to be adjusted to meet the sum requirement. 

Correctness: **False**.
