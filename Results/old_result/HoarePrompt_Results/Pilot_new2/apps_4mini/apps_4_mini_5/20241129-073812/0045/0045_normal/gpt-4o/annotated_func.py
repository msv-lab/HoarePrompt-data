    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is 0, `sequence` is equal to `[d * (1) + (1 if i < initial_remainder else 0), d * (2) + (1 if i < initial_remainder else 0), ..., d * (k) + (1 if k - 1 < initial_remainder else 0)]`, for each `i` from 0 to `k-1`.
    return sequence
    #The program returns the sequence which is calculated based on d, k, and the initial_remainder, where each element in the sequence is defined as d * (i + 1) + (1 if i < initial_remainder else 0) for i from 0 to k-1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers, `n` and `k`, and first checks if the minimum possible sum of the first `k` natural numbers (calculated as `min_sum`) is greater than `n`. If so, it returns -1. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, the function computes a sequence of `k` integers where each integer is initially `d * (i + 1)` (with `d` being the number of times `min_sum` fits into `n`), and distributes any remaining value (the `remainder`) among the last `k` elements of the sequence. The output is the computed sequence. There are no additional edge cases covered in the annotations.
