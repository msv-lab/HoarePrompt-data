The list `b` is sorted in reverse order. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged, but the order of the elements in `b` is now from highest to lowest. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 30; `m` is an integer within the range 1 to 30; `r` is an integer within the range 1 to 1000; `s` is a sorted list of `n` integers within the range 1 to 1000; `b` is a list of `m` integers sorted in reverse order.**
