Postcondition: ***`n` is between 2 and 30, `m` is between 1 and 30, and `r` is between 0 and `s[i] - 1`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `shares` is updated to `shares + (r // s[i])`, and `i` is equal to 1; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
