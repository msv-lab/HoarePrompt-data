The function accepts integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, and two lists of integers `s` and `b` representing buying and selling prices of shares, respectively. It calculates how many shares can be bought with the amount `r` based on the buying prices in `s`, and then calculates the total amount after selling those shares at the prices in `b`. Finally, it prints the resulting amount `r`. If no shares can be bought initially, the function will simply print the original value of `r`.
