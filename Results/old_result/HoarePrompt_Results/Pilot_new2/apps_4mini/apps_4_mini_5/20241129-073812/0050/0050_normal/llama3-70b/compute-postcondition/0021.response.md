The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop of the most internal structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 2 and 30, `m` is between 1 and 30, `r` is between 0 and `s[i] - 1`, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
