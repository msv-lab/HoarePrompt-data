The variable `s` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the input integers (from the user) to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. This means `s` will now contain `n` integers provided in a single line of input, separated by spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `b` remain unchanged. The initial conditions of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `b` are still valid, but we do not know the specific input values for `s` since they are provided interactively.

Output State: **`n` is the input value between 1 and 30, `m` is the input value between 1 and 30, `r` is the input value between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `n` integers (each integer is the input price provided), and `b` is a list of `m` integers (1 <= b_i <= 1000).**
