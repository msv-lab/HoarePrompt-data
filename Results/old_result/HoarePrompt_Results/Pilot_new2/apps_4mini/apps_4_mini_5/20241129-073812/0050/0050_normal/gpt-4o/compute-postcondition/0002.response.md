The variable `b` is assigned the value returned by `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which creates a list of integers from the input values. The input values for `b` are not known but they are integers between 1 and 1000, and the length of the list will be equal to the previously defined value of `m` (the input value between 1 and 30). The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the input value between 1 and 30, `m` is the input value between 1 and 30, `r` is the input value between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `n` integers (each integer is the input price provided), `b` is a list of `m` integers derived from input values between 1 and 1000.**
