The variable `remaining_bourles` is assigned the value of `r % min_buy_price`. Since `r` is an input value between 1 and 1000 and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`, which is a list of `n` integers (where `n` is between 1 and 30), the value of `remaining_bourles` will be determined by the modulus operation between these two variables. 

The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input value between 1 and 30, `m` is the input value between 1 and 30, `r` is the input value between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers between 1 and 1000, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, it is the case that `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`, `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`, and `remaining_bourles` is equal to `r % min_buy_price`.

Output State: **`n` is the input value between 1 and 30, `m` is the input value between 1 and 30, `r` is the input value between 1 and 1000, `s` is a list of `n` integers, `b` is a list of `m` integers between 1 and 1000, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, it is the case that `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`, `max_shares` is equal to `r // min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is equal to `r % min_buy_price`.**
