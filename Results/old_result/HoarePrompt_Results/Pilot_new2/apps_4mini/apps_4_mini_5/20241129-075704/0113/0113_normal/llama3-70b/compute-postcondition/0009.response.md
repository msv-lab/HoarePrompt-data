The code prints the value of `n`. Since `n` was initially a positive integer and has been incremented to become a multiple of `10`, the value of `n` that gets printed is that multiple of `10`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer and a multiple of `10`, which was incremented from a value that was not a multiple of `10`**
