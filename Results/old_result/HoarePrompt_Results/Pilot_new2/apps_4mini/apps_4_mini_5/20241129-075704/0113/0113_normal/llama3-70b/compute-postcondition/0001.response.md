`x` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 ≤ k ≤ 8`, the value of `x` will be `1`, `10`, `100`, `1000`, `10000`, `100000`, `1000000`, `10000000`, or `100000000` depending on the value of `k`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8; `x` is equal to `10 ** k`.**
