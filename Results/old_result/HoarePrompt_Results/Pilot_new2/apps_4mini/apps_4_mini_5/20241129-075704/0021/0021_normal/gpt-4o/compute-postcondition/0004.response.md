The value of `dist1` is assigned the absolute value of `0 - max_pos`. The impact of this code means that `dist1` will now hold the distance from index 0 to the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`. The values of `n`, `a`, `min_pos`, and `max_pos` remain unchanged, but `dist1` is now defined based on the value of `max_pos`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive); `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of n in list `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - max_pos)`.**
