The variable `a` is assigned the value produced by `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means `a` will now hold a list of integers based on user input. The variable `n` is the length of the list `a` and is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100. The distinct integers in `a` will be between 1 and n (inclusive).

Since the specific input for `a` is not provided, it remains a list of `n` distinct integers according to the constraints specified.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), assigned from user input.**
