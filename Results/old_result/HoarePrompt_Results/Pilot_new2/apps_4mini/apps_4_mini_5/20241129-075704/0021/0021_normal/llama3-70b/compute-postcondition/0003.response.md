The code assigns `posn` the value of the index of `n` in the list `a`. Since `n` is an integer in the range of 2 to 100 and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, the index lookup for `n` in the list `a` will yield a valid index as long as `n` is indeed an element of the list `a`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range of 2 to 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `pos1` is the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`.**
