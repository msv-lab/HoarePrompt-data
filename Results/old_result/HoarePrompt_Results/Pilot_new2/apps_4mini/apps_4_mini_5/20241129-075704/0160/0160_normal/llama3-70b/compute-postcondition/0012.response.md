Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `gcd` is equal to the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `A`, `i` is 1, and `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`. The current value of `gcd` is divisible by `i`.***
