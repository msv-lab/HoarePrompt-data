Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple containing a positive integer N (2 <= N <= 500), a non-negative integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and a list A of N integers (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6). It calculates and returns a sorted list of all divisors of N in descending order. The function does not utilize the values of K or A in its computations, which may indicate missing functionality.**
