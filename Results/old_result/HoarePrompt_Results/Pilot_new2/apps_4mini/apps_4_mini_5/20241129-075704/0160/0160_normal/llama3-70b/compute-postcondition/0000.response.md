The values of `N` and `K` are assigned based on the input received in the code, where `map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from input. Other variables such as `A` remain unchanged. The exact values of `N` and `K` will depend on the specific input provided during execution. 

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, and `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6; `N` and `K` are assigned from input values.**
