The function accepts an integer `N` (between 2 and 500), a non-negative integer `K` (less than or equal to 10^9), and a list `A` of `N` integers (each between 1 and 10^6). It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list `A` and then determines the largest divisor of this GCD. Finally, it prints the largest divisor. The function does not utilize the parameter `K`, which is irrelevant to its functionality.
