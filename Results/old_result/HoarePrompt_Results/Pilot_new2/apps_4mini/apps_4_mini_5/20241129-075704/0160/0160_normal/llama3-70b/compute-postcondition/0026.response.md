Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `gcd` must be at least 9, `i` is 3, and `max_divisor` is max(max_divisor, 3). If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, the condition holds true and the program continues processing according to the logic defined in the subsequent code.***
