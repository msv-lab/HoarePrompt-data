To determine the states that need to be adjusted at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information. The loop iterates over a range from `1` to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. 

1. **Understanding the Loop Condition**: The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. Thus, we need to ensure that the value of `i` is incremented correctly based on the previous iteration.

2. **Information from the Previous State**: At the end of the previous iteration, `i` remains 1 if `x` is divisible by `i`. Given that loops typically increment `i` at the end of each iteration, we can assume that `i` will increment in the next iteration.

3. **Next Value of `i`**: Since `i` starts at `1`, in the next iteration, `i` would be `2`.

4. **Condition on `x` for Loop Execution**: The loop will continue executing as long as `i` (now incremented to `2`) is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. Therefore, we need `int(math.sqrt(x))` to be at least `2` for the loop to execute again. This implies that `x` should be at least `4` (since `sqrt(4) = 2`).

So, summarizing these observations, we have:

State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element N is a positive integer (2 <= N <= 500), the second element K is a non-negative integer (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of N integers A (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N), `divisors` is a set that contains the values of `1` and `N`, and `i` is now 2. Also, `x` must be greater than or equal to 4 for the loop to execute again.**
