The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of `A[0]`. The initial state specifies that `A` is a list of `N` integers, and since `N` is between 2 and 500, `A[0]` will be an integer between 1 and 10^6. The other variables `N` and `K` remain unchanged. Thus, we need to reflect the value of `gcd` in the output state while keeping the other variables intact.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6; `gcd` is equal to `A[0]`.**
