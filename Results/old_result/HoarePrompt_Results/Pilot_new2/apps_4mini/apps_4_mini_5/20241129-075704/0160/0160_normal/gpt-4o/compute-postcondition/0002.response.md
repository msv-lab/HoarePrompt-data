Postcondition: ***`x` is a tuple where the first element N is a positive integer (2 <= N <= 500), the second element K is a non-negative integer (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of N integers A (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N), `divisors` is an empty set, and `i` is 1. The current value of `i` is such that `x % i` equals 0, indicating that `i` is a divisor of `x`.***
