The code `divisors.add(i)` adds the current value of `i`, which is `2`, to the set `divisors`. Since `divisors` initially contains the values `1` and `N`, after this operation, it will now also include `2`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a tuple where the first element N is a positive integer (2 <= N <= 500), the second element K is a non-negative integer (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of N integers A (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N), `divisors` is a set that now contains the values of `1`, `2`, and `N`, and `i` is still `2`.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element N is a positive integer (2 <= N <= 500), the second element K is a non-negative integer (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of N integers A (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N), `divisors` is a set that contains the values `1`, `2`, and `N`, and `i` is 2.**
