The code `divisors.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. The calculation for `i` is based on the initial state where `x` is a tuple. The first element `N` is a positive integer (between 2 and 500), and since `i` is assigned the value `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, where `x` is a tuple, it appears there may be a misunderstanding because `math.sqrt(x)` is not directly applicable to a tuple.

However, if we assume `x` is a tuple and `N` is the first element (which is a positive integer), we can interpret the execution context to correctly assign `i` using the integer value of `N`. Thus, `i` will be set as `int(math.sqrt(N)) + 1`.

The `divisors` set is updated to include the new value of `i`.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element `N` is a positive integer (2 <= N <= 500), the second element `K` is a non-negative integer (0 <= K <= 10^9), the third element is a list of `N` integers `A` (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N); `i` is `int(math.sqrt(N)) + 1`, and `divisors` now includes the value of `i`.**
