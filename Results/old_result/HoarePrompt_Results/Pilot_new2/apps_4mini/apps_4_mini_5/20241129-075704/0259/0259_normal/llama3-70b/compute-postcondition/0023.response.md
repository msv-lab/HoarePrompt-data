The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is 1, so `ans` will be 1 + 1, which equals 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000; `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d); `min_time` is equal to `time` where `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`; `ans` is 2; `i` is 1; `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`; `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000; `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d); `min_time` is equal to `time` where `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`; `ans` is 2; `i` is 1; `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`; `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`.**
