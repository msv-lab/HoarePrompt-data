You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: It is raining heavily. But this is the first day for Serval, who just became 3 years old, to go to the kindergarten. Unfortunately, he lives far from kindergarten, and his father is too busy to drive him there. The only choice for this poor little boy is to wait for a bus on this rainy day. Under such circumstances, the poor boy will use the first bus he sees no matter where it goes. If several buses come at the same time, he will choose one randomly.

Serval will go to the bus station at time $t$, and there are $n$ bus routes which stop at this station. For the $i$-th bus route, the first bus arrives at time $s_i$ minutes, and each bus of this route comes $d_i$ minutes later than the previous one.

As Serval's best friend, you wonder which bus route will he get on. If several buses arrive at the same time, you can print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $t$ ($1\leq n\leq 100$, $1\leq t\leq 10^5$) — the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. 

Each of the next $n$ lines contains two space-separated integers $s_i$ and $d_i$ ($1\leq s_i,d_i\leq 10^5$) — the time when the first bus of this route arrives and the interval between two buses of this route.


-----Output-----

Print one number — what bus route Serval will use. If there are several possible answers, you can print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2
6 4
9 5

Output
1

Input
5 5
3 3
2 5
5 6
4 9
6 1

Output
3

Input
3 7
2 2
2 3
2 4

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the first bus of the first route arrives at time $6$, and the first bus of the second route arrives at time $9$, so the first route is the answer.

In the second example, a bus of the third route arrives at time $5$, so it is the answer.

In the third example, buses of the first route come at times $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$, and so fourth, buses of the second route come at times $2$, $5$, $8$, and so fourth and buses of the third route come at times $2$, $6$, $10$, and so on, so $1$ and $2$ are both acceptable answers while $3$ is not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), t is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), and for each bus route i, s_i and d_i are positive integers (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000).
def func():
    n, t = map(int, input().split())
    buses = []
    for _ in range(n):
        s, d = map(int, input().split())
        
        buses.append((s, d))
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100, `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000, `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d) where each tuple corresponds to user input values for `s` and `d`.
    min_time = float('inf')
    ans = -1
    for (i, (s, d)) in enumerate(buses):
        time = (t - s) % d
        
        if time < min_time:
            min_time = time
            ans = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000; `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d); `min_time` is the minimum time calculated from all buses, `ans` is the index (1-based) of the bus that results in the minimum time, `i` is `n - 1`, `s` is the first element of the last tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the last tuple in `buses`. If the loop does not execute (if `n` is 0), then `min_time` remains as positive infinity, and `ans` remains -1.
    print(ans)
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` (number of bus routes) and `t` (current time), collects `n` tuples of bus route parameters `(s_i, d_i)`, calculates the minimum wait time for the buses, and prints the 1-based index of the bus that results in the minimum wait time. If there are no bus routes, it would print -1.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
