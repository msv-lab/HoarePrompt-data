The variable `buses` is initialized as an empty list. The initial states of `n` and `t` remain unchanged because they are not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the input integer within the range 1 to 100, `t` is the input integer within the range 1 to 100000, and `buses` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is the input integer within the range 1 to 100, `t` is the input integer within the range 1 to 100000, `buses` is an empty list.**
