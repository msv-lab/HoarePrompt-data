The value of `wait_time` is assigned the expression `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Based on the initial state, `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][0]` and `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][1]`. The values of `n`, `i`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][0]`; `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][1]`; `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`; `min_wait_time` is updated to equal `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is set to 2.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 2; `i` is 2; `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][0]`; `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][1]`; `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`; `min_wait_time` is updated to equal `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is set to 2.**
