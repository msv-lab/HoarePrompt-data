Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer within the range 1 to 100; `t` is an integer within the range 1 to 100000; `buses` is a list containing `n` tuples of the form (s, d); `min_time` is positive infinity; `ans` is -1; `i` is 0; `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`; `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`; `time` is `(t - s) % d`; the current value of `time` is less than `min_time`.***
