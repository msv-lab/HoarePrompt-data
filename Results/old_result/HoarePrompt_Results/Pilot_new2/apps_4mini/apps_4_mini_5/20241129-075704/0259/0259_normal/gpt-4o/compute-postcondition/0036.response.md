Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2; `i` is 2; `s_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][0]`; `d_i` is equal to `bus_routes[2][1]`. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to equal `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to 3. Otherwise, if `wait_time` is not less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` remains unchanged, and `chosen_route` remains as previously set.***
