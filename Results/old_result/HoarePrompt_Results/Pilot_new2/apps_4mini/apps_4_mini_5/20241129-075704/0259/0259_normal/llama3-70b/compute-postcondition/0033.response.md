The function `func` accepts two positive integers `n` and `t`, where `n` represents the number of bus routes and `t` represents a specific time. It then collects `n` tuples of positive integers `(s_i, d_i)` representing the starting time and duration of each bus route. After processing the bus routes, the function calculates the minimum wait time for a bus based on the current time `t` and the schedule of each bus, and identifies which bus (1-based index) results in the minimum wait time. Finally, it prints the index of this bus. 

However, if `n` is 0 (though not explicitly handled in the input constraints), the function would not execute the loop for bus routes, leaving the result as -1, indicating no valid bus route. The functionality of the function does not account for cases where there are no bus routes given, but based on the constraints, `n` is expected to be at least 1.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers `n` (number of bus routes) and `t` (current time), collects `n` tuples of bus route parameters `(s_i, d_i)`, calculates the minimum wait time for the buses, and prints the 1-based index of the bus that results in the minimum wait time. If there are no bus routes, it would print -1. **
