Correctness: **True**

The given program correctly converts an integer score (within the range 0 to 99) into its English word representation, as specified in the problem description. Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input Range:** The program explicitly restricts the input to integers between 0 and 99, which is in line with the problem requirements.

2. **Handling of Different Ranges:**
   - For numbers from 0 to 9, the program correctly maps each digit to its respective word using the `ones` list.
   - For numbers from 10 to 19, it utilizes the `teens` list to provide the correct English words.
   - For numbers from 20 to 99, it calculates the tens and units correctly. It uses the `tens` list for the tens place and appends the word for the units place if itâ€™s non-zero, ensuring proper formatting with a hyphen when necessary.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - At the lower end, the input 0 is handled correctly as `''` (the word for zero is not required).
   - At the upper end, the input 99 is correctly output as `ninety-nine`.

Given the comprehensive coverage of all cases specified in the problem description and the correct formatting without any missed edge cases, the program behaves as intended.

Thus, the program is correct and meets all specified requirements.
