Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all possible inputs according to the problem description. Specifically, the function `func_1` fails to account for the case when `n` is 10. 

In the `tens` list, there is an entry for 'ten' at index 1, but the conditional structure does not explicitly return 'ten' when `n` equals 10. Since there is no explicit condition to handle this case, the program would fall through to the `else` where it checks if `10 <= n <= 99`, which would lead to the wrong output for `n = 10`. 

Thus, when `s` is 10, the function would not return "ten" as required, breaking the correctness of the program as per the problem description. All numbers from 0 to 99 need correct string representations, and since 10 is not handled correctly, the function fails to fulfill the problem requirements.
