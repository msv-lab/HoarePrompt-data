The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99. The function returns different string representations of the integer `n` based on its value:

- Case_1: If `n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 9, the function returns the string representation of `n` using the list `ones`.
- Case_2: If `n` is an integer in the range between 11 and 19, the function returns the string representation of `n` using the `teens` list, specifically at the index `n - 10`.
- Case_3: If `n` is a multiple of 10 and falls within the range of 10 to 99, the function returns the string representation of the tens place for the integer `n`.
- Case_4: For other cases, the function returns the string representation of `n` in the format of 'tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]', combining the string representations from the lists `tens` and `ones`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the range of 0 to 99 and return its string representation in various formats based on the specified conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, and returns its string representation based on its value: as defined in `ones` for 0 <= n <= 9, from `teens` for 11 <= n <= 19, the tens representation for multiples of 10 from 10 to 99, or as a combination of `tens` and `ones` for other values.**
