The code snippet takes an integer `s`, which is guaranteed to be between 20 and 99, and converts it to a string representation in English. It uses `tens` to find the tens place and `ones` for the ones place. The tens digit is found by integer division of `s` by 10, and the ones digit is obtained by the modulus operation with 10.

Since `s` is guaranteed to be 20 or greater, there is no need to check for the 'teens' case. The code constructs a string from the `tens` list (for the tens place) and the `ones` list (for the ones place) and prints it.

The output of the print statement is a string that represents the number `s` in words, formatted according to whether it has a ones component or not.

Output State: **`s` is an input integer such that 10 ≤ `s` ≤ 99; `ones` is ['', 'one', 'two', 'three', 'four', 'five', 'six', 'seven', 'eight', 'nine']; `teens` is ['ten', 'eleven', 'twelve', 'thirteen', 'fourteen', 'fifteen', 'sixteen', 'seventeen', 'eighteen', 'nineteen']; `tens` is ['', '', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety']; and the output is `tens[s // 10] + ('' if s % 10 == 0 else '-' + ones[s % 10])`.**
