The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraint that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). The output of the function depends on the value of `n`, but the specific output is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, we can only summarize that the function deals with `n` under these constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on a non-negative integer n, where 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. The specific output based on n is not provided.**
