The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial condition states that `n` is a non-negative integer such that \( 0 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). After running the code, `n` will now hold the value that was inputted by the user, and this value will still satisfy the original condition of being a non-negative integer within the specified range.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, updated to the value of `int(input())`.**
