Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the rounding logic as described in the problem statement. Here’s why the program meets the requirements:

1. **Input Validity**: The program accepts a non-negative integer `n` that falls within the specified range (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9). This is validated by the problem description.

2. **Rounding Logic**:
   - The program computes the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 using `n % 10`. This remainder determines how close `n` is to the nearest multiples of 10.
   - If the remainder is less than or equal to 5 (`remainder <= 5`), it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 by subtracting the remainder from `n` (`result = n - remainder`).
   - If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10 by adding the difference to reach the next multiple of 10 (`result = n + (10 - remainder)`).

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` already ends in 0, the program correctly identifies that `result` should be `n`.
   - For other values, it correctly chooses between rounding down or up based on the value of the remainder, adhering to the rounding rules.

4. **Output**: The result is printed as specified in the output requirements.

The program correctly implements the rounding logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases, thus it meets the correctness criteria.
