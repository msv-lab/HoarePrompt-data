Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` from user input and prints the nearest multiple of 10 to `n`. If `n` is already a multiple of 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and the last digit is 5 or less, it prints the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`. If the last digit is greater than 5, it prints the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`. However, the function does not return any value; it only prints the result. **
