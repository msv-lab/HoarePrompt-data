To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze it against the problem description.

**Problem description:** 
Vasya wants to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` already ends with 0, it is considered rounded. The output should be a valid answer according to the rounding rules.

**Program:**
```python
n = int(input())
remainder = n % 10
if remainder <= 5:
    result = n - remainder
else:
    result = n + (10 - remainder)
print(result)
```

**Analysis of the Program:**

1. **Input Handling:** The program correctly reads an integer input.

2. **Rounding Logic:**
   - The program calculates the remainder when `n` is divided by 10 (using `n % 10`).
   - If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from `n` (this will yield `n - remainder`).
   - If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding `(10 - remainder)` to `n`.

3. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is already a multiple of 10 (e.g., `n = 100`, `n = 0`), the remainder will be 0, and the program will return `n`, which is correct.
   - For `n = 5`, the remainder is 5, and the program will round down to `0`, which is one of the valid outputs. It could also return `10`, but returning `0` is acceptable.
   - For `n = 11`, the remainder is 1, and it correctly returns `10`.
   - For `n = 15`, the remainder is 5, and it correctly returns `10`.
   - For `n = 14`, the remainder is 4, and it correctly returns `10`.
   - For `n = 16`, the remainder is 6, and it correctly rounds up to return `20`.

4. **Valid Outputs:** The program adheres to the requirement that outputs can be non-unique as long as they are valid rounded numbers.

Based on the analysis, the program works correctly for all tested cases and adheres to the rounding rules as specified in the problem description. 

**Conclusion:**
Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly rounds `n` to the nearest integer ending in 0, handling all described cases accurately.
