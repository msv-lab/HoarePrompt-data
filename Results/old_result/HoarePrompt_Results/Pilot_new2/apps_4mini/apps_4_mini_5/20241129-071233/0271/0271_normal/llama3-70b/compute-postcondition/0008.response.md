Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9 and is not a multiple of 10. If the remainder of `n` when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, the function returns the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`, which is `n - n % 10`. Otherwise, if the remainder is greater than 5, the function returns `n + (10 - n % 10)`, which rounds `n` up to the next multiple of 10.***
