Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `colors` is a list of n integers ranging from 1 to m; `k` is a list of m integers with 1 ≤ sum(k) ≤ n; `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping from integers 1 to m to the corresponding values in k; `current_counts` satisfies `current_counts[colors[0]]` ≥ `desired_counts[colors[0]]`; and `left` is increased by 1. If the counts in `current_counts` match the `desired_counts` for all colors in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'.***
