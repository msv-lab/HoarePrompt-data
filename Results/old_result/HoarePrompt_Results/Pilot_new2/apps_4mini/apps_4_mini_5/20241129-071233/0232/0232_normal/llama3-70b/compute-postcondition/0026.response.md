The code snippet increments the count of the selected `color` in the `window_counts` dictionary by 1. The initial conditions dictate that if `color` is not found in `window_counts`, its starting value is 0. Therefore, after executing the line, `window_counts[color]` will be updated to 1.

The values of other variables remain unchanged. Consequently, the output state captures the updated count for the specified `color`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each unique color from `colors` is a key and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that color in the `colors` list, `found` is `False`, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `color` is `colors[0]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1.**
