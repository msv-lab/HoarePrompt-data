Output State: **`left` is equal to the number of elements processed from the `colors` list plus the number of elements in `colors` that satisfy the desired counts, and it is not the case that `current_counts[color]` is equal to `desired_counts[color]` for all colors in `desired_counts`, meaning there exists at least one color in `desired_counts` such that `current_counts[color]` is not equal to `desired_counts[color]`; `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by 1.**
