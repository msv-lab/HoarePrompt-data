The `counts` variable is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input values split into a list of strings. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not directly affected, but the `colors` variable will now be reflected in the `counts` list. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers based on input values, `counts` is a list of integers converted from input values.**
