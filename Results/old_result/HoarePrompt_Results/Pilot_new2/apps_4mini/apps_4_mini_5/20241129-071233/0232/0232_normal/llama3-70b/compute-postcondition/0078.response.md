Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors; `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping each unique color from `colors` to its count of occurrences; `found` is `True`; `i` is less than `n`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `window_counts[color]` is equal to its previous value plus 1. If the counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target values, the program will break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
