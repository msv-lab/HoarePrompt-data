The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, a list of `n` integers representing the colors of lightsabers, and a list of `m` integers representing the target counts of those colors. It checks if there exists a contiguous subarray of the `colors` list such that the counts of each color in that subarray match exactly the counts specified in the `counts` list. If such a subarray is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. Edge cases include ensuring that the `counts` list does not exceed the available colors and that the counts match exactly.
