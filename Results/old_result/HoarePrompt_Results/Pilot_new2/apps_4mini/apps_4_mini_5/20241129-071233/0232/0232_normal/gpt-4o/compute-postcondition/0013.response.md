Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; `k` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ sum(k) ≤ n; `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping from each integer in the range 1 to m to the corresponding values in `k`; and `current_counts` has one entry for `colors[0]` decreased by 1. If all entries of `current_counts` match the corresponding entries in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES', indicating that it is possible to adjust the entries of `current_counts` to match `desired_counts`; otherwise, the program does not return any value.***
