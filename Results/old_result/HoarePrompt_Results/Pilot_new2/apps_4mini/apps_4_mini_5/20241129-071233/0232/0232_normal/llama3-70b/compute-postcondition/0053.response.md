According to the code provided, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will execute if the starting value of `j` (which is `i`) is less than `n`. Given that `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is equal to `n` initially, for the loop to execute, `i` must be less than `n`. 

Thus, we need to ensure that:
1. `i` is less than `n` (which implies that `i` must be at least 1 if `n` is at least 2).
2. The initial value of `j` when the loop starts should be equal to `i`.

Given that `i` is already incremented by 1, it implies that `i` should not equal `n` after the increment for the loop to start executing.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping each unique color from `colors` to its count of occurrences, `found` is `True`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `window_counts` is {}`.
