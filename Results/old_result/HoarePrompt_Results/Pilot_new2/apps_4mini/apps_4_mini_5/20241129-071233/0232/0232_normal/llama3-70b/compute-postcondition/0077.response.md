The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`; `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors; `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping each unique color from `colors` to its count of occurrences; `found` is `True`; `i` is less than `n`; `j` is equal to `i + 2`; `window_counts[color]` is equal to its previous value plus 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
