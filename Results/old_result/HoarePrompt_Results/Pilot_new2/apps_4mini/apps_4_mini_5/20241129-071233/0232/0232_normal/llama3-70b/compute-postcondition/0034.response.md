Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each unique color from `colors` is a key and the corresponding value is the count of occurrences of that color in the `colors` list, `found` is `True`, `i` is 0, `j` is 1, `color` is `colors[1]`, and if `color` is not present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0.***
