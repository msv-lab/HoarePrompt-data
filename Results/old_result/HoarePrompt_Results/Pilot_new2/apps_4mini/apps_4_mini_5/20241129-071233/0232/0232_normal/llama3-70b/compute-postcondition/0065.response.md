The code snippet `window_counts[color] = 0` assigns the value `0` to the key `color` in the dictionary `window_counts`. The variable `color` is assigned the value `colors[j]`, where `j` is equal to `i + 1`. Since `i` is less than `n`, `j` is guaranteed to be a valid index in the `colors` list. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State reflects the change made to `window_counts`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping each unique color from `colors` to its count of occurrences, `found` is `True`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `color` is assigned the value `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is 0.**
