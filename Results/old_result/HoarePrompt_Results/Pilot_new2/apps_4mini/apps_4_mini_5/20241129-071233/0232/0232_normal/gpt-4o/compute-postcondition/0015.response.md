The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, so the output state reflects the updated value of `left`. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100; `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; `k` is a list of m integers where 1 ≤ sum(k) ≤ n; `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping from each integer in the range 1 to m to the corresponding values in k; `current_counts` is updated such that the entry for `colors[0]` is decreased by 1; `left` is increased by 1.**
