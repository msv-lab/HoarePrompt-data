The variable `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The values of `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `counts` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code snippet. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `colors` is a list of integers based on input values, `counts` is a list of integers converted from input values, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary.**
