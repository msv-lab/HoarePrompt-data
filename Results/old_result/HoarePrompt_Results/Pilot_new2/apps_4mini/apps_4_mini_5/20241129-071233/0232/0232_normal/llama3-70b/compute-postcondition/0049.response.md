The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing `n` colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each unique color from `colors` is a key with the corresponding count of occurrences in the `colors` list, `found` is `True`, `i` is the original value of `i`, `j` is equal to `n`, `window_counts` contains the counts of the colors found in the current window, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
