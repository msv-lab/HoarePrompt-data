The value of `is_spalindrome` is assigned `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 2, and `is_spalindrome` is `False`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` must be greater than or equal to 5, `i` is 2, and `is_spalindrome` is `False`.**
