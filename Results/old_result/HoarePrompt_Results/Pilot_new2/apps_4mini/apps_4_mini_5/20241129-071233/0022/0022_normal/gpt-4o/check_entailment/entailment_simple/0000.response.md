The provided program is intended to check if the given string `s` is an "s-palindrome" based on the problem description. However, it only checks if the string is a standard palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), which is not sufficient to determine if it is an "s-palindrome" as defined in the problem.

According to the problem description, a string is considered an "s-palindrome" if it is symmetric about the middle, which means that for odd-length strings, the middle character should be ignored, and for even-length strings, the two halves should be mirror images of each other. 

The provided function `func_1(s)` only checks if the characters at symmetric positions from the start and end of the string are the same, which is the definition of a typical palindrome, not an "s-palindrome." 

For example, the string "oHo" would be considered an "s-palindrome," and the function would return `True`, which is correct. However, the string "aa" would also return `True`, while it should return `False` according to the problem description because the second half is not a mirror reflection of the first half.

Thus, there are cases where the function does not follow the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **False**
