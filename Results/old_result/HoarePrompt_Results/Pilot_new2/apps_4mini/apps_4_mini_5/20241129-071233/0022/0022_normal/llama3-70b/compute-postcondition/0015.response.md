Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 5, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to `False` and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
