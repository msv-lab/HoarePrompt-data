Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. Here's why:

1. The condition `if (max_upvotes < min_downvotes)` checks if the maximum possible upvotes (which is `x + z`) is less than the minimum downvotes (`y`). If this condition is true, it correctly prints `'-'`, indicating that there are definitely more downvotes than upvotes.

2. The second condition `if (max_downvotes < min_upvotes)` checks if the maximum possible downvotes (`y + z`) is less than the minimum upvotes (`x`). If this condition is true, it prints `'+'`, indicating that there are definitely more upvotes than downvotes.

3. However, the issue arises in the case where neither of the above conditions are true. The program prints `'?'` in that case. This means that it concludes uncertainty even when there might be a definite result. For example, if `x`, `y`, and `z` are all equal (e.g., `1, 1, 1`), the program will incorrectly conclude uncertainty (`'?'`) when in fact there is a definite result (`'0'`).

Specifically, the cases where the outputs should be `'0'` (when `x == y` and `z == 0`) are not handled correctly, since the program only checks for maximums and minimums without explicitly addressing the case when upvotes and downvotes are equal, leading to potentially incorrect interpretations of the voting situation.

Thus, the program fails to account for the cases where the number of upvotes equals the number of downvotes when there are no unknown votes. Therefore, it does not always align with the specified behavior in the problem description.
