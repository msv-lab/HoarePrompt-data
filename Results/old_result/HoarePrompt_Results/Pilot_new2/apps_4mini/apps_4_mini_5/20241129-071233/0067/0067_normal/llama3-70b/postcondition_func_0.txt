The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` through input, which must be in the range of 0 to 100. It prints '+' if `x` is greater than `y + z`. If `x` is less than `y`, it does not output anything. If `x` is equal to `y`, it prints '0' if `z` is 0, or '?' if `z` is greater than 0. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y` and not equal to `y`, it simply prints '?'. There is no return value from the function.
