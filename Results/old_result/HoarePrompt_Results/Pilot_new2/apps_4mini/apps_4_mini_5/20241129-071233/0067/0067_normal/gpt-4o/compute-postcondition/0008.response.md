Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are integers in the range [0, 100]; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`; the current value of `max_downvotes` is less than the current value of `min_upvotes`.***
