Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, the condition `if (x < y)` is problematic because it does not provide an output in that scenario. The problem statement requires that if there are more downvotes than upvotes, the result should be "-", but the program has no output for when `x < y`. Thus, this case results in no output, which is not compliant with the requirement to print a definite result for all scenarios.

Additionally, the program incorrectly uses the output "?" for cases that have definitive results based on the values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. For example:
1. If `x` is equal to `y` but `z` is greater than 0, the program outputs "?", which is correct.
2. If `x` is less than `y`, the program does not provide any output, which is incorrect since it should print "-" when `y` is greater than `x` and there are no unknown votes.

These issues demonstrate that the program fails to meet the requirements set forth in the problem description for all potential cases.
