Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. If `x` is equal to `y`, if `z` is 0, then `x` and `y` remain unchanged, otherwise, a string '?' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `y`, a string '?' is printed.***
