Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100 and `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`. If `x` is less than `y`, the function proceeds without a specific return value. If `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is 0, `x` and `y` remain unchanged; otherwise, a string '?' is printed. If `x` is not equal to `y`, a string '?' is printed.***
