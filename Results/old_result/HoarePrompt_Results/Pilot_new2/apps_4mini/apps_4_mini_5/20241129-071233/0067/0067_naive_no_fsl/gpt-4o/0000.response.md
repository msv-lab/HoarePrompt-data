Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to account for certain situations, specifically when the result is exactly equal between upvotes and downvotes due to the unknown votes. 

For instance, consider the input `(0, 0, 1)`. There is one unknown voter, which could either upvote or downvote. In this case, the possible outcomes are:
- If the unknown person upvotes, the total is +1 (more upvotes than downvotes).
- If the unknown person downvotes, the total is -1 (more downvotes than upvotes).

Thus, the result is uncertain and should print `?`. However, the program checks for conditions that would imply a certain outcome, and it would incorrectly classify this input. 

Additionally, inputs like `(1, 1, 1)` would also lead to an uncertain result, as the possibilities would be:
- Upvote: 2 vs 1 (resulting in `+`)
- Downvote: 1 vs 2 (resulting in `-`)
- Balanced: 1 vs 1 (resulting in `0`)

All of these indicate uncertainty, but the program does not handle this correctly.

In summary, the program does not correctly identify all uncertain scenarios as per the problem description, leading to its incorrectness.
