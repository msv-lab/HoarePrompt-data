According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The loop will continue executing as long as there are more permutations to process. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation must be obtained.

Since `perm` represents the current permutation and the loop will generate all permutations of `chars`, after the current `perm`, there will be another permutation to take into account.

State: **`chars` is a string containing digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining the characters in `perm`.**
