`candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates all the characters in the permutation `perm` into a single string. The variable `chars` remains a string containing digits, and `perm` represents the first permutation of `chars`. The output state reflects the new value of `candidate` while preserving the previous states of `chars` and `perm`. 

Output State: **`chars` is a string containing digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining the characters in `perm`.**
