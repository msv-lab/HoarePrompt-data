The code `n += c` means that the current value of `n` will be concatenated with `c`. The variable `n` is initially an empty string. The variable `c` is an element of `t_set`, which means it is one of the unique characters present in the substring `t`.

Since `n` starts as an empty string, after executing `n += c`, the value of `n` will be equal to the string `c`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters from `t`, `n` is equal to `c`, and the current value of `c` is an element of `t_set`.**
