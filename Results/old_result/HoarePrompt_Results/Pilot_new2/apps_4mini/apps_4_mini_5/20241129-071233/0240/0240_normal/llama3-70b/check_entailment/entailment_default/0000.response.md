To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's first analyze the code and its functionality.

### Code Analysis
```python
s = input()
t = input()

def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
    n += t
    return int(n)

print(func_1(s, t))
```

1. **Input Handling**: 
   - The program reads two input strings: `s` (the shuffled digits) and `t` (the remembered substring of `n`).

2. **Function `func_1`**:
   - It creates a set `t_set` containing the characters of `t` for quick lookup.
   - It initializes an empty string `n` to accumulate characters from `s`.
   - It iterates through each character `c` in `s`, and if `c` is in `t_set`, it appends `c` to `n`.
   - Finally, it appends `t` to `n` and returns the integer conversion of `n`.

### Problem Description Compliance
The goal is to find the smallest possible integer `n` that could result from the transformation described. The logic of the code may not satisfy the requirement to construct the smallest integer `n` based on the digits present in `s` and the substring `t`. The following points lead to this conclusion:

- **Leading Zeros**: The program does not handle leading zeros in `n` correctly. If `s` has a character '0' and `t` is not '0', it might result in an invalid formation of `n`, especially if '0' should not be at the start of the integer.
  
- **Character Extraction**: The approach to forming `n` by concatenating characters from `s` (only those that are in `t`) before adding `t` does not guarantee the smallest possible integer. For example, if `s = "003512"` and `t = "021"`, the output would be `30021`, which is not the smallest possible integer since the '0's can be placed after the first non-zero digit.

### Output Hints Assessment
The output hints state that the function constructs `n` from `s` by extracting characters that are found in `t`, which aligns with the code. However, the hints do not address the potential issues with leading zeros and the ordering of `n` with respect to its minimality, which is crucial given the problem's requirements. 

### Conclusion
Despite the function performing its operations, it does not correctly adhere to the problem description's requirement of forming the smallest possible integer `n`. The code fails to consider all possible arrangements and placements of digits to ensure the minimal value, especially with respect to leading zeros.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the problem requirements as expected in every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

An example where the program fails is:
- Input:
  ```
  003512
  021
  ```
  Output should be `30021`, but `n` could also be formed as `20301`, which is smaller.
