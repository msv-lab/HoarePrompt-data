Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string containing digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining the characters in `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number when checked against `sub` using the `is_valid_number` function, then `candidate` has been yielded as a valid number.***
