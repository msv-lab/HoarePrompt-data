The value of `n` is incremented by the value of `c`, which is the next character in `s` that must be processed. Given that `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `c` will be a digit as well. The value of `n` will be updated as `n + c`, where `c` is interpreted as its integer value. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters from `t`, `c` is the next character in `s` that must be processed, `n` is updated to `n + int(c)`**.
