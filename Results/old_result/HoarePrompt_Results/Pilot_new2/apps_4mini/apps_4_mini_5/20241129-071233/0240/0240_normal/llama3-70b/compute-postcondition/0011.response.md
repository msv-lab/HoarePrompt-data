Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters from `t`, and `c` is the next character in `s` that must be processed. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is updated to `n + int(c)`. There is no else part in the code.***
