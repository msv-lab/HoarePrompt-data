The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer constrained such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^9 \). The parameter `k` is a non-negative integer constrained such that \( 0 \leq k \leq 8 \). After executing the function body, the output based on the parameters is not explicitly provided, but the function is expected to handle these parameters according to their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n (a positive integer between 1 and 10^9) and k (a non-negative integer between 0 and 8), and performs operations based on these inputs.**
