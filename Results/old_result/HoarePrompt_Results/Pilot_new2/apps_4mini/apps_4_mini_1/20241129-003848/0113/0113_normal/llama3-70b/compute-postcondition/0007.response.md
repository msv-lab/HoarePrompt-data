`n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer not equal to 10, the new value of `n` will still be a positive integer and will not be equal to 10. The condition that `n` must not be divisible by `x` remains valid as `n` is simply increased by 1. Therefore, the states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer not equal to 10 and `n` is now incremented by 1, still not divisible by `x`.**
