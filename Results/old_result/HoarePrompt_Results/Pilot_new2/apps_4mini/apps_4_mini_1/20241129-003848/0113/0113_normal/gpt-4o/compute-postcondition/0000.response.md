The value of `multiplier` is assigned the value of `10 ** k`, where `k` is a non-negative integer such that `0 ≤ k ≤ 8`. This means that `multiplier` can take on values ranging from \(10^0 = 1\) (when \(k = 0\)) to \(10^8 = 100000000\) (when \(k = 8\)). The states of the other variables, namely `n` and `k`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9\), `k` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 ≤ k ≤ 8\), and `multiplier` is either \(1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000,\) or \(100000000\) depending on the value of \(k\).

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000 depending on the value of `k`.**
