The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the parameter `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, it returns `x`, which is equal to `n` multiplied by (multiplier divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and multiplier). Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return a value `x` that is calculated based on the given parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and returns `x`, which is equal to `n` multiplied by (multiplier divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and multiplier).**
