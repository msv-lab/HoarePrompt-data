The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in the provided definition. However, based on the constraints given, it is implied that the function operates on the parameters `n` and `a`. 

- `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \).
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, where each integer is in the range from 1 to `n`.

The functionality of the function is not specified in the provided output section. Therefore, we cannot derive specific output conditions or return values without additional information.

Assuming a hypothetical scenario where the function returns a summary based on the characteristics of `a`, we might state:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n distinct integers (each integer between 1 and n). The specific return value or behavior is not defined in the provided context.** 

If there were specific output conditions given for the function, we could further elaborate on the return value based on those conditions.
