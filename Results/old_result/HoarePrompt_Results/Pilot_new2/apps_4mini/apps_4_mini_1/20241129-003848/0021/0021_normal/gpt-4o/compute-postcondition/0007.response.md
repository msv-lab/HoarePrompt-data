The variable `dist4` is assigned the value of `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`. The values of `n` and `min_pos` remain unchanged from their initial state. The other variables `dist1`, `dist2`, and `dist3` retain their previous values as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`; `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers obtained from input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is equal to `abs(max_pos)`; `dist2` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`; `dist3` is equal to `abs(0 - min_pos)`; `dist4` is equal to `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`.**
