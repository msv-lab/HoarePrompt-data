Functionality: ** The function reads an integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers representing a permutation of size `n` (each integer is between 1 and `n` inclusive). It then calculates the maximum distance of the positions of the integers `1` and `n` from both ends of the list (the first position and the last position), and prints the maximum of these distances. **
