The value of `n` is assigned the value from `int(input())`, which means it now holds an integer input from the user. The initial condition states that `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, so after execution, `n` will still remain within that range. The other variable `a` is unaffected by this line of code. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive**.
