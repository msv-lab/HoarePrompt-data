Postcondition: ***`K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9; `A` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `gcd` is greater than or equal to `(N + 1) * (N + 1)`; `i` is equal to `N + 1`. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, and if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // (N + 1)`.***
