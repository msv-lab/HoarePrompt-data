According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `N`, which is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, to execute again, `i` must be `N + 1`, and we need to ensure that `N + 1` is still less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`.

Since `N` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`, and we want to check the condition for the next iteration, we can state that `gcd` must be greater than or equal to `(N + 1) * (N + 1)` to ensure that it continues to satisfy the loop condition.

State: **`K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9; `A` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements; `gcd` is greater than or equal to `(N + 1) * (N + 1)`; `i` is equal to `N + 1`**
