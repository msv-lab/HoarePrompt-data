The value of `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`, which is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`, `i` is `N-1`, and `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`.

Output State: **`K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1], ..., A[N-1])`, `i` is `N-1`, and `max_divisor` is equal to `gcd`.**
