Output State: **`x` is a tuple where the first element is a positive integer `N` (2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer `K` (0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list of `N` positive integers `A` (1 <= A_i <= 10^6). `divisors` is a set that contains all divisors of `x` up to `sqrt(x)`, including both `i` and `x // i` for each valid `i`.**
