The variable `A` is assigned a list of integers that are inputted as a space-separated string and converted to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `N` and `K` remain unchanged, as the input does not affect them directly. The output state will reflect that `A` now contains a list of integers based on user input, while `N` and `K` retain their original conditions.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9; `A` is a list of integers based on user input.**
