The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a tuple. The first element of the tuple is a positive integer `N` (where 2 <= N <= 500), the second element is a non-negative integer `K` (where 0 <= K <= 10^9), and the third element is a list `A` containing `N` positive integers (where each element A_i satisfies 1 <= A_i <= 10^6). 

After executing the function body, it returns a sorted list of all divisors of the first element `N` in reverse order. The divisors are calculated up to the square root of `N`, and both `i` and `N // i` are included for each valid `i`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple x, where the first element is a positive integer N, the second is a non-negative integer K, and the third is a list of N positive integers. It returns a sorted list of all divisors of N in reverse order.**
