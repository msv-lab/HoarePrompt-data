The variable `gcd` is updated to be the greatest common divisor of the current value of `gcd` and the element `A[i]`, where `i` is currently 2. Since `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1])`, the new value of `gcd` will now be the greatest common divisor of `math.gcd(A[0], A[1])` and `A[2]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 3, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(math.gcd(A[0], A[1]), A[2])`, `i` is 2**
