The values of `N` and `K` are assigned the result of the `map` function which processes the input and converts it into integers. The initial state specifies that `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, and `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9. The values of `N` and `K` will now reflect the user input.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, assigned the values from user input.**
