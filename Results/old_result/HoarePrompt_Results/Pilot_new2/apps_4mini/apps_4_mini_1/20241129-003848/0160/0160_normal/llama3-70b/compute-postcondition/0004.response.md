The variable `gcd` is updated to be the greatest common divisor of its current value and the value at index `i` of list `A`. The initial value of `gcd` is `A[0]`, and the index `i` is 1, so `gcd` will now be equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1])`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`N` must be at least 2, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `gcd` is equal to `math.gcd(A[0], A[1])`, `i` is 1**
