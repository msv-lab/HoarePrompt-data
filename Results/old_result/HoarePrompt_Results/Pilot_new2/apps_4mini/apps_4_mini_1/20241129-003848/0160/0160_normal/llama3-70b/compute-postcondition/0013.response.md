`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `i`. Since `i` is `N-1`, and given that `max_divisor` is initially equal to `gcd`, the new value of `max_divisor` will be the larger of `gcd` or `N-1`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `gcd` is greater than 0, `i` is N-1, `max_divisor` is the maximum between `gcd` and `N-1`.**
