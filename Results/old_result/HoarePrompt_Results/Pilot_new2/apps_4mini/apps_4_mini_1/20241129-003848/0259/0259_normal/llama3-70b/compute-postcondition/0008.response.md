According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `_` and `n`. The loop iterates `n` times, and since `_` is currently equal to `n`, it indicates that the last iteration has completed. 

At the end of the last iteration, `_` is equal to `n`, which means that the loop has completed all its iterations. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `_` to `n` (which will be incremented to `n + 1`, but since the loop is based on the range of `n`, we can consider that a new iteration cannot start once we reach the value of `n`).

Thus, if we want to consider the next potential state, the state of `_` would need to be `n + 1` for clarity, but the loop will not actually execute again since it is already at `n`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `_` is equal to `n + 1`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `buses` now contains a tuple `(s, d)` appended to it.**
