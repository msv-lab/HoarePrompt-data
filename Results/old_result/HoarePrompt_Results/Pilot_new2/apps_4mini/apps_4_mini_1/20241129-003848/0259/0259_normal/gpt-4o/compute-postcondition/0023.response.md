Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers; if `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`, and `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. Otherwise, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[i]`, and if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, while `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged; if not, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Additionally, `i` is incremented by 1 in both cases.***
