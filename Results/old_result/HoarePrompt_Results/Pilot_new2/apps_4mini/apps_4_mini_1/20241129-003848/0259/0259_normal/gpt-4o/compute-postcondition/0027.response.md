According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the upper limit `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the current index in the range of `n`. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 after each iteration, for it to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 100 \), and at the end of the last iteration, `i` must have been less than \( n \). Thus, if we assume `i` was the last value before the loop ended, we need to increment `i` by 1 for the next iteration.

Therefore, if `i` was the last valid value in the range, it would now be `i + 1`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `i + 1` must be less than `n`, meaning `n` must be greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers, `i` is the next index which is less than `n`, and `chosen_route` remains unchanged.**
