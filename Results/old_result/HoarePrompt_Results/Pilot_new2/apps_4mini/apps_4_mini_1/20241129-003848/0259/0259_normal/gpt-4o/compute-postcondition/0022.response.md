Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers; `i` is incremented to `i + 1`; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[i]`; if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0, while `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged; otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
