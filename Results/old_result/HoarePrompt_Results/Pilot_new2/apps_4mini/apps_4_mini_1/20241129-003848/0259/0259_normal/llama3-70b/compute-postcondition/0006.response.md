The values of `s` and `d` are assigned new values based on user input. The previous values of `s` and `d` are replaced by the integers provided through input. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `_` is equal to `n`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `buses` now contains a tuple `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are the input integers.**
