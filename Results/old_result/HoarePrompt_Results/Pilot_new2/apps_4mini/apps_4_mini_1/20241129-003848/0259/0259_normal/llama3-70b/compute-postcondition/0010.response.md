The `buses` variable is a list that now contains a tuple `(s, d)` appended to it. The values of `s` and `d` are input integers, but their specific values are not known from the given initial state. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`; `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`; `_` is equal to `n + 1`; `s` is an input integer; `d` is an input integer; `buses` now contains a tuple `(s, d)` appended to it.**
