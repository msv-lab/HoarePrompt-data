The variable `ans` is assigned the value `-1`. This does not affect any other variables in the state. The initial conditions regarding `n`, `t`, `buses`, and `min_time` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `buses` now contains `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, `min_time` is `float('inf')`, and `ans` is `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `buses` now contains `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, `min_time` is `float('inf')`, `ans` is `-1`.**
