Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5; if `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is `s_i - t`. Otherwise, if `s_i` is less than `t`, if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i.***
