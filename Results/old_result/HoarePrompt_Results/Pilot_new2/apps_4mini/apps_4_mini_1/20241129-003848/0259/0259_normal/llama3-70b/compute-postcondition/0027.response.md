The variable `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`. The value of `time` is calculated as `(t - buses[i][0]) % buses[i][1]`, where `i` is 2. The initial values of `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unchanged, but `min_time` is now defined by the calculation involving `time`. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `3 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `buses` contains `n` tuples of the form `(s, d)`, `i` is 2, `ans` is 2, `min_time` is equal to `(t - buses[i][0]) % buses[i][1]`.**
