Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples containing positive integers; `i` is the next index which is less than `n`; if `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1` and `min_wait_time` is updated to be equal to `wait_time`.***
