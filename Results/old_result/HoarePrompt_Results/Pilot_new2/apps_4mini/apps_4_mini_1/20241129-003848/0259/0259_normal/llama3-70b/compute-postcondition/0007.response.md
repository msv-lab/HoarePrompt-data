The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are input integers, which means they will be specific integers provided at runtime. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but the list `buses` will now contain one additional tuple. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 <= n <= 100`, `t` is a positive integer such that `1 <= t <= 100000`, `_` is equal to `n`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `buses` now contains a tuple `(s, d)` appended to it.**
