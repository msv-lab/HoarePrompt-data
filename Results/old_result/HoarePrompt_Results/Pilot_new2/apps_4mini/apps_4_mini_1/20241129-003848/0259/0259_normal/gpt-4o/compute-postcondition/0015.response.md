The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The variable `i` is not defined in the initial state but is expected to be an integer. Since `i + 1` will always produce a positive integer, `chosen_route` will also be a positive integer. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, and we do not know the exact value of `i`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 10^5; `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, and now `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is equal to `i + 1` (where `i` is an integer).**
