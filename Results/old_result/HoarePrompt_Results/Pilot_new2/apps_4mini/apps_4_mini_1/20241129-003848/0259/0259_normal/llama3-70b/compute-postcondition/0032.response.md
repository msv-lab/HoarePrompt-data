The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `t`. The parameter `n` is an integer constrained such that \(1 \leq n \leq 100\). The parameter `t` is a positive integer constrained such that \(1 \leq t \leq 100000\). Additionally, for each bus route indexed by \(i\) (where \(1 \leq i \leq n\)), there are two integers associated: \(s_i\) and \(d_i\), both of which are constrained such that \(1 \leq s_i, d_i \leq 100000\).

The output of the function is not explicitly detailed in the provided information, so we will summarize the accepted parameters and their constraints without specifying the return value.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` (an integer between 1 and 100) and `t` (a positive integer between 1 and 100000). Additionally, for each bus route indexed by `i`, it accepts `s_i` and `d_i` (both integers between 1 and 100000).**
