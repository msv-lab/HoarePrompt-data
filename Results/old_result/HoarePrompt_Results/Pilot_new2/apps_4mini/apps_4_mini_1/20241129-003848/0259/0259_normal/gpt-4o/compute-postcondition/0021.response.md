To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact on the variables based on the initial state.

1. The variable `i` is incremented by 1, meaning `i` will now hold the value of the previous `i + 1`.
2. The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from the `bus_routes[i]` tuple. Let's denote these values as `s_i = s` and `d_i = d` for simplification.
3. The `wait_time` is calculated as `d - (t - s) % d`. This means `wait_time` depends on the values of `d`, `t`, and `s`.

Given that `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `bus_routes` contains tuples of positive integers (s_i, d_i), and the variables `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are unchanged, we can summarize the output state.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers; `i` is the incremented value `i + 1`; `s_i` is the value `s` from `bus_routes[i]`; `d_i` is the value `d` from `bus_routes[i]`; `wait_time` is calculated as `d - (t - s) % d`; `min_wait_time` remains unchanged; `chosen_route` remains unchanged.**
