The code takes two inputs and assigns them to `n` and `m`. The previous state of `n` is that it is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100. The previous state of `m` is that it is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n. After executing the code, the values of `n` and `m` will be updated to the integers provided through the inputs. The other variables in the initial state remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, `n` is assigned the first input integer, `m` is assigned the second input integer.**
