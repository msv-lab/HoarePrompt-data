Postcondition: ***`left` is equal to the original value of `n`, `right` is equal to the original value of `n`, and current_counts must satisfy all current_counts[color] >= desired_counts[color] for all colors in desired_counts. It is not the case that current_counts[color] equals desired_counts[color] for all colors in desired_counts.***
