To determine the conditions under which the for loop will execute, let's analyze the provided initial state and the loop structure.

1. The loop statement is `for j in range(i, n):`. This means the loop will iterate over the range starting from `i` (which is 2) up to, but not including, `n`.
2. Given that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 100` and must be greater than or equal to 2, the smallest value `n` can take is 2.
3. If `n` is exactly 2, the range would be `range(2, 2)`, which is empty, meaning the loop would not execute.
4. Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `n` must be greater than 2. Specifically, `n` must be at least 3 for the range to contain any elements (in this case, the values of `j` would be 2).

Given these conditions, we can summarize the necessary adjustments:

- `n` must be greater than or equal to 3 for the loop to execute.
- `i` is already set to 2, which is valid.
- The initial value of `j` is not defined before the loop, as it will be set in the loop itself.

Hence, our adjusted state for the loop to execute will be:

State: **`n` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 2 (at the start of the first iteration if n ≥ 3)**
