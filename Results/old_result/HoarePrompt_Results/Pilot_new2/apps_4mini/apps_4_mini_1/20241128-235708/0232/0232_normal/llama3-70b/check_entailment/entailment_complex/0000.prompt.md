You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. Master Heidi needs to select the Jedi Knights who will go on peacekeeping missions throughout the galaxy. It is well-known that the success of any peacekeeping mission depends on the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi who will go on that mission. 

Heidi has n Jedi Knights standing in front of her, each one with a lightsaber of one of m possible colors. She knows that for the mission to be the most effective, she needs to select some contiguous interval of knights such that there are exactly k_1 knights with lightsabers of the first color, k_2 knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., k_{m} knights with lightsabers of the m-th color. Help her find out if this is possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The second line contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights. The third line contains m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} (with $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$) – the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m.


-----Output-----

Output YES if an interval with prescribed color counts exists, or output NO if there is none.


-----Example-----
Input
5 2
1 1 2 2 1
1 2

Output
YES
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100, m is an integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n, the second input line is a list of n integers each in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, and the third input line is a list of m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} such that 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n.
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    colors = list(map(int, input().split()))
    counts = list(map(int, input().split()))
    color_counts = {}
    for color in colors:
        if color not in color_counts:
            color_counts[color] = 0
        
        color_counts[color] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each key is a unique color from the `colors` list and each value is the count of occurrences of that color in the `colors` list. If `colors` is empty, `color_counts` remains an empty dictionary.
    found = False
    for i in range(n):
        window_counts = {}
        
        for j in range(i, n):
            color = colors[j]
            if color not in window_counts:
                window_counts[color] = 0
            window_counts[color] += 1
            if all(count == target for count, target in zip(sorted(window_counts.
                values()), counts)):
                found = True
                break
        
        if found:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `found` indicates whether a valid combination was found (True or False); `window_counts` contains the final counts of colors from the last checked range in the `colors` list.
    print('YES' if found else 'NO')
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, along with a list of `n` integers representing colors and a list of `m` integers representing target counts for those colors. It checks if there exists a contiguous subsequence of colors that matches the specified counts of each unique color. If such a subsequence is found, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly handle cases with invalid input ranges or empty lists, assuming inputs adhere to the constraints defined by the problem statement.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
