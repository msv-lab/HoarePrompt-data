Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `color` is `colors[n - 1]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding `counts` values for all pairs (count, target), then `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop.***
