The statement `window_counts[color] += 1` increments the count of the specified `color` in the `window_counts` dictionary. Since it is stated that if `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is 0, this means that the count for `color` will either be increased from 0 to 1 if it was previously not recorded or incremented by 1 if it was already recorded. The other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, and `color`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100 and must be greater than 1; `i` is 0; `j` is 1; `color` is `colors[1]`; `window_counts[color]` is now 1 if it was previously 0 or incremented by 1 if it was already recorded.**
