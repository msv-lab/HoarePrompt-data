Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `color` is `colors[2]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match their respective targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
