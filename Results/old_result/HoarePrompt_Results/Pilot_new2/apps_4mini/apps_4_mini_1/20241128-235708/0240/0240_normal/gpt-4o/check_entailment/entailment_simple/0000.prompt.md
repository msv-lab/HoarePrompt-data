You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Vasya decided to pass a very large integer n to Kate. First, he wrote that number as a string, then he appended to the right integer k — the number of digits in n. 

Magically, all the numbers were shuffled in arbitrary order while this note was passed to Kate. The only thing that Vasya remembers, is a non-empty substring of n (a substring of n is a sequence of consecutive digits of the number n).

Vasya knows that there may be more than one way to restore the number n. Your task is to find the smallest possible initial integer n. Note that decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except the case the integer n was equal to zero itself (in this case a single digit 0 was used).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the string received by Kate. The number of digits in this string does not exceed 1 000 000.

The second line contains the substring of n which Vasya remembers. This string can contain leading zeroes. 

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct, and the answer always exists.


-----Output-----

Print the smalles integer n which Vasya could pass to Kate.


-----Examples-----
Input
003512
021

Output
30021

Input
199966633300
63

Output
3036366999
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a non-empty string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty substring of s that may contain leading zeroes.
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of `s`, `n_len` is equal to `len(s) - len(sub)`, `s_counter` is updated such that `s_counter` contains the count of each digit in `s` decremented by the count of each digit in `sub`, `sub_counter` remains unchanged.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    return smallest_number
    #The program returns the minimum value from the list 'possible_numbers' based on integer comparison, which is the smallest number that can be formed from the remaining characters after accounting for the substring 'sub' in the string 's'.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_str is a non-empty string consisting of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty string consisting of digits that may contain leading zeroes.
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #The program returns True if 'sub' is found within 'num_str' and the length of 'num_str' is equal to n_len, otherwise it returns False.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: chars is a non-empty string consisting of digits with a length up to 1,000,000, and sub is a non-empty substring made up of digits that may contain leading zeroes.
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of digits, `perm` contains all permutations of `chars`, and `candidate` contains all valid permutations as numbers in relation to `sub`. If no valid permutations exist, no candidates are yielded.


```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
