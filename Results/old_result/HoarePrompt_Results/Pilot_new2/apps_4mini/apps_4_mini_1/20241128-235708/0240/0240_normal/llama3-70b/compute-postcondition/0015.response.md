The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. The parameter `s` is a non-empty string representing a shuffled version of a large integer with a maximum length of 1,000,000 characters. The parameter `t` is a non-empty substring of `s` that may contain leading zeroes. After executing the function body, it returns the integer value of string `n`, which consists of the characters from `s` that are also present in `t` (preserving the order of their appearance in `s`), along with the characters from `t`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a substring `t`, and return an integer formed by concatenating the characters from `s` that are in `t` in order, plus the characters from `t`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `s` (a non-empty string) and `t` (a non-empty substring of `s`), and returns the integer value of a new string formed by characters in `s` that are also in `t`, in order, plus the characters from `t`.**
