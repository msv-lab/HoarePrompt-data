According to the code, the for loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. After the last iteration, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars` that has been processed. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine the next permutation of `chars` that has not yet been yielded as `candidate`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is already the next permutation of `chars`, and the loop iterates over all possible permutations. Therefore, after processing `perm`, the next permutation will be fetched.

The state of `chars` remains unchanged as it is static for the permutations being generated. `sub` and `candidate` should also remain unchanged since they depend on the current permutation being generated.

To prepare for the next iteration, we need to ensure `perm` reflects the next permutation that has not yet been yielded. Since `perm` is already set to the next permutation, it will be updated to the subsequent permutation in the next iteration. 

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty substring of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is equal to `perm`.**
