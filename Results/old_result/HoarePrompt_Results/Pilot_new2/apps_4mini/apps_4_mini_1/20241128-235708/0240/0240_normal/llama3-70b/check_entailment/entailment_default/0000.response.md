To assess the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze both the program code and the problem description, as well as consider the output hints.

### Problem Description:
Vasya sends a string `s` that represents a shuffled large integer and a substring `t` of the original number `n`. The task is to find the smallest integer `n` that could have been formed from `s` and `t`.

### Program Code:
```python
s = input()
t = input()

def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
    n += t
    return int(n)

print(func_1(s, t))
```

### Output Hints:
The function constructs a new integer `n` by including characters from `s` that also appear in `t`, in the order they appear in `s`. It then appends `t` to the end of `n` and returns the integer value.

### Analysis:
1. **Logic of the Program**:
   - The program creates a set from the substring `t` to keep unique characters.
   - It iterates through the string `s` and adds characters to `n` if they are present in `t`.
   - Finally, it appends `t` to `n` and converts it to an integer.

2. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `s` does not contain any characters from `t`, the final result would simply be the integer value of `t`.
   - The program does not ensure the smallest possible value of `n`. It only constructs a valid `n` based on the order of characters in `s` that match `t`. 

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program might not generate the smallest possible integer `n`. For example, if `s` = "3210" and `t` = "01", the resulting integer would be `3041`, while the smallest possible integer could be `1003`. The program does not check if adding characters from `s` could be arranged to form a smaller number.

4. **Output Hints Agreement**:
   - The output hints describe a function that constructs `n` based on the characters found in `s` that are also in `t`. However, they do not clarify that the function may yield a non-minimal value of `n` due to the way characters are appended.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program does not account for creating the smallest integer `n`. It constructs a valid `n` based on available characters but does not ensure that this `n` is the smallest possible. This indicates that the program does not meet the problem's requirements in all cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

### Example of Failure:
If we consider the input `s = "3210"` and `t = "01"`, the output would be `3041`, which is not the smallest possible integer that can be formed (`1003`).
