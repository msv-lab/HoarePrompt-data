The value of `n` is increased by the value of `c`. Given that `c` is the first character of the non-empty string `s`, `c` represents a digit (since it is part of a large integer). Therefore, `n` is incremented by the integer value of `c`. The value of `s` remains unchanged, and `c` still represents the first character of `s`. 

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string representing a shuffled version of a large integer, `c` is the first character in `s`, `c` is an element of `t_set`, and `n` is increased by the integer value of `c`.**
