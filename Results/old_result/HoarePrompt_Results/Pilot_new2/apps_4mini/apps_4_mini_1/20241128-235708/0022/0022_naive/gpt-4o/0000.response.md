Correctness: **False**.

The provided program is intended to check if a string is an "s-palindrome," meaning it is symmetric about its middle. However, the criteria for an "s-palindrome" as described in the problem is not being checked correctly. Specifically, the example of "oHo" being an "s-palindrome" is not being validated properly by the function.

The function checks if characters are equal when mirrored around the center of the string, but it does not take into account the requirement for symmetry mentioned in the problem statement. For instance, the string "oHo" would be incorrectly identified as not s-palindromic because the check only compares the direct mirroring without regard to case sensitivity.

Hereâ€™s a potential case where the program fails:
- Input: "oHo" 
  - Expected output: "TAK"
  - Actual output: "NIE" (because it compares 'o' with 'H', which are not equal)

Thus, the program does not meet the requirements as specified in the problem description.
