`is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The previous value of `is_spalindrome` was `True`, but now it has changed to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged, but we know from the initial state that `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, indicating that the string is not a palindrome.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `n` is greater than or equal to 2; `i` is now 0; `is_spalindrome` is False; the current character `s[i]` is not equal to the character `s[n - i - 1]**.
