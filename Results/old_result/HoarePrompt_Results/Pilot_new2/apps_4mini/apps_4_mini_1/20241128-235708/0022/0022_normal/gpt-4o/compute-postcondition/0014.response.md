Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 characters and checks if it is a palindrome. It returns True if `s` reads the same forwards and backwards, and False if it does not. The function only handles the case of even-length strings adequately since it compares characters until the halfway point, thus it also works correctly for odd-length palindromes. However, the return postconditions do not clarify that False is returned for any non-palindrome comparisons, thus the function can return False in multiple scenarios where the characters do not match. **
