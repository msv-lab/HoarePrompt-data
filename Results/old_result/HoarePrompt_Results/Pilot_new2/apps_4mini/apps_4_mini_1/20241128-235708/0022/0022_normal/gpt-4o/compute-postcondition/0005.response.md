According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop continues to execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. This means `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. Moreover, since `n` is at least 2, `n // 2` will be at least 1, which allows the loop to execute again.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 characters, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and the first character of `s` is equal to the last character of `s`**
