The variable `n` is assigned the value of the length of the string `s`. Since `s` is an input string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, the value of `n` will be an integer between 1 and 1000, inclusive. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive; `n` is the integer value equal to `len(s)` which is between 1 and 1000, inclusive.**
