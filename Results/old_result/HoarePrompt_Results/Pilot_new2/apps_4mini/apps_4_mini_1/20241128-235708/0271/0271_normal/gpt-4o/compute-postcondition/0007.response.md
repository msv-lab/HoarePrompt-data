The `print(result)` statement outputs the value of `result`, which is determined by the value of `n` and `remainder`. The calculation of `result` depends on the conditions involving `remainder`. 

- If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is calculated as `n - remainder`.
- If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is calculated as `n + (10 - remainder)`.

Since we don't have specific values for `n` and `remainder`, we will express `result` in terms of those variables based on the provided conditions.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is a value that determines `result`, which is either `n - remainder` (if `remainder` ≤ 5) or `n + (10 - remainder)` (if `remainder` > 5).**
