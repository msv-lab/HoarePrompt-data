The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is implied that it uses the non-negative integer `n` within its logic, which should be in the range of 0 to 10^9. However, since the parameter is not explicitly defined in the function signature, we cannot refer to it directly. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot conclude its return value or functionality. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and its output is unspecified.**
