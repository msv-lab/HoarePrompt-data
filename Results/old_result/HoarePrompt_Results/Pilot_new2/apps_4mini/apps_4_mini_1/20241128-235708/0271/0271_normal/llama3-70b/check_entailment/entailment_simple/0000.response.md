To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the program against the requirements described.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Given a non-negative integer `n`, the program should round `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0.
2. If `n` is already a multiple of 10, it should return `n`.
3. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, it should return either the largest multiple of 10 less than `n` or the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`. Both options are considered correct.

### Program Logic:
The program performs the following steps:
1. It checks if `n` is a multiple of 10 (`n % 10 == 0`). If true, it prints `n`.
2. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, it further checks if the last digit (i.e., `n % 10`) is less than or equal to 5:
   - If true (`n % 10 <= 5`), it calculates and prints the largest multiple of 10 less than `n` using `n - n % 10`.
   - If false, it calculates and prints the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n` using `n + (10 - n % 10)`.

### Verification:
- **Case 1:** If `n` is 0, the program will print `0`, which is correct.
- **Case 2:** If `n` is a multiple of 10 (e.g., `10`, `20`, `100`), the program will print `n`, which is correct.
- **Case 3:** If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and `n % 10 <= 5` (e.g., `5`, `15`, `25`), the program will correctly round down to the nearest multiple of 10.
- **Case 4:** If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and `n % 10 > 5` (e.g., `6`, `7`, `8`, `9`), the program will correctly round up to the nearest multiple of 10.

Since the program implementation correctly handles all cases as specified in the problem description, it fulfills the requirement of rounding `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0, whether rounding down or up.

### Conclusion:
Based on the analysis above, the program correctly implements the required functionality outlined in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
