The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It is designed to handle a non-negative integer `n` within the range of 0 to 10^9, which is likely referenced internally or through some other means not visible in the function signature. However, based on the provided constraints, the function will return a value based on the properties of `n` if it were to be used. Since there is no specific output detailed, we cannot delineate further return cases. Therefore, the functionality of the function is unspecified in terms of its output based solely on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output functionality is unspecified based on the provided constraints.**
