The code snippet simply prints the string '0' to the output. It does not affect the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`, which retain their previous values. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= x, y, z <= 100`, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, and `x` is greater than or equal to `y`. The current value of `x` is equal to `y`, and `z` is equal to 0. The output printed is '0'.**
