To verify the correctness of the provided program against the given problem description, we need to analyze how the program handles the input values \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) and how it determines the output.

### Breakdown of the Program Logic:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) which represent the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes respectively.

2. **Conditions Evaluated**:
   - **Condition 1**: `if (x > y + z)` 
     - If true, it prints `'+'`, indicating there are definitely more upvotes than possible downvotes (including unknowns).
   - **Condition 2**: `if (x < y)` 
     - If true, it prints `'-'`, indicating there are definitely more downvotes than upvotes.
   - **Condition 3**: `if (x == y)` 
     - If true, it checks if:
       - `if (z == 0)`: Prints `'0'`, indicating equal upvotes and downvotes.
       - Else: Prints `'?'`, indicating uncertainty due to the presence of unknown votes.
   - **Else Clause**: 
     - If \( x \) is neither greater than \( y + z \) nor less than \( y \), it must be the case that \( x \) is greater than \( y \) but less than or equal to \( y + z \). Thus, it prints `'?'`, indicating uncertainty.

### Evaluation Against the Problem Description:

The problem description requires the program to determine a singular output based on the comparison of votes or to declare uncertainty:

- If \( x > y + z \): The output should be `'+'`.
- If \( x < y \): The output should be `'-'`.
- If \( x == y \):
  - If \( z == 0 \): The output should be `'0'`.
  - If \( z > 0 \): The output should be `'?'`.
- If \( x \) is between \( y \) and \( y + z \) (but not equal to \( y \)), the output should also be `'?'`.

### Conclusion:

The program logic aligns perfectly with the requirements of the problem description. It correctly assesses the relationships between \( x \), \( y \), and \( z \) to determine and output the appropriate result or declare uncertainty.

Thus, we conclude that the program meets the specifications provided in the problem description for all possible input cases.

Correctness: **True**
