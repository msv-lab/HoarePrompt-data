To determine the correctness of the given program based on the problem description, we will analyze the logic of the program in relation to the scenarios outlined in the problem.

The program does the following:
1. It reads three integers, `x`, `y`, and `z`.
2. It checks if the number of upvotes `x` is greater than the number of downvotes `y` plus the uncertain votes `z`. If true, it prints '+'.
3. It checks if `x` is less than `y`. If true, it prints '-'.
4. It checks if `x` is equal to `y`. If true, it further checks if `z` is 0. If `z` is 0, it prints '0'; otherwise, it prints '?'.
5. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints '?'.

Now, let's analyze potential cases:

1. **Case `x = 3`, `y = 7`, `z = 0`:** 
   - Expected output: '-'.
   - Logic: `3 < 7`, so it correctly prints '-'.

2. **Case `x = 2`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`:**
   - Expected output: '+'.
   - Logic: `2 > 0 + 1` (which is 1), so it correctly prints '+'.

3. **Case `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 0`:**
   - Expected output: '0'.
   - Logic: `1 == 1` and `z == 0`, so it correctly prints '0'.

4. **Case `x = 0`, `y = 0`, `z = 1`:**
   - Expected output: '?'.
   - Logic: `0 == 0`, but since `z` is not 0, it prints '?' correctly indicating uncertainty.

5. **Case `x = 1`, `y = 1`, `z = 1`:**
   - Here, we analyze this case: 
   - If the one uncertain voter upvotes, the result would be `1` upvote (1) and `1` downvote (1), resulting in '0'.
   - If the uncertain voter downvotes, the result would be `1` upvote (1) and `2` downvotes (2), resulting in '-'.
   - Thus, there are two different results possible, and the expected output should be '?'.
   - The logic in the code will evaluate `x == y` which gives it to the next check that `z` is not 0, it correctly prints '?'.

After analyzing each potential edge case and ensuring that the logic aligns with the problem statement, we find that the program correctly handles each scenario described in the problem.

Correctness: **True**.
