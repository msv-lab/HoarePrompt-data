The code `print('?')` simply prints a question mark and does not modify any variables. Therefore, the states of the variables remain unchanged. The output state includes all the previous conditions without alteration.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`; `max_upvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_downvotes`; and `max_downvotes` is greater than or equal to `min_upvotes`.**
