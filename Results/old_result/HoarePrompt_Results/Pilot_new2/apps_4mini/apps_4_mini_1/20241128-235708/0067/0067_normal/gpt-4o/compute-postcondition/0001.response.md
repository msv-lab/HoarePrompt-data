The value of `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, which is a non-negative integer and falls within the range of 0 to 100 (inclusive). The values of `y` and `z` remain unchanged, and their initial state still holds. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`.**
