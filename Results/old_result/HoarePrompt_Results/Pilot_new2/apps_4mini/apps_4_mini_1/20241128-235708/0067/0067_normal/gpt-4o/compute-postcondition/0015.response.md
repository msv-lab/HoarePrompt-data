Functionality: ** The function accepts three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` as input. It calculates the minimum and maximum possible counts of upvotes and downvotes based on these values. It then prints one of three outcomes: '-' if the maximum possible upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum possible downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, or '?' if neither condition is met. There is no explicit return value from the function. **
