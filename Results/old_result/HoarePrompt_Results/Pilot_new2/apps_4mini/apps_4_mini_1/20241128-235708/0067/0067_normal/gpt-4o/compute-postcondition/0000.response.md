The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned based on the input of three integers, which are mapped to their respective variables. These values must be non-negative integers and each should lie within the range of 0 to 100. The initial state does not provide specific values for `x`, `y`, and `z`, but after execution, they will hold the values given by the user input. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, with `x`, `y`, `z` assigned the values from `input().split()`.**
