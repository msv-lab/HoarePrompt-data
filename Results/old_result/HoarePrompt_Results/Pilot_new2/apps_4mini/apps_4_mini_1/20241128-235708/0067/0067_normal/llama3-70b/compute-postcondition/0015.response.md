Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= x, y, z <= 100`. If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is equal to 0, the output printed is '0'; otherwise, `x` remains equal to `y` with `z` greater than 0. If `x` is not equal to `y`, then `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and the output is a question mark.***
