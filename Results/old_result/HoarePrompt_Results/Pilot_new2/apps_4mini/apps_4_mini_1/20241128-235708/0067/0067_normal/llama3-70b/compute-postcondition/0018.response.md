The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with the precondition that `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers constrained within the range of 0 to 100. Since there are no details provided about the output, I will assume that the function serves a purpose related to these parameters. However, without clear output specifications, we cannot define the functionality in terms of return values or behaviors. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and operates under the assumption that x, y, and z are non-negative integers between 0 and 100.**
