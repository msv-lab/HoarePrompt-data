The code snippet `print('?')` simply outputs a question mark and does not alter any variables or their values. The conditions for the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` remain unchanged since there are no assignments or calculations performed. 

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that `0 <= x, y, z <= 100`, `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`, `x` is greater than or equal to `y`, and `x` is not equal to `y`. The output is a question mark.**
