The code `d_queue.append(i)` adds the current value of `i` to the `d_queue` list. Since `i` is initially `0`, the `d_queue` will now contain one element, which is `0`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `votes` is a non-empty string, `d_queue` is a list containing 0, `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character of `votes`, and the current value of `v` is 'D'.**
