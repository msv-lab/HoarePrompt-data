The code `r_queue.append(r_index + n)` appends the value of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. Given that `r_index` is the first element of the original `r_queue`, this means that the new element added to `r_queue` will be the sum of the first element of `r_queue` (which was there before it was modified) and `n`. The sizes of `d_queue` and `r_queue` being one less than before implies that they have been reduced but does not affect the execution of the current line of code. 

After executing the code, `r_queue` will have one additional element, which is `r_index + n`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` has one less element than before, `r_queue` has one more element (the new element is `r_index + n`), and `r_index` is unchanged (still the first element of the original `r_queue`).**
