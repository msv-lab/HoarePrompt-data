The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The initial values of `n` and `fractions` are not affected by this operation, so they remain the same. The output state reflects that `depublicans` has increased by 1 while retaining the properties of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string that must have at least 2 characters, `fraction` is the second character of `fractions`, `depublicans` is increased by 1.**
