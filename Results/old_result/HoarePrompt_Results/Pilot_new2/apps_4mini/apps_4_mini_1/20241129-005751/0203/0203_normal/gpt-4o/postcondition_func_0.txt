The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It simulates a process where indices of 'D' and 'R' characters compete against each other, with the character that appears first in the queue being re-added to the queue with an increment of `n` to its index. The function continues this process until one of the queues is empty and prints 'D' if characters 'D' remain or 'R' if characters 'R' remain.
