The variable `d_queue` is initialized as an empty list. This does not affect the values of `n` or `votes`, which remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string resulting from input with leading and trailing whitespace removed; `d_queue` is an empty list.**
