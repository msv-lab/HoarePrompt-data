The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns that value to `r_index`. Since `r_queue` must still contain at least one index, the operation is valid, and after the execution, `r_index` will hold the value of the first element that was previously in `r_queue`. 

The state of `d_queue` remains unchanged as the operation only affects `r_queue` and `r_index`.

Output State: **`d_queue` contains at least one less index, `d_index` is the value of the removed first element from `d_queue`, `r_index` is now the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`, and `r_queue` contains at least one index less than before.**
