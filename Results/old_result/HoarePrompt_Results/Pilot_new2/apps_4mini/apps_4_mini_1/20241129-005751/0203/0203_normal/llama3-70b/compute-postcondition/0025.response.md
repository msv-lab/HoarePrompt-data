Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string `fractions` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string, and prints 'D' if there are more 'D' characters than 'R' characters; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not return any value; it solely prints the result based on the counts. **
