Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `prefix_balances[i]` for `1 <= i <= n` is computed as the cumulative sum of `1`s and `-1`s based on the string `s`, `balance` is equal to `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `results` and `count` are as per the last execution, `x` is the integer value from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is the string value from `data[index + 2]`, `index` is updated to `index + 3`.**
