The value of `count` is incremented by 1. Since `count` was initially 0, the new value of `count` will be 1. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, `prefix_balances[n]` equals `balance`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and `count` is now 1.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, `prefix_balances[n]` equals `balance`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 1.**
