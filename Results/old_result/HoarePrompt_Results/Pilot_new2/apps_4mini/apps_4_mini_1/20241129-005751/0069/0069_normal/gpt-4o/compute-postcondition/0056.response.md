The `results` list is updated to append the value -1 to it. The other variables in the initial state remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[n]` equals `balance`, `prefix_balances[0]` is 0, the current value of `balance` is 0, `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, and `results` now includes -1.
