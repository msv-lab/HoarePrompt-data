The code `results.append(0)` is adding the integer value `0` to the list `results`. The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the `results` list will now include an additional `0`. The values of `T`, `n`, `i`, `prefix_balances`, `balance`, and `x` remain the same, as they are not affected by the append operation.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` is equal to the balance of '0's minus '1's from the first `i` characters of the string `s`, the current value of `balance` is 0, `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, and `results` includes an additional `0`.**
