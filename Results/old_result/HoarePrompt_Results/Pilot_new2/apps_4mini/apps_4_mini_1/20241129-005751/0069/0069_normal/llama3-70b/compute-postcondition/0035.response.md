Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100`, for each iteration: `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. After all iterations, the outputs depend on the comparisons made within each loop iteration: if `balance` equals `x`, the printed value is `n + 1` for those cases; if `balance` is not equal to `x` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed; otherwise, the printed value is `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, assuming `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, the output conditions may lead to no value being printed.**
