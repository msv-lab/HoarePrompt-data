Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ T â‰¤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 2` with `prefix_balances[0]` equal to 0, `b` is `prefix_balances[n + 1]`. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1.***
