The `print(-1)` statement outputs `-1`, but it does not change any of the values of the existing variables. The initial states of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged conditions of the variables.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`.**
