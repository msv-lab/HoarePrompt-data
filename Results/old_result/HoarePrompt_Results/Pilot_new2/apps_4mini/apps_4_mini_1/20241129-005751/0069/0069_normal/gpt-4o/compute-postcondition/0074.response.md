Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is `n`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[0]` is 0 and `prefix_balances[n]` equals `balance`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is an element of `prefix_balances`, then `results` includes -1. Otherwise, if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` has an additional value of 0. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is the number of valid `b` values such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` now includes the value of `count.***
