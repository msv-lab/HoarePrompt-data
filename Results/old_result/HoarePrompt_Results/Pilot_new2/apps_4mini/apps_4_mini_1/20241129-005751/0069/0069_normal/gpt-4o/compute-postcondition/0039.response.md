Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer, `i` is equal to `n`, and `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` represents the balance of '0's minus '1's from the first `i` characters of the string `s`. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then `results` contains `-1`. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` includes an additional `0`. If `balance` is not equal to 0, then `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `results` includes the value of `count`, where `b` is the last element of `prefix_balances`.***
