Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100` and `T` is greater than 1; `n` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the updated count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the updated count of '1' in `s`; `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the output is -1. Otherwise, the output is the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, assuming `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`.***
