The `print(-1)` statement outputs the value `-1` but does not change any variable states. The previous values of all affected variables remain the same since there are no assignments or modifications in the code provided. 

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100` and `T` must be greater than 1; `n` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the updated count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the updated count of '1' in `s`; `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`; and the output is -1.**
