The code assigns values to `n` and `x` by mapping the input string split into integers. The preconditions for `T`, `s`, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, and `balance` remain unchanged. The values of `n` and `x` will now be equal to the two integers provided in the input.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer such that `1 <= T <= 100` and `T` must be greater than 1; `n` is an input integer; `x` is an input integer; `s` is an input string; `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`; `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`; `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`.**
