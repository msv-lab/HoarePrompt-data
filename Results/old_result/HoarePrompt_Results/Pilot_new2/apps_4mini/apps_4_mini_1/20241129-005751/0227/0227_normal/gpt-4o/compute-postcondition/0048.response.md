The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The initial conditions state that `can_form` is `False`, so after execution, it is now `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` includes at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[n-1]`, `can_form` is `True`, `m` is unchanged, `i` is n, `x` is the first element of `assigned`, and the difference (a[i] - x) is an element of `assigned`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` includes at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, `a[2]`, and `a[n-1]`, `can_form` is `True`, `m` is unchanged, `i` is n, `x` is the first element of `assigned`, and the difference (a[i] - x) is an element of `assigned`.**
