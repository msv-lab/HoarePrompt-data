Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` includes at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, in which case we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
