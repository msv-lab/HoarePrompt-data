The value of `can_form` is assigned to `True`, but it is already `True` in the initial state. Therefore, the state of `can_form` remains unchanged. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` is a set containing at least the integer `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the next element in `assigned`, `can_form` is True**
