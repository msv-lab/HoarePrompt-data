The value of `m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is unknown, but it will now be `m + 1`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 2, `i` is 2, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct integers satisfying 1 <= `a_k` <= 10^9, if `a[1]` is not equal to `a[0] * 2`, then `m` is updated to `m + 1`.
