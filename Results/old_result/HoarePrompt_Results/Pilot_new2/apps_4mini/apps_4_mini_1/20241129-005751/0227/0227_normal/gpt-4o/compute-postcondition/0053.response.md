The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` must have at least 1 element, `x` is the first element of `assigned`, `can_form` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
