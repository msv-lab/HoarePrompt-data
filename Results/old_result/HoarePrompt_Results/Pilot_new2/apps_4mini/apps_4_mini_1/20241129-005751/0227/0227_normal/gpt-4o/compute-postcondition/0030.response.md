Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` includes at least `a[0]`, `a[1]`, and `a[2]`, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, and `can_form` is True if the value of `(a[i] - x)` is found in `assigned`. If `(a[i] - x)` is not in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains False.***
