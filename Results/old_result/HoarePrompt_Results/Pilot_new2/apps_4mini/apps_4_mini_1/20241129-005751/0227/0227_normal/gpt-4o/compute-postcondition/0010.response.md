Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, `assigned` is a set containing at least the integer `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
