The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 23\). The parameter `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, where each integer \(a[k]\) satisfies \(1 \leq a[k] \leq 10^9\). After executing the function body, the program returns the count of distinct groups formed, represented by the variable `m`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct positive integers `a`, and return the count of distinct groups formed. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of n distinct positive integers, and returns the count of distinct groups formed.**
