The list `a` is sorted in non-decreasing order. The variable `n` remains unchanged, as it only represents the length of the list. The values of the integers in the list `a` are rearranged but all values are still distinct positive integers within the specified range. The output state will reflect that `a` is now sorted.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23; `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, where each integer a[k] satisfies 1 ≤ a[k] ≤ 10^9.**
