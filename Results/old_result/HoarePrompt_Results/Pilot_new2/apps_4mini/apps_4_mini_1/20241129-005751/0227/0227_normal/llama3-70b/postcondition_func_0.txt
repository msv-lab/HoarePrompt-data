The function accepts a positive integer `n` from user input, representing the number of distinct integers to be processed. It then reads `n` integers, sorts them, and counts how many integers do not satisfy the condition that each element is double the previous one. The function returns this count `m`, unless `m` exceeds 23, in which case it returns -1. If there is only one integer (when `n` is 1), the function will return 1 as there are no comparisons to make. The function does not handle input validation for the constraints provided, so inappropriate inputs could lead to unexpected behavior.
