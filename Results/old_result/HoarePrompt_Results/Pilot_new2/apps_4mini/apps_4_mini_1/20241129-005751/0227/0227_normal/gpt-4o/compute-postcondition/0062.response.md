Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in non-decreasing order, and `assigned` includes elements from `a`. If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1, `i` remains `n`, and `x` is the last element of `assigned` checked. If `assigned` is empty, then `can_form` remains False.***
