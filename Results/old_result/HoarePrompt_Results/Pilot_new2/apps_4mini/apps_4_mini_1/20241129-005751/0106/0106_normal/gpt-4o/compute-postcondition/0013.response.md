The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, which are integers constrained between 1 and 1000. It also accepts parameters `a` and `b`, which are integers constrained between 1 and \( n \cdot m \cdot k \), with the condition that \( a \neq b \). 

After executing the function body, it computes and returns `total_time`, which is determined by adding `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and the product of `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. Here, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and return a computed total time based on various time calculations involving walking and exiting from a specific floor. 

Functionality: **The function accepts integers n, m, k (1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and integers a, b (1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, a ≠ b) and returns total_time based on time_to_exit, minimum walking time, and floor calculations.**
