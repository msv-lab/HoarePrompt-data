To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze it step-by-step and identify any potential edge cases where the program may not meet the requirements.

1. **Understanding the Problem**: 
   - We have a cylindrical building with `n` entrances (blocks), `m` floors, and `k` apartments per floor. 
   - Apartments are numbered from 1 to `n * m * k`.
   - Edward lives in apartment `a`, and Natasha lives in apartment `b`.
   - The time taken to move between floors and blocks are explicitly defined.

2. **Key Points in Code**:
   - The function `get_location(apartment)` calculates the block and floor of a given apartment number.
   - `time_to_exit` is calculated based on Edward's current floor.
   - The walking time between blocks is calculated in both directions (clockwise and counterclockwise).
   - The total time is computed by summing the time to exit, the minimum walking time, and the time to reach Natasha's floor.

3. **Potential Issues**:
   - The program does not correctly account for the case when Edward is already on the first floor (where `floor_a` is 1). It should not add any lift time, but the code already handles that with `time_to_exit = 0`.
   - The calculation of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` could lead to inaccuracies when `block_a` and `block_b` are both 1 or both n, especially since the modulo operation may not accurately wrap around the building correctly in some scenarios.
   - The program does not handle the case where moving between blocks could involve more than just direct and reverse walking time due to potential overlaps or miscalculations in the direction of movement.

4. **Testing Edge Cases**:
   - Consider when `n = 1`, `m = 1`, `k = 1`. Edward is in apartment 1, and Natasha is in apartment 2, which should not exist. Hence, the input validation should prevent such cases.
   - Additionally, when both apartments are on the same floor but different blocks, the program must ensure to account for the walking time accurately.

5. **Counter-examples**:
   - If Edward is in apartment 1 (Block 1, Floor 1) and Natasha is in apartment 6 (Block 1, Floor 2), the program calculates the walking time incorrectly because it does not consider that no block-switching is necessary, resulting in the output being potentially incorrect.

Considering all aspects, the program might fail in some instances where it does not accurately calculate the minimum time based on the described walking and lift conditions. Therefore, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
