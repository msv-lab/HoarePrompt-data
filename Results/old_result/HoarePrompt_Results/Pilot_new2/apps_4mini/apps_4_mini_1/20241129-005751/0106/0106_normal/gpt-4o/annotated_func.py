#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, and a and b are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.

    block_a, floor_a = get_location(a)
    block_b, floor_b = get_location(b)
    if (floor_a == 1) :

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `a` ≤ `n·m·k`; `b` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a ≠ b`; `block_a` and `floor_a` are updated with values from `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are updated with values from `get_location(b)`; if `floor_a` is 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0; otherwise, `time_to_exit` is equal to `10 + (floor_a - 1)`.
    direct_walk_time = abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15
    reverse_walk_time = (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15
    min_walk_time = min(direct_walk_time, reverse_walk_time)
    time_to_target_floor = (floor_b - 1) * 5
    total_time = time_to_exit + min_walk_time + time_to_target_floor
    return total_time
    #The program returns total_time, which is equal to time_to_exit + min_walk_time + (floor_b - 1) * 5, where min_walk_time is the minimum of direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor is calculated as (floor_b - 1) * 5
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts three integers `n`, `m`, `k` (each between 1 and 1000) and two integers `a`, `b` (each between 1 and `n·m·k` and not equal to each other). It calculates the total time required to exit from location `a` to location `b` based on the floor of `a`, the walking distances between blocks using both direct and reverse paths, and the time to reach the target floor of `b`. The function returns the total time as an integer.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: n, m, and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; a and b are integers representing apartment numbers, with 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.
def get_location(apartment):
    block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)
    floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
    return block, floor
    #The program returns the block and floor values, where block is calculated as either (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1 or (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and floor is calculated as floor_within_block // k + 1, based on the values of a and b within the constraints of positive integers.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a positive integer `apartment`, representing an apartment number, and returns a tuple containing two values: the block number and the floor number associated with that apartment. The block is calculated based on the total number of apartments per block (determined by parameters `m` and `k`), and the floor is derived from the position of the apartment within that block. The function assumes valid input within the specified ranges but does not handle input validation or cases where the apartment number exceeds the total number of apartments in the building.
