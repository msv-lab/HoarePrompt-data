The variables `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input, where the input consists of two integers separated by a space. The values of `a` and `b` must lie within the range 1 to `n·m·k`, and they must not be equal to each other. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from input values, where 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers assigned from input values, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.**
