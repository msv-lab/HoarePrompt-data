The variable `min_floor_time` is assigned the value `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. Given that `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, the difference `(a_floor - b_floor)` is a positive integer. Therefore, `min_floor_time` is calculated as a positive value multiplied by 5, plus 10. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers assigned from input values where 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers assigned from input values where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b; `a_floor` is equal to `(a - 1) % m + 1`; `a_block` is equal to `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `b_floor` is equal to `(b - 1) % m + 1`; `b_block` is equal to `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`; `min_block_time` is equal to min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15; `min_floor_time` is equal to `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`.**
