The variable `block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, and `apartment` is either `a` or `b`, which are integers representing apartment numbers. The value of `block` depends on the specific values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. 

Since `a` and `b` are both within the range of 1 to `n*m*k` and are not equal, `apartment` can be either `a` or `b`. Therefore, the value of `block` can take on different values based on which apartment number is used. Specifically, `block` will be either `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` or `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.

The outputs of the previous variables remain unchanged, aside from the new value assigned to `block`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are integers representing apartment numbers with 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k` and `a` ≠ `b`; `block` is either `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` or `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
