According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to and including `k`. Thus, for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be at least 1. The variable `n` does not affect the execution of this loop directly, and `seen` being an empty set also does not impact the loop execution. 

Before the loop starts, for it to be executed, we must ensure that `k` is at least 1, and at the start of the loop, `i` will be initialized to 1.

State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an input integer such that k must be greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
