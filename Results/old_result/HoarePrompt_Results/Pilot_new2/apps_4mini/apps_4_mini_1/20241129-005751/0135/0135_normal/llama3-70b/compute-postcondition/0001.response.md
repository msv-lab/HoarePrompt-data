The code initializes `seen` as a new empty set. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as the code does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `k`, along with the new state of `seen`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `seen` is an empty set.**
