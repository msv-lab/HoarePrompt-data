To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step-by-step.

### Problem Description Recap:
The function needs to check if the remainders of dividing a number `n` by all integers `i` from `1` to `k` are distinct. If they are distinct, it should print "Yes"; otherwise, it should print "No".

### Program Breakdown:
1. **Input Handling**: The program reads two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Set for Tracking Distinct Remainders**: It initializes an empty set called `seen` to store the remainders.
3. **Loop from `1` to `k`**: The program iterates over all integers `i` from `1` to `k`.
   - For each `i`, it calculates `remainder = n % i`.
   - It checks if this remainder is already in the `seen` set.
     - If it is, it prints "No" and exits (indicating that a duplicate remainder was found).
     - If it is not, it adds the remainder to the set.
4. **Final Output**: If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it prints "Yes".

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly calculates the remainders for all `i` in the range `[1, k]`.
- It properly checks for duplicates using a set, which is efficient for this purpose.
- The exit condition is correctly implemented to stop further checks once a duplicate is found.
- The final output is correctly based on whether any duplicates were found.

### Edge Cases:
- **Minimum Input Values**: For `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the program will compute `1 % 1 = 0`, which is distinct as there's only one value.
- **Large Values**: The program can handle values up to `10^18` for `n` and `k`, as Python natively supports large integers.
- **Potential Duplicates**: The program properly identifies when `n % i` could equal `n % j` for some `i` and `j`, particularly when `k` is small compared to `n` (as demonstrated in the examples).

### Conclusion:
The program aligns with the problem description and logic requirements, efficiently checking for distinct remainders. Therefore, it fulfills the criteria set forth in the problem statement.

Correctness: **True**
