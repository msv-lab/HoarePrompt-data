Correctness: **False**

The program provided does not correctly handle the requirements of the problem description for all cases. Specifically, while it checks for distinct remainders of `n` modulo `i` for `i` from 1 to `k`, there are certain edge cases that it fails to address.

1. **Case of k > n**: When `k` is greater than `n`, the function will start computing remainders for integers greater than `n`. The remainders for values of `i` from `n+1` to `k` will all be equal to `n` because `n % i` will always be `n` when `i` is greater than `n`. This means that for any `i` greater than `n`, the remainder will not be distinct, leading to a guaranteed "No" result, but the program does not explicitly handle this case before checking all values up to `k`. 

2. **Missing Output for Edge Cases**: The program outputs 'No' immediately upon finding a duplicate remainder but does not take into account the fact that if `k` exceeds `n`, duplicates are inevitable and should be handled more gracefully.

To summarize, while the program correctly identifies when remainders are not distinct for the range specified, it fails to account for cases where `k > n`, leading to an incorrect solution for those scenarios. Thus, it does not fully comply with the problem description for all potential cases.
