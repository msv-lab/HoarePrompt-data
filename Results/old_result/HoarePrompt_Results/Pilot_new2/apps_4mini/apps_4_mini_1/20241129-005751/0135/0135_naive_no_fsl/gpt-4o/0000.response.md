To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the code against potential edge cases.

The program is supposed to check if all the remainders of `n` divided by every integer from `1` to `k` are distinct. The output should be "Yes" if all remainders are distinct, and "No" otherwise.

### Code Analysis
1. **Input Handling**: The code takes two integers `n` and `k`.
2. **Immediate Check**: If `k >= n`, it returns "No". This is because, when `k` reaches or exceeds `n`, the remainders `n % i` for `i = n` will be `0`, and for `i = 1`, the remainder will also be `0`. Thus, there will definitely be duplicates.
3. **Set for Distinct Remainders**: The code uses a set called `seen_remainders` to track the remainders observed during the iteration.
4. **Loop from `1` to `k`**: For each integer `i` from `1` to `k`, it calculates `n % i`. If this remainder has been seen before (exists in the set), it returns "No". If not, it adds the remainder to the set.
5. **Final Return**: If the loop completes without finding duplicates, it returns "Yes".

### Edge Cases
1. **Minimum Values**: Consider the case where `n = 1` and `k = 1`. The program should return "Yes" since `1 % 1 = 0`, and there are no other divisions to consider. This will be handled correctly since there's only one remainder.
2. **Large Values**: Consider `n = 10^18` and `k = 1`. The output should be "Yes" because thereâ€™s only one division to perform (`10^18 % 1`).
3. **Values where `k` is equal to `n`**: For example, with `n = 3` and `k = 3`, the program should return "No" since both `3 % 1` and `3 % 3` produce a remainder of `0`.

### Problematic Cases
A potential problem arises when `k` is equal to `n + 1`. For example, if `n = 5` and `k = 6`, the code will handle it correctly:
- `5 % 1 = 0`
- `5 % 2 = 1`
- `5 % 3 = 2`
- `5 % 4 = 1` (duplicate detected)

However, it will return "No". The edge case where `k` is exactly `n` is handled correctly, but we need to also check when `k` is much larger than `n`, which might produce non-distinct remainders.

### Conclusion
After reviewing the logic and checking various corner cases, I have not found any instance where the code fails to handle the requirements of the problem description correctly.

Correctness: **True**  
The program correctly identifies whether all remainders of `n` divided by integers from `1` to `k` are distinct, and it handles edge cases appropriately.
