The code prints 'No', which implies a specific output but does not alter any of the existing variables. The previous values of the variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged state of the variables along with the printed output.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an input integer such that k is greater than or equal to 2, `seen` still contains `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is now `n % 2; printed output is 'No'.**
