Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an input integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to 3; `seen` contains `n % 3`; `i` is 3; `remainder` is equal to `n % 3`. If `remainder` is in `seen`, 'No' has been printed and program execution has been terminated.***
