To verify the correctness of the provided program based on the given problem description, let's analyze the code step by step:

### Problem Description Summary:
We need to determine if all remainders of `n` divided by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we are checking if there exists a pair `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k` and `n mod i = n mod j`.

### Program Examination:
```python
(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
seen = set()
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    remainder = n % i
    if remainder in seen:
        print('No')
        exit()
    seen.add(remainder)
print('Yes')
```

### Analysis:
1. The program initializes a set called `seen` to keep track of the remainders encountered.
2. It iterates from `1` to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` when divided by `i`.
3. If a remainder is already in the `seen` set, it prints 'No' and exits, indicating that there is a duplicate remainder.
4. If all remainders are unique after checking up to `k`, it prints 'Yes'.

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:
- **When `k` is greater than `n`:** When `k` exceeds `n`, all remainders from `n` mod `i` where `i` is greater than `n` will be equal to `n` itself (i.e., `n mod n = 0`, `n mod (n+1) = n`, and so forth). Thus, we might end up with non-unique remainders depending on the values of `n` and `k`.
- **When `k` equals `n`:** The code will correctly identify that `n mod n` equals `0`, which means the remainders are not all unique.

### Output Hints Examination:
The output hints describe that the program computes the unique remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from `1` to `k` and outputs 'No' if any remainder is repeated, otherwise it outputs 'Yes'. This aligns with the program's logic.

### Conclusion:
The program seems to be missing the handling of cases where `k` is greater than `n`. For `k > n`, the remainders will not be guaranteed to be distinct after `n` itself, particularly because the remainders will start repeating after `k` exceeds `n`.

### Example of a Failing Case:
- For `n = 5` and `k = 6`, the program will output 'Yes' because:
  - Remainders: `5 mod 1 = 0`, `5 mod 2 = 1`, `5 mod 3 = 2`, `5 mod 4 = 1`, `5 mod 5 = 0`, `5 mod 6 = 5`.
  - Here, `0` and `1` are repeated, but the program will return 'Yes' incorrectly.

Thus, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
