The function accepts two integers `l` and `r`, where `1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18`, and an integer `k` where `1 ≤ k ≤ 10`. It calculates and returns the difference between the results of the `count` function when called with `r` and `l - 1`, modulo a constant `MOD`. The function relies on memoization stored in the dictionary `dp` for efficient computation.
