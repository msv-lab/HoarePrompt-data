The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `10` to its previous value. After that, `dp[n, k]` is taken modulo `MOD`. The states of the other variables (`l`, `r`, `k`, and `n`) are not affected. Therefore, the Output State includes the updated `dp[n, k]`.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 <= `k` <= 10, `n` is greater than or equal to 10, `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + 10 and then taken modulo `MOD`.**
