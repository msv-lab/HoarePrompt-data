According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. The loop will execute again if `num` is less than or equal to `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` has been incremented by 1 and must remain less than or equal to `r`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be `r`, and `total_sum` will be equal to `((num % MOD) + (num + 1)) % MOD` when `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true.

State: **`total_sum` is equal to `((num % MOD) + (num + 1)) % MOD` when `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `num` is `r`, `l` is unchanged, and `r` is unchanged**
