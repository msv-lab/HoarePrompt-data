The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The previous value of `total_sum` was `num % MOD`. After incrementing `num` by 1, it will not affect the result of the modulus operation directly, but the value of `total_sum` will change based on the new value of `num`. 

Thus, the new value of `total_sum` is calculated as follows:
- New `num` = `num + 1`
- New `total_sum` = `(total_sum + num) % MOD`
- Since `total_sum` was originally `num % MOD`, the new `total_sum` becomes `((num % MOD) + (num + 1)) % MOD`

The state of the other variables remains unchanged in the description. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is now equal to `((num % MOD) + (num + 1)) % MOD`, `num` is now incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `r`.

Output State: **`total_sum` is now equal to `((num % MOD) + (num + 1)) % MOD`, `num` is incremented by 1 and must be less than or equal to `r.**
