#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns a boolean value indicating whether the number of unique characters in the string representation of n is less than or equal to k, where n is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts an integer `n` and an integer `k`. It returns `True` if the number of unique characters in the string representation of `n` is less than or equal to `k`; otherwise, it returns `False`. The function correctly handles the given constraints for `n` and `k` as specified.

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `total_sum` is equal to the sum of all `num` in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, modulo `MOD`; `l` is the lower bound of the range, `r` is the upper bound of the range. If no `num` satisfies the condition, `total_sum` remains 0.
    return total_sum
    #The program returns total_sum, which is equal to the sum of all `num` in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(num, k)` returns true, modulo `MOD`. If no `num` satisfies the condition, total_sum remains 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers `l` and `r` that define a range, and an integer `k`. It calculates and returns the sum of all integers `num` within the range `[l, r]` for which the function `func_1(num, k)` returns true, taking the result modulo `MOD`. If no integers in this range satisfy the condition, the function returns 0.
