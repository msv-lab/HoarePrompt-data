The annotated program provided has two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. Let's analyze them in the context of the problem description.

1. **Function `func_1(n, k)`**:
   - This function checks if the number of unique digits in the integer `n` is less than or equal to `k`. It does this by converting `n` to a string, creating a set of the characters (digits) in that string, and comparing the length of that set with `k`.
   - The function correctly implements the requirement of determining whether a number contains at most `k` different digits.

2. **Function `func_2(l, r, k)`**:
   - This function initializes a variable `total_sum` to zero and iterates over all integers in the range from `l` to `r` inclusive.
   - For each number in this range, it calls `func_1(num, k)` to check if the number has at most `k` different digits.
   - If the condition is satisfied, it adds the number to `total_sum` and takes the sum modulo `MOD`.
   - However, there is a critical error here. The variable `MOD` is not defined in the provided code, which will lead to a runtime error. The problem description specifies that the result should be printed modulo `998244353`, but this value is not being used in the code.

Additionally, while the logic of checking for valid numbers and summing them is correct, the iterative approach (`for num in range(l, r + 1)`) is not efficient for the input limits (where `l` and `r` can be as large as `10^18`). The approach will take an impractically long time for large ranges, and thus will not work within reasonable time constraints.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description due to:
- The undefined variable `MOD`, which leads to an error.
- The inefficiency of the approach for large values of `l` and `r`.

Thus, the program does not always do what the problem description asks for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**
