`digits` is assigned a new empty set. No other variables are affected by this operation. The previous values of `n` and `cubes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers from input; `digits` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers from input; `digits` is an empty set.**
