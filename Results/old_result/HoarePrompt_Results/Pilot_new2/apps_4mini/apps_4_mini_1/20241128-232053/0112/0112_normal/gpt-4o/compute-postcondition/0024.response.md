To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop iterates over the variable `digit` in the list `digits`. Since the state specifies that `digits` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute as long as there are more elements in `digits` to iterate over.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is the last index that was iterated over in the range of `n`, which means that when the loop executes next, it will take the next `digit` from the `digits` list.

To execute again, the index `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and we must ensure that there are more `digits` to iterate over. Thus, we need to adjust the index to reflect the next iteration.

Given that `i` is the last index iterated over, if `i` is currently the last index of `digits`, we also need to ensure that `i + 1` is still within the bounds of the `digits` list.

Thus, the following adjustments are necessary:

1. Increment `i` by 1 to prepare for the next iteration.
2. Ensure that `digits` still has enough elements to iterate over, which means `i + 1` must be less than the length of `digits`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where all elements are set to `True` if they matched the condition with `digit` in `cube_faces[i]`, or remain `False` if they did not; `digits` has at least 1 element; `digit` is the next element in `digits` from index `i + 1`; `found` is `True`; `i` is incremented by 1**
