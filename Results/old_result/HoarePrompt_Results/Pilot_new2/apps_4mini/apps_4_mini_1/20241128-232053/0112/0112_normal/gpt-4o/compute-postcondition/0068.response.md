Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where elements are set to `True` for all cubes that matched the corresponding digits in `digits`, and remain `False` for those that did not; `digits` contains elements indicating the digits processed; `digit` is the last element in `digits`; `found` is `True` if at least one match was found during all iterations, otherwise it could be `False` if no matches were found for a `digit`.**
