The code `used_cubes[i] = True` assigns the value `True` to the element at index `i` in the list `used_cubes`. The variable `i` is currently equal to 1. Therefore, the element `used_cubes[1]` will be set to `True`. The values of `n` and `used_cubes` do not change, but the state of `used_cubes` will be modified.

The value of `n` remains within the range of 1 to 3, `i` remains 1, and `used_cubes` will have its second element (index 1) set to `True`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 1, `used_cubes[1]` is True, and the other elements of `used_cubes` remain the same.**
