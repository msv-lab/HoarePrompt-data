According to the code, for the loop to execute, the variable `n` must be at least 1, which is already satisfied since it is specified that \(1 \leq n \leq 3\). The variable `i` starts from 0 and will increment with each iteration of the loop, so at the start of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 0.

The loop will execute `n` times, so the only requirement is that `n` must be greater than 0, which it is. The `used_cubes` list is already provided to be of length `n`, ensuring there are items to be processed if needed in the loop body.

Additionally, since `digit` is defined as the next element in `digits` following the last processed index, it is necessary to ensure that the last processed index is valid and that `digit` has been correctly assigned to avoid out-of-bound errors.

Thus, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute correctly:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `i` is 0, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, `digits` has at least 2 elements, `digit` is the next element in `digits` following the last processed index, and `found` is `False`**
