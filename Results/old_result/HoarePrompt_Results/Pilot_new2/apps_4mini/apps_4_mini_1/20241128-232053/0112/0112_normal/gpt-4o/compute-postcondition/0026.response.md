According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will execute for `n` iterations, starting from `i = 0` to `i = n-1`. 

Given the state before the loop starts:
- `n` is between 1 and 3, so `n` is valid for loop execution.
- `i` is incremented by 1, which means before the loop starts, `i` must be 0 to allow the loop to execute.

The variables `used_cubes` will also depend on the value of `n`, but since the loop's execution is governed primarily by `n` and `i`, `used_cubes` doesn't need to be adjusted for the loop to start.

The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
- Ensure `i` is reset to 0 to start the loop correctly.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`, `digits` has at least 1 element, `digit` is the next element in `digits` from index `0`, `found` is `False`, `i` is 0**
