Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where all elements are set to `True` if they matched the condition with `digit` in `cube_faces[i]`, or remain `False` if they did not; `digits` has at least 1 element; `digit` is an element of `digits`; `found` is `True` indicating that at least one match was found during the iterations; `i` is the last index iterated over in the range of `n`.***
