Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 3, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where `used_cubes[0]` is `True`, `used_cubes[1]` is `True`, and if `not used_cubes[i]` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[2]` is set to `True` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, `used_cubes[2]` remains `False`. `digits` contains at least 1 element, `digit` is an element of `digits`, and `found` is `True`, while `i` is 2.***
