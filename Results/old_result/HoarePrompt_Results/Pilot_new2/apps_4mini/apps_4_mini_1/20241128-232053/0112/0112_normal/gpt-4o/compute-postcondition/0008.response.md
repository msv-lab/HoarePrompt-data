The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. The conditions and states of the other variables remain valid. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with the first element set to `True` and the remaining elements set to `False`; `digits` has at least 1 element; `digit` is an element of `digits`; `found` is True; `i` is 0; `used_cubes[i]` is `True`; `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
