The code execution contains a `break` statement, which causes an immediate exit from the loop or the most internal structure that is being executed. This does not change the values of any variables, but the state reflects that we have exited from the current loop or if statement.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be at least 3, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[0]` as `True`, `used_cubes[1]` as `True`, and `used_cubes[2]` as `True`, `digits` has at least 1 element, `digit` is an element of `digits`, `found` is `True`, `i` is 2, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
