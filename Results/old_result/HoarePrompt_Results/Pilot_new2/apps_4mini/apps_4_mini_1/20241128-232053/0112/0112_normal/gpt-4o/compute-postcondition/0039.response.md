The value of `found` is assigned `True`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `used_cubes`, and `found`) remain unchanged as the code does not affect them. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` has `used_cubes[i]` set to True for the current value of `i`, which is either 1 or 2; `found` is True.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` has `used_cubes[i]` set to True for the current value of `i`, which is either 1 or 2; `found` is True.**
