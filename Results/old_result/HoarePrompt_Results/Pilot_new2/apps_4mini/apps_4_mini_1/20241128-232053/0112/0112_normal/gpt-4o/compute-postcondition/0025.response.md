The value of `found` is assigned `False`, which overrides its previous value of `True`. The states of the other variables remain intact. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` where all elements are set to `True` or `False`; `digits` has at least 1 element; `digit` is the next element in `digits` from index `i + 1`; `found` is `False`; `i` is incremented by 1**
