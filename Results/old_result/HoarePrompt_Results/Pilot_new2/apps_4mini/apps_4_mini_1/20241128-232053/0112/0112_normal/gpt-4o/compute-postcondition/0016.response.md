The code assigns `True` to `used_cubes[i]`, specifically `used_cubes[2]`, since `i` is equal to 2. Previously, `used_cubes[2]` was `False`, and now it is updated to `True`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[0]` as `True`, `used_cubes[1]` as `True`, and `used_cubes[2]` as `True`, `digits` has at least 1 element, `digit` is an element of `digits`, `found` is `True`, `i` is 2, and `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]**
