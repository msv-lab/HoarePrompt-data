Correctness: **False**

The program fails to correctly determine the maximum integer \( x \) that Masha can create using the cubes. It incorrectly assumes that simply collecting the unique digits from all cubes is sufficient to construct the numbers from 1 to \( x \). 

For example, consider the following input:

```
3
1 2 3 4 5 6
0 0 0 0 0 0
1 2 3 4 5 6
```

In this case, Masha cannot create any numbers from 1 to 6 because the second cube (which has all zeros) does not contribute to creating any non-zero numbers. Additionally, the program does not account for the need to have sufficient cubes to create multi-digit numbers. For instance, to form the number '11', Masha would need at least two cubes with the digit '1', which the program does not check.

The program only outputs the highest digit available, which does not guarantee that all numbers leading up to that digit can be formed. Therefore, as the program does not handle these scenarios correctly, it is deemed incorrect.
