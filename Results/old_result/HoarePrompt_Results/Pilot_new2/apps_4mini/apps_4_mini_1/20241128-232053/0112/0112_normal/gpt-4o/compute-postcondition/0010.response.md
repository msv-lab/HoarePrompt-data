According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop iterates from `0` to `n - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `0`, which means the loop has completed its first iteration.

Given that `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 3`, and `i` is currently `0`, the next value of `i` will be `1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n`. Since `i` is now `1`, `n` must be at least `2` for the loop to execute again.

Additionally, the values of `used_cubes` and `digits` do not need to change since they do not affect the loop condition directly. However, we can assume that the loop will continue to work with the next unused cube.

State: **`n` must be at least 2, `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` with `used_cubes[0]` as `True` and `used_cubes[1]` as `False`, `digits` has at least 1 element, `digit` is an element of `digits`, `found` is `True`, `i` is 1, and `used_cubes[i]` is `False`, `digit` is an element of `cube_faces[i]`.**
