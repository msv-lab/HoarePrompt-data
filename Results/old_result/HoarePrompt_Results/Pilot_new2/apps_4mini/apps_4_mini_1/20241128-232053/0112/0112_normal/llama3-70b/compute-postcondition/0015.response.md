The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. Instead, it reads input consisting of an integer `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) followed by `n` lines, each containing 6 integers `a_{i}_{j}` (where 0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9), which represent the digits on the faces of the cubes. 

The functionality of the function is not specified in terms of output in the provided information. Therefore, I cannot describe the return value or further functionality.

Functionality: **The function reads an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and n lines of 6 integers each (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) representing the digits on the faces of the cubes.**
