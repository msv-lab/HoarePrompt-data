The value of `found` is set to `False`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n`; `digits` has at least 2 elements; `digit` is the next element in `digits` following the last processed index; `found` is `False`.
