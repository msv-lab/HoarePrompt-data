To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute at least once, we must examine the condition of the `while` loop: `char in s`. 

1. The loop will execute if `char` is found in the string `s`.
2. The state indicates that `char` is the next character in an `alphabet` and also states that there must be at least one more character left in `alphabet`. This implies that `char` is not necessarily present in `s` yet.
3. For the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `char` exists in the string `s`. Given that `s` contains the first `n` occurrences of '|', it suggests that the string `s` may lack many characters depending on the value of `n`.

To make the necessary adjustments:
- We need to ensure that the string `s` contains the `char`. One way to ensure this is to state that `char` must either be one of the characters present in `s` or we need to ensure that `s` must include `char`.

Thus, we can conclude:
- Since `char` is the next character in `alphabet`, and there is at least one more character left in `alphabet`, we can infer that `char` must be one of the characters in `s` for the loop to execute.

The adjustment needed for the loop to execute is that `s` must contain `char`.

State: **`s` must contain `char`, `res` is the original `res` concatenated with '|' repeated `n` times, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` (must have at least one more character left in `alphabet`)**
