The variable `res` is incremented by adding the value of `char` to it. The initial information states that `s` contains the updated `char`, calculated as `chr(ord(char) + 1)`, which means `char` is one character ahead of `s`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` must contain the updated `char`, which is `chr(ord(char) + 1)`; `res` is equal to `res + char`.**
