The value of `i` is incremented by 1. The value of `target` remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` remains 26, and the value of `j` depends on the previous comparison between `s[i]` and `target[j]`. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is an input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented to 1, otherwise `j` remains 0; and `i` is increased by 1.
