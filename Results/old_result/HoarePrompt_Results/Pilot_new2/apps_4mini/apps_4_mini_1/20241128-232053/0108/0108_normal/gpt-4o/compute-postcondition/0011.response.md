Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is now greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 25; otherwise, no changes are made to the state of the program.***
