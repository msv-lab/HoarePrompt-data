According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the length of the string `s` and `j` is less than `target_len` (which is 26). Right before the loop, `i` is 0, which is less than `len(s)`, and `j` is also 0, which is less than 26 (the value of `target_len`). This means that both conditions for the loop to execute are satisfied.

Therefore, no adjustments are necessary for the loop to execute one time. 

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0; `j` is 0**
