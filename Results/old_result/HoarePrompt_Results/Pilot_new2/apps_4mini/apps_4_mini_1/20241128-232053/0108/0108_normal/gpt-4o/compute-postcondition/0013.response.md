To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the provided state and the `while` loop condition.

The `while` loop condition is `i < len(s) and j < target_len`. For the loop to execute again, both conditions must be met:

1. `i` must be less than `len(s)`: This means that there are still characters in the string `s` that can be processed. Since `i` is incremented by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, if `i` is currently at the last index (i.e., `i` is equal to `len(s) - 1`), then it needs to be adjusted to allow the loop to process one more character.
   
2. `j` must be less than `target_len`: This indicates that the matching process with the `target` string is not yet complete, as `target_len` is 26. If `j` is currently at 25 (the last index of `target`), the loop cannot execute again because `j` would no longer be less than `target_len`. Therefore, it must be adjusted to allow `j` to be less than 25.

Given that the state specifies that `j` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 25, we know that `j` is currently valid to allow the loop to execute again, as long as `i` is also valid.

In summary, we need to ensure that `i` remains less than `len(s)` after being incremented by 1. If `i` is at `len(s) - 1`, it must be adjusted to `len(s)` to allow for one more iteration.

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- If `i` is currently equal to `len(s) - 1`, it needs to be set to `len(s)` to allow one more iteration.
- No changes are needed for `j` since it is already less than `target_len`.

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of 1 to 100,000 lowercase English letters; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` must be less than `len(s)`**
