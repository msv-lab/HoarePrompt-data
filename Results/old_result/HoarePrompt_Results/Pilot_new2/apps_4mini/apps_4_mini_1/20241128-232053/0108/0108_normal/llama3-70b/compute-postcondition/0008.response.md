`res` is assigned the value of `res` concatenated with `char`. The value of `res` was initially 'a', and `char` is 'b'. Therefore, after the operation, `res` becomes 'ab'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'ab', `char` must be 'b'**
