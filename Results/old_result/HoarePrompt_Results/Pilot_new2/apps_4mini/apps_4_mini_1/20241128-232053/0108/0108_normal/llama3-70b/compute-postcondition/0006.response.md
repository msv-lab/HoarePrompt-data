The variable `s` is modified by replacing the first occurrence of `char`, which is 'a', with the next character in the ASCII sequence. The next character after 'a' is 'b', so `s` will now be 'b'. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is 'b', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
