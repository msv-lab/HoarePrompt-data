The string `s` has its first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in ASCII, which is `chr(ord(char) + 1)`. The variable `res` is updated to `res + char`, meaning it now includes the original `char` before the replacement. Other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`s` contains the modified string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in ASCII; `res` is updated to `res + char`.**
