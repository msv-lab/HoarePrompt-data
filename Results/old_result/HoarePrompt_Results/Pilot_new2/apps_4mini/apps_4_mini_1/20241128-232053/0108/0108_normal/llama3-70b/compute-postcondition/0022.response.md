`res` is updated by appending the current value of `char` to it. The previous state of `res` is now known, but the new value will be `res + char`. The state of `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains the modified string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in ASCII; `res` is updated to `res + char`.

Output State: **`s` contains the modified string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in ASCII; `res` is updated to `res + char`.**
