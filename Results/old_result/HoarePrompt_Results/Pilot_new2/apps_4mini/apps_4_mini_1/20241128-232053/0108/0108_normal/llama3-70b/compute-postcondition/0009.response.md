The variable `s` is modified by replacing the first occurrence of the character `b` with the character that follows it in the alphabet, which is `c`. The `char` variable is `b`, so `s` will change from `'b'` to `'c'`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` is 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'ab', `char` must be 'b'**
