The variable `res` is assigned the value of itself plus the value of `char`. The value of `char` is not specified in the initial state, but `s` must contain '|'. Since `res` was not mentioned in the initial state, we cannot determine its previous value. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`s` must contain '|'; `res` is updated to `res + char`**
