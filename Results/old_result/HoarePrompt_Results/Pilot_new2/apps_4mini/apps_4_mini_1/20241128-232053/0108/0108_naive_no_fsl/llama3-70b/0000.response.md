Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle all cases as described in the problem statement. Specifically, it fails to ensure that the output string actually contains the characters needed to form the subsequence "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" from the input string. 

For example, consider the input:

```
aabbccddeeffgg
```

The expected output for this input should be:

```
-1
```

This is because it is impossible to form the complete alphabet as a subsequence from the given string since letters 'h', 'i', 'j', 'k', 'l', 'm', 'n', 'o', 'p', 'q', 'r', 's', 't', 'u', 'v', 'w', 'x', 'y', 'z' are missing. 

However, the program would add 'a', 'b', 'c', 'd', 'e', 'f', and 'g' correctly and then attempt to replace 'g' with 'h', but since 'h' is not present, it would exit the loop incorrectly concluding that it has a valid output.

Thus, this program produces incorrect results for inputs where not all alphabet characters can be modified or do not exist in the input string.
