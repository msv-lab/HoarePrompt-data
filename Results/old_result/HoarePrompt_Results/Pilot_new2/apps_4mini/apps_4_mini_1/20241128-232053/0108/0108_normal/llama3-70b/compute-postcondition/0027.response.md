Since the code `res += char` appends `char` to the string `res`, the value of `res` changes while `s`, `n`, and `char` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the updated value of `res` after concatenating `char`.

Output State: **`s` must contain `char`, `res` is the original `res` concatenated with `char`, `char` is the next character in `alphabet`, and `n` remains unchanged.**
