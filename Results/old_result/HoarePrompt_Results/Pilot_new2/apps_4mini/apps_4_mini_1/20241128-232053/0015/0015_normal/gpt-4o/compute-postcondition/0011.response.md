Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers input by the user, with `b` not equal to `a`, and `c` not equal to 0. If the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if the difference is not divisible by `c` or the result of the division is less than 0, 'NO' is printed.***
