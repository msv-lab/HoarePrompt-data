The code prints 'YES', but it does not change the values of any variables. The initial state remains valid after execution, and thus the output reflects the unchanged variables. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers that are equal to the three integers input by the user; the current value of `b` is equal to the current value of `a`; 'YES' has been printed.**
