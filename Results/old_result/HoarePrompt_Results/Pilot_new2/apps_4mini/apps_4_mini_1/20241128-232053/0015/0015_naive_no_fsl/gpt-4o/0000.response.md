Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle all potential edge cases correctly. 

For example:
1. If `a = 1`, `b = 1`, and `c = 0`, then the output should be "YES" (since `b` is exactly equal to `a`), and the program handles this correctly.
2. If `a = 1`, `b = 7`, and `c = 3`, then `7` can be generated from the sequence `1, 4, 7`, and the program outputs "YES" correctly.
3. If `a = 10`, `b = 10`, and `c = 0`, the output should be "YES" since `b` is equal to `a`, which is again handled correctly by the program.
4. If `a = 1`, `b = -4`, and `c = 5`, the output should be "NO" as the sequence starts from `1` and incrementing by `5` will never reach `-4`. The program handles this case correctly as well.
5. If `a = 0`, `b = 60`, and `c = 50`, the output should be "NO" since the sequence will be `0, 50, 100, ...` and will never reach `60`. This case is also handled correctly by the program.

However, let's consider an additional case:
- If `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `c = 3`, the output should be "NO", since the sequence will be `1, 4, 7, ...`, and `2` is not included. But the program outputs "NO" which is correct in this scenario.
  
The failure comes under the case where `c < 0`. If `a = 10`, `b = 5`, and `c = -5`, the correct output should be "YES" since the sequence would be `10, 5, 0, ...` and includes `5`. However, the program checks `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which would yield a negative value and wrongly conclude that `b` is not in the sequence, leading to an incorrect "NO" output.

Thus, the program does not correctly handle cases where `c` is negative, which can lead to incorrect outputs.
