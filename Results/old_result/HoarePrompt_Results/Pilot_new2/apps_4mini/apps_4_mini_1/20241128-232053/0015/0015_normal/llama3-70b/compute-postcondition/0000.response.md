The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned from the input values, where `input()` accepts a space-separated string of integers and `map(int, input().split())` converts them to integers. Therefore, the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` will depend on the specific integers provided as input. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values**.
