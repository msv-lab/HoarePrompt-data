Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements outlined in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, which aligns with the problem description.

2. **First Element Check**: The program checks if `b` is equal to `a`. If they are equal, it prints "YES", which is correct because `b` appearing in the sequence would mean it is the first element.

3. **Difference Check**: When `b` is not equal to `a`, the program checks if `c` is zero:
   - If `c` is zero, the sequence consists of the same value `a` repeated indefinitely. Since `b` (if not equal to `a`) cannot appear in this constant sequence, it correctly prints "NO".

4. **Divisibility Check**: If `c` is not zero, the program checks two conditions:
   - Whether the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c`, which ensures that `b` can be reached from `a` by adding multiples of `c`.
   - Whether `(b - a) / c` is non-negative. This condition ensures that the sequence can reach `b` positively, meaning you can only move forward in the sequence starting from `a`.

5. **Output Decision**: Depending on the results of these checks, the program appropriately prints "YES" if both conditions are satisfied, or "NO" otherwise.

The program covers all edge cases:
- When `c` is zero.
- When `b` is less than `a` and `c` is positive.
- When `b` is greater than `a` and `c` is negative.

Thus, the logic is sound and all potential scenarios as described in the problem are addressed correctly. Hence, the result is accurate.

Therefore, the program meets the problem requirements for all possible cases.
