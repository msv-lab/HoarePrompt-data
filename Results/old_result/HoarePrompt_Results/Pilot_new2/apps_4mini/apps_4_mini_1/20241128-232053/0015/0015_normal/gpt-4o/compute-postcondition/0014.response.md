The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses. However, the parameters `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, constrained within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. The specific output or behavior of the function is not provided. Therefore, without additional information about the function's output, we cannot determine its functionality.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters directly, but it operates on integers a, b, and c within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. The specific output of the function is not defined.**
