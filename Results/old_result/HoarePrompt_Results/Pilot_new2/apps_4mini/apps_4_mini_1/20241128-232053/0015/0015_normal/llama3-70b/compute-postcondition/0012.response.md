Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. Since `c` is not equal to 0, if the difference `b - a` is divisible by `c` and the quotient `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, the output 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, if either `b - a` is not divisible by `c` or `(b - a) / c` is negative, the output 'NO' is printed.***
