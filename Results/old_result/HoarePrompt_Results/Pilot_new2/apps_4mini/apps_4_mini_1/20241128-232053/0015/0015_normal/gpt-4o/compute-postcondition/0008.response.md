The code simply prints 'YES' without changing any variable values. The initial conditions regarding the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` remain valid after the execution of the code. Therefore, the output state retains all the precondition information.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers that are equal to the three integers input by the user, `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0. The difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c`, and the result of the division `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0; 'YES' is printed.**
