To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we will analyze the program logically based on the input scenarios given.

### Problem Analysis:
The problem requires us to check if a number `b` appears in a sequence defined by:
- The first element `s_1 = a`
- The difference between consecutive elements is `c`.

The sequence can be expressed as:
- `s_1 = a`
- `s_2 = a + c`
- `s_3 = a + 2c`
- ...
- `s_i = a + (i-1)c`

We need to determine if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`. This can be rearranged to check if:
- `(b - a) / c` is a non-negative integer.

### Program Analysis:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if b == a:
    print('YES')
elif c == 0:
    print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

1. **Case: `b == a`**
   - If `b` is equal to `a`, the output is "YES", which is correct.

2. **Case: `c == 0`**
   - If the difference `c` is zero, the sequence will be constant (all elements will be `a`). The output should be "YES" if `b` equals `a`, but the program outputs "NO" in this case. This is incorrect.

3. **Case: General Non-zero `c`**
   - For non-zero `c`, we check if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`.
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it correctly implies that `b` can be formed by starting from `a` and adding `c` repeatedly.

### Example of Failure:
Consider the input case where `a = 10`, `b = 10`, and `c = 0`.
- According to the problem description, since the sequence is constant (all terms equal to `10`), `b` (which is also `10`) should indeed appear in the sequence, so the expected output should be "YES". However, the program incorrectly outputs "NO".

### Conclusion:
Since the program fails to correctly handle the case where `c == 0` and `b == a`, we can conclude that the correctness is:

Correctness: **False**.
