Let's analyze the provided code against the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The problem requires us to determine if a favorite integer `b` appears in an arithmetic sequence defined by the first element `a` and a common difference `c`. The sequence is defined as:
- \( s_1 = a \)
- \( s_i = a + (i-1) \cdot c \)

We need to check if there exists a positive integer \( i \) such that \( s_i = b \).

### Code Analysis:
```python
(a, b, c) = map(int, input().split())
if c == 0:
    if a == b:
        print('YES')
    else:
        print('NO')
elif (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0:
    print('YES')
else:
    print('NO')
```

### Logic Breakdown:
1. **When `c` is 0**:
   - The sequence does not change; all elements are equal to `a`.
   - If `a == b`, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO".
   - This handles the special case correctly since if `c` is 0, the sequence is constant.

2. **When `c` is not 0**:
   - It checks if `(b - a) % c == 0`, which determines if `b` can be reached from `a` using increments of `c`.
   - It also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0`, ensuring that we can reach `b` from `a` by moving forward (i.e., not going in the opposite direction).
   - If both conditions are satisfied, it prints "YES"; otherwise, "NO".

### Output Hints:
The output hints summarize the code correctly:
- For `c == 0`, it checks if `a` equals `b`.
- For `c != 0`, it checks divisibility and if the movement toward `b` is valid based on the sign.

### Edge Cases:
Now we need to think of any edge cases:
- **Case 1**: If `a = 1`, `b = 2`, and `c = 3`, then `b` cannot be reached.
- **Case 2**: If `a = -1`, `b = -4`, and `c = 5`, it will return "NO" correctly since the sequence will be `-1, 4, 9, ...`, and `-4` is not in the sequence.
- **Case 3**: If `a = 10`, `b = 10`, and `c = 0`, it should return "YES".

All of these cases seem to be covered correctly by the code.

### Final Assessment:
After reviewing both the code and the hints, the code appears to handle all specified scenarios correctly, including edge cases. There are no situations where the program fails to meet the problem requirements.

Thus, the final conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**.
