In the given code snippet, the value of `min_lemon` is calculated based on the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The expression inside the `print` statement uses `min_lemon` to compute the final output. The specific result of the print statement depends on the input values for `a`, `b`, and `c`.

1. `min_lemon` is calculated as the minimum of the three values: `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
2. The expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` can be simplified to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4)`, which equals `min_lemon * 7`.

Since no variables are altered except for the calculation of the expression that is printed, the output state reflects the unchanged inputs and includes the computation represented by `min_lemon * 7`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and the output value is `min_lemon * 7`.**
