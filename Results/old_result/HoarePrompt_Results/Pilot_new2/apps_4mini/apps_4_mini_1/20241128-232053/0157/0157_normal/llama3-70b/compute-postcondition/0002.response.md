The variable `c` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state indicates that `c` is a positive integer representing the number of pears. After the assignment, `c` will be updated to the new integer input. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input integer**
