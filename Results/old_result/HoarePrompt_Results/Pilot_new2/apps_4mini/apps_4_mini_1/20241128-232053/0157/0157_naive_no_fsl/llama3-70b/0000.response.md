To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program step by step:

1. **Understanding the Problem**: Nikolay needs to cook a compote using fruits in the ratio of 1 lemon: 2 apples: 4 pears. Given the quantities of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c), we are to calculate the maximum total number of fruits he can use.

2. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads three positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears.

3. **Logic for Maximum Fruits**:
   - The program calculates the maximum number of sets of fruits (min_lemon) he can use based on the available quantities:
     - For every lemon used, he needs 2 apples and 4 pears.
     - Therefore, the number of complete sets of fruits he can make is limited by:
       - `a` (number of lemons)
       - `b // 2` (number of apples divided by 2)
       - `c // 4` (number of pears divided by 4)
   - The program finds the minimum of these three values, which represents the maximum number of complete sets Nikolay can create.

4. **Output Calculation**: The total number of fruits used in the compote would then be:
   - `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * (1 + 2 + 4) = min_lemon * 7`.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - It is necessary to check if there are cases where Nikolay cannot use any fruits, which should return 0. Given the inputs, if any of the calculated minimums (lemons, apples, or pears) results in `0`, then the output should indeed be `0`, which the program handles correctly via the min function.

6. **Testing with Provided Examples**:
   - For the input (2, 5, 7): The program calculates `min(2, 5//2, 7//4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`, resulting in output `7`.
   - For (4, 7, 13): The calculation results in `min(4, 7//2, 13//4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`, resulting in output `21`.
   - For (2, 3, 2): The calculation results in `min(2, 3//2, 2//4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`, resulting in output `0`.

The program passes all the described test cases and handles edge cases correctly. 

Since I cannot find any cases where the logic fails or produces incorrect results based on the problem description, I conclude:

Correctness: **True** 

The program is correct because it accurately calculates the maximum total number of fruits according to the specified ratios and correctly handles the scenario where no fruits can be used.
