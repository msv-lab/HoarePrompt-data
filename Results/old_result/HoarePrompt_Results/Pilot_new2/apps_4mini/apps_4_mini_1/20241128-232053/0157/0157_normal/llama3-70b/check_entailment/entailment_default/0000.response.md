The program aims to calculate the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to create a compote based on the specified ratio of 1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears respectively. The approach taken in the code seems to correctly compute the maximum number of sets of fruits that can be formed using the input values.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The program reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`).
2. It determines `min_lemon` as the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. This correctly identifies the maximum number of complete sets of fruits that can be used based on the input.
3. Finally, it computes the total number of fruits used in these complete sets by calculating `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`.

### Edge Cases:
1. If `b` (apples) is less than 2 or `c` (pears) is less than 4, then `min_lemon` will be zero, meaning no sets can be formed.
2. The program does not check for inputs outside the specified range (1 to 1000), but the problem guarantees that the inputs will always fall within this range according to the description.

### Output Hints Verification:
The output hints mention that the function prints the result based on the computation of complete sets. They confirm that:
- The function does indeed calculate the minimum number of complete sets correctly.
- The total fruits used is printed accurately based on the formula derived from `min_lemon`.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program correctly implements the logic to find the number of complete sets of fruits according to the required ratios and handles edge cases (like when there are not enough apples or pears), I do not find any potential cases where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **True**.
