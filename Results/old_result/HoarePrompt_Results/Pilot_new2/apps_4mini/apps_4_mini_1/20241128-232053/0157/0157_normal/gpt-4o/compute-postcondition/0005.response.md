The code simply prints the value of `total_fruits`, which is calculated as `max_lemons * 7`. The initial state gives us the expression for `max_lemons`, but we do not have specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c`, so the output will reflect that `total_fruits` is based on the derived expression.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`, and `total_fruits` is printed.**
