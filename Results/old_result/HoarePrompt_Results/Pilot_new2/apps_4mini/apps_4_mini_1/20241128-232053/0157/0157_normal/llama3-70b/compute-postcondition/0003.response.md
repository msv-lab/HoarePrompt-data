In this case, `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, but `min_lemon` will take on a specific value based on the calculations. 

Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables and the new assignment for `min_lemon`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input positive integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**.
