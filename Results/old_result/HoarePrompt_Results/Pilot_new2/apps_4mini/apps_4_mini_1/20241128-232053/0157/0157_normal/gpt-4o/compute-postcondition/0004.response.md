The variable `total_fruits` is assigned the value based on the calculation involving `max_lemons`, which is defined as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. The values of `max_lemons` influence `total_fruits`, as it is multiplied by 1, 2, and 4 respectively in the formula. The other variables (`a`, `b`, `c`) remain unchanged in terms of their definitions. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, and `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `total_fruits` being `max_lemons * 7`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, `total_fruits` is `max_lemons * 7`**.
