Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 30; `m` is an integer such that 1 <= m <= 30; `r` is an input integer; `s` is a list of n integers derived from input; `b` is a list of m integers derived from input where each element `b[j]` satisfies 1 <= `b[j]` <= 1000; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from list `b`. The current value of `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to the current value of `min_buy_price`.***
