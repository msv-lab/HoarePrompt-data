Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, `m` is an integer such that 1 <= `m` <= 30, if `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`, `shares` is set to `r // s[i]`, and `i` is still 0 with the current value of `r` now less than `s[i]`. Otherwise, if `r` is less than `s[i]`, the value of `shares` remains 0, `i` is 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
