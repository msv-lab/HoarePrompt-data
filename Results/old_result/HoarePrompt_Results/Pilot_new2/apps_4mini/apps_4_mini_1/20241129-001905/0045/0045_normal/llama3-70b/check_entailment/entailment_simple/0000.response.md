Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fulfill the requirements specified in the problem description. The problem requires generating a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers whose sum equals `n` and whose greatest common divisor (GCD) is maximal. However, the annotated program only calculates the GCD of `n` and `k`, which is not relevant to constructing the required sequence.

Here are the specific ways in which the program fails:

1. **Failure to generate a sequence**: The program does not create or return any sequence of `k` numbers. It only computes the GCD of `n` and `k`, which does not address the task of forming a specific sequence that meets the criteria.

2. **Ignoring conditions for sequence creation**: The problem states that if no valid sequence can be formed, the output should be `-1`. The annotated program does not contain any logic to check whether such a sequence is possible based on the values of `n` and `k`.

3. **Lack of strict increasing order**: Even if the GCD were calculated correctly, the program does not implement any logic to ensure the sequence is strictly increasing, which is a requirement.

In summary, the program does not comply with the problem requirements as it neither constructs the required sequence nor evaluates the conditions necessary to determine the possibility of such a sequence. Therefore, it is incorrect.
