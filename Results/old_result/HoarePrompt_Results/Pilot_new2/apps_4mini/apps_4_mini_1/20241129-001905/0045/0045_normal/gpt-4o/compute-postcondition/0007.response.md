According to the given loop, the key factor for the loop's execution is the range defined by `k`. The loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, which means that `k` must be at least `1` for the loop to execute at least once. 

Given the states:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{10} \).
- `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^{10} \).
- `min_sum` is calculated as \( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \) and must satisfy \( min\_sum \leq n \).
- `d` is equal to \( \frac{n}{min_sum} \).
- `remainder` is equal to \( n - d \cdot min_sum \).
- `sequence` is a list containing \( [d, 2d, 3d, \ldots, kd] \).

The only state that needs to be adjusted to ensure that the loop executes is the value of `k`. Since `k` is already defined as a positive integer (with \( k \geq 1 \)), this condition ensures that the loop will indeed execute.

At the start of the loop:
- The variable `i` will start at `k - 1` and end at `0`. Thus, `i` needs to be initialized to `k - 1` at the start of the loop.

Therefore, the final state needs to include these adjustments:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq n \leq 10^{10} \); `k` is a positive integer such that \( 1 \leq k \leq 10^{10} \); `min_sum` is equal to \( \frac{k \cdot (k + 1)}{2} \) and \( min\_sum \leq n \); `d` is equal to \( \frac{n}{min_sum} \); `remainder` is equal to \( n - d \cdot min_sum \); `sequence` is a list containing \( [d, 2d, 3d, \ldots, kd] \); `i` is \( k - 1 \)**.
