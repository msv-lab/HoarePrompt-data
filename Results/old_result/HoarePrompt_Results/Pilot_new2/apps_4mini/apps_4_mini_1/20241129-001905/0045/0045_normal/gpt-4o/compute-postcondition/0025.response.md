The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers such that \(1 \leq n, k \leq 10^{10}\). 

If the current value of `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. If this condition is not met, the function returns a sequence list containing the values \([d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd + r]\), where \(d\) is equal to \(n/min_sum\) and \(r\) is the number of times the loop executed from 0 to \(k\).

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return either -1 if `min_sum` exceeds `n`, or a sequence list based on the calculated values of `d` and `r`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, returns -1 if `min_sum` is greater than `n`, otherwise returns a sequence list containing the values [d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd + r].**
