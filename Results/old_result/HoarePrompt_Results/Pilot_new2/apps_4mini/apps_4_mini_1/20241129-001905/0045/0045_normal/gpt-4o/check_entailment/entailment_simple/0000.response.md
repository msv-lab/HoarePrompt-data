To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we must analyze both the problem requirements and the logic implemented in the program.

### Problem Requirements

The program must:
1. Accept two positive integers `n` and `k`.
2. Generate a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers such that:
   - The sum of the sequence equals `n`.
   - The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximized.
3. If it is impossible to create such a sequence, the program should return `-1`.

### Program Analysis

Let's break down the annotated program step-by-step:

1. **Minimum Sum Calculation**:
   - The line `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2` calculates the minimum sum needed to create a strictly increasing sequence of size `k`, which is simply the sum of the first `k` natural numbers (1, 2, ..., k).
   - If `min_sum > n`, it returns `-1`, correctly identifying the case where it is impossible to create such a sequence.

2. **Divisor Calculation**:
   - The program calculates `d = n // min_sum`, which is intended to maximize the GCD of the sequence. The variable `d` represents how many times the base sequence can be scaled.
   - The `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`, which represents how much more is needed to reach `n` after accounting for the base sequence multiplied by `d`.

3. **Sequence Construction**:
   - The program constructs the initial sequence as `sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]`, which produces a sequence of the first `k` positive integers scaled by `d`.
   - The following loop adjusts the last `remainder` elements of the sequence by incrementing them by `1` to distribute any remaining value evenly among the last few elements of the sequence.

### Correctness Evaluation

The key points to consider are:
- The program generates a strictly increasing sequence.
- The sum of the generated sequence equals `n`.
- The GCD of the generated sequence is maximized by initially scaling the base sequence (1, 2, ..., k) by the largest possible `d`.

However, we must consider the case where `k` is greater than `n`. In such cases, the minimum sum `min_sum` will always exceed `n`, leading the program to correctly return `-1`.

### Conclusion

The program adheres to the problem description by handling all edge cases appropriately and generating a valid output based on the conditions specified. It correctly returns a sequence or `-1` when appropriate, and it ensures the sum and GCD conditions are satisfied.

Given this analysis, the final correctness statement is:

Correctness: **True**
