#State of the program right berfore the function call: a is a positive integer n representing the sum of the sequence, b is a positive integer k representing the number of elements in the sequence, where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `a` is the GCD of the original values of `n` and `k`, `b` is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the GCD of the original values of `n` and `k`, which is represented by variable `a`.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The code correctly handles cases where `b` is zero, as it will return `a` (which would be the GCD if `b` is initially zero). Thus, the function will always return the GCD of the two input integers.
