To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic and check if it adheres to the problem description for all possible cases.

### Key Points of the Problem:
1. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers such that their sum equals `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence must be maximal.
3. If such a sequence cannot be formed, the output should be `-1`.

### Analysis of the Given Code:
- The program starts by calculating the minimum possible sum of the first `k` positive integers, which is `k * (k + 1) / 2`. This represents the sum of the sequence `[1, 2, ..., k]`.
- If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, it correctly outputs `-1` as it's impossible to form such a sequence.
- If it is possible to form a sequence, the program calculates a multiplier `d` based on how many times the minimum sum can fit into `n` (`d = n // min_sum`).
- It constructs a sequence by multiplying each of the first `k` integers by `d`.
- Then, it distributes any remaining amount (difference between `n` and `d * min_sum`) across the sequence while ensuring it remains strictly increasing.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Distribution of Remainder**: The logic for distributing the remainder may lead to a situation where the sequence does not remain strictly increasing. For example, if the sequence generated is `[d*1, d*2, d*3]` and the remainder is evenly distributed, if the remainder is too large, it could make two or more numbers equal or cause a violation of the strictly increasing condition.
2. **GCD Calculation**: Although the program ensures that the output sequence is strictly increasing, it does not explicitly ensure that the GCD of the resulting sequence is maximized. The GCD could be less than the maximum possible if the distribution of the remainder is not handled correctly.

### Test Case to Illustrate the Issue:
Consider the input `n = 10` and `k = 3`.
- The minimum sum for `k = 3` is `1 + 2 + 3 = 6`.
- Here, `d` would be `10 // 6 = 1`.
- The initial sequence would be `[1*1, 2*1, 3*1]` which is `[1, 2, 3]`.
- The remainder is `10 - 6 = 4`.
- The distribution of the remainder may modify the sequence to `[1+2, 2+1, 3]` leading to `[3, 3, 3]`, which is invalid because it is not strictly increasing.

Given this analysis, we can conclude that while the program handles some cases correctly, it does not ensure that all cases adhere to the strictly increasing requirement while maximizing the GCD.

### Conclusion:
Correctness: **False**

The program does not always produce a valid strictly increasing sequence, particularly when the remainder distribution can cause two or more numbers to become equal.
