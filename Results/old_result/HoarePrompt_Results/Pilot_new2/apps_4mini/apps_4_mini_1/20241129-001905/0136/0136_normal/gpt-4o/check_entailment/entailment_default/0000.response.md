To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the given problem description and output hints, we need to analyze the logic of the code thoroughly.

### Problem description:
The task is to compare two very long non-negative integers, potentially containing leading zeros, and determine their relationship (less than, greater than, or equal to).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Reading Input**: The program utilizes `sys.stdin.read` to read the input in one go, which is efficient for large inputs.
   
2. **Removing Leading Zeros**: The program removes leading zeros from both integers `a` and `b` using `lstrip('0')`. If either string becomes empty after this operation, it sets it to '0'. This step is crucial for correct comparison since '00012345' should be treated as '12345'.

3. **Length Comparison**: The program first compares the lengths of `a` and `b`:
   - If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, it prints '<'.
   - Conversely, if the length of `a` is greater than that of `b`, it prints '>'.
   
4. **Lexicographical Comparison**: If both numbers are of the same length, the program then compares them lexicographically (as strings). This is valid since for strings of the same length, the lexicographical comparison works as expected for numerical values.

5. **Output**: The program prints the correct symbols based on the comparisons.

### Checking Edge Cases:
- The program correctly handles cases where both numbers are equal, different lengths, and leading zeros.
- It also correctly handles the case when both numbers are "0" (or become "0" after stripping leading zeros).

### Output Hints:
The output hints confirm that the function indeed prints the correct symbols based on the comparisons:
- It states that it will print '<', '>', or '=' based on the comparison results.
- The hints also mention the treatment of empty strings after removing leading zeros, which is correctly handled in the code.

### Conclusion:
The program logic aligns well with the problem description and handles various edge cases, including leading zeros and empty results after stripping zeros. Therefore, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

The program correctly compares two non-negative integers with respect to the problem requirements and examples provided.
