The variable `a` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means it takes the input string and removes any leading zeroes. If the input string is entirely composed of zeroes, `a` will become an empty string. The variable `b` remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeros removed; `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string containing no more than 10^6 digits and may include leading zeroes.**
