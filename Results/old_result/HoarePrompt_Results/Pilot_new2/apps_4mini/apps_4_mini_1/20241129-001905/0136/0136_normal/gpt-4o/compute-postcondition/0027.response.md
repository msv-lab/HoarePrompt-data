Functionality: ** The function reads two non-negative integers as strings from input, potentially containing leading zeros, and compares them. It prints '<' if the first integer is less than the second, '>' if it is greater, and '=' if they are equal. If either integer is an empty string after removing leading zeros, it is treated as '0'. The function correctly handles cases where the integers are long, up to \(10^6\) digits, but does not return any value; it only prints the comparison result. **
