Postcondition: ***`a` is the input string with leading zeros removed and `b` is the input string without leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output reflects this equality. If `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; otherwise, if `a` is greater than `b`, the output indicates that `a` is greater than or equal to `b.***
