Postcondition: ***`data` is a list of length 2 containing two non-negative integers as strings. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the output '<' has been printed. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths of `a` and `b` are equal, it is confirmed whether `a` is less than, greater than, or equal to `b`, while ensuring that `a` is '0' if and only if `b` is '0', and the lengths of `a` and `b` remain equal throughout.***
