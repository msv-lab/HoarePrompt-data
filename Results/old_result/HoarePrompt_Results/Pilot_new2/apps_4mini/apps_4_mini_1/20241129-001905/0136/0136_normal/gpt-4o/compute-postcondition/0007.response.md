The variable `b` is assigned the value `'0'`. Since `b` was previously an empty string (which evaluates to false), it is now assigned a definitive value, and the previous condition of `b` being false no longer holds. The state of `data` and `a` remains unchanged, but now `b` has a specific value. 

Output State: **`data` is a list of length 2 containing two non-negative integers as strings, `a` is '0', `b` is '0'**.
