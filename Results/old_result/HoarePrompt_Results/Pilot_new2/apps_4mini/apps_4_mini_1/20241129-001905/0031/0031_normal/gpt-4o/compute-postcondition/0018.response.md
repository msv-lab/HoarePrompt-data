The value of `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`. The value of `numerator` is 0, so `p_no_shared` will also be 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 2^k % 1000003, and `p_no_shared` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 0, `denominator` is 2^k % 1000003, `p_no_shared` is 0**.
