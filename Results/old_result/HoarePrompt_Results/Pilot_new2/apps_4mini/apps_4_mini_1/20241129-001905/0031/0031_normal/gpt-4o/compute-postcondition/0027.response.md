The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, with the constraints that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. The function does not return any value as the return statement is empty. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integers, `n` and `k`, but it does not produce any output or return any value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, both integers, but does not return any value.**
