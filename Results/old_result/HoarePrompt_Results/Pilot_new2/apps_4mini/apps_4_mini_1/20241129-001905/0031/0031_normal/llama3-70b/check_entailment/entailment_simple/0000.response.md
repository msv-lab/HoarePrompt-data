To determine whether the provided program correctly implements the solution according to the problem description, we need to analyze the logic of the code and compare it to the requirements.

### Problem Description Recap:
1. **Input:** Two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` defines the number of days as `2^n` and `k` is the number of people.
2. **Output:** The probability that at least two people share the same birthday expressed as an irreducible fraction A/B, where A and B must be coprime.
3. **Constraints:** Results should be returned modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

### Program Logic Analysis:
1. **Calculating Total Days:** `total_days = 2 ** n` correctly calculates the number of days in Udayland.
2. **Numerator Calculation:** The numerator is computed using:
   \[
   \text{numerator} = (2^n) \times (2^n - 1) \times (2^n - 2) \times \ldots \times (2^n - (k - 1))
   \]
   This represents the number of ways to assign different birthdays to `k` people if there are `2^n` days.
3. **Denominator Calculation:** The denominator is simply:
   \[
   \text{denominator} = (2^n)^k
   \]
   This represents the total possible birthday assignments for `k` people (where each person can be born on any of the `2^n` days).
4. **GCD Reduction:** The program computes the GCD of the numerator and denominator and reduces them, which ensures that the fraction is in its irreducible form.
5. **Modulo Operation:** The results are returned modulo \(10^6 + 3\), which is necessary as the final result must be within the specified range.

### Correctness Check:
- The program correctly handles the case where `k` exceeds `2^n`, in which case the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is 1 (i.e., A = 1, B = 1).
- It correctly computes the probabilities in the general case when `k` is less than or equal to `2^n`.
- The calculations involving the GCD ensure that the outputs meet the requirement that A and B are coprime.

### Conclusion:
The program adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description. It correctly calculates the required probability, reduces the fraction properly, and outputs the results in the required format.

Thus, the final verdict is:

Correctness: **True**
