To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic and potential edge cases.

### Analyzing the Program

1. **Input Constraints**: The function takes two integers `n` and `k`, where:
   - `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`
   - `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`
   These constraints imply that the birthday calculation must handle very large numbers, specifically `2^n` can reach around `10^18`.

2. **Immediate Condition**: The program checks if `k > 2^n`. If this condition holds true, it immediately returns `1, 1`, which is correct because with more people than days, there will definitely be shared birthdays.

3. **Calculating Probabilities**:
   - It calculates the total number of days as `total_days = 1 << n`, which represents `2^n`.
   - It then calculates the probability of no two people sharing a birthday by computing the numerator and denominator iteratively for each person, which looks correct up to this point.

4. **Final Steps**:
   - The program computes the probability of shared birthdays, simplifies it to an irreducible fraction, and prints the results modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Potential Edge Cases:
- Consider the case when `n = 1` and `k = 2`. The total number of days is `2^1 = 2`. This means, if we have 2 people, they will definitely share a birthday. The expected output should be `1 1` which the program handles correctly.
- Now extend the edge case to `n = 1` and `k = 3`. Here, the total number of days is still `2`, but now with `3` people, there must be shared birthdays. The expected output is again `1 1`, which is handled correctly by the program as well.
- For larger values of `n`, such as `n = 3` and `k = 2`, we have `2^3 = 8`, and the calculated output is `1 8`, which aligns with the expected output.

### Finding a Failing Case
However, a critical edge case appears with large values of `n` and `k`. For instance, if `n = 1000000000000000000` and `k=3`, the operation `1 << n` will be too large to handle in Python, leading to potential performance or overflow issues despite Python's integer handling capability.

### Conclusion
- The program correctly calculates the probabilities and produces the expected results for the provided examples and potential edge cases. However, there are scenarios, especially with large `n`, where the calculations involving `1 << n` can become problematic, and might not be handled efficiently or correctly.

Thus, based on potential cases and given the constraints:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not handle large values of `n` efficiently and could run into performance issues or overflow errors in practical scenarios.
