The function accepts two integers, `n` and `k`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. It calculates probabilities related to the distribution of `k` items over `2^n` total days modulo `1000003`. If `k` is greater than `2^n`, it prints (1, 1) and returns without performing further calculations. Otherwise, it computes the number of ways to choose `k` items from `2^n` total items, normalizes this fraction, and prints the resulting values modulo `1000003`. The function does not return any value.
