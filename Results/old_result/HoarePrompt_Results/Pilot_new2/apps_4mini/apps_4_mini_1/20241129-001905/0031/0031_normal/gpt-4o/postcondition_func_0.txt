The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b`. The function correctly computes the GCD using the Euclidean algorithm, and it handles cases where either `a` or `b` could be zero, as the loop will execute at least once if `b` is not initially zero. If both `a` and `b` are zero, the GCD is conventionally defined to be zero, but the function does not explicitly account for this scenario.
