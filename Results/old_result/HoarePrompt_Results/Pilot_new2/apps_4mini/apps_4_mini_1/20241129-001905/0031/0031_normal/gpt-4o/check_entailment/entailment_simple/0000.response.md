To verify the correctness of the given Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. We need to calculate the probability that at least two out of `k` people share a birthday in a year with `2^n` days.
2. The result should be presented as an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \) where \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime.
3. If \( k > 2^n \), then it's guaranteed that at least two people share a birthday, and the output should be \( 1 1 \).
4. The output \( A \) and \( B \) must be given modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Program Analysis:
1. **Function `func_1(a, b)`**: This function correctly computes the GCD of two numbers, which is essential for reducing the fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \).

2. **Function `func_2(n, k)`**:
   - The program starts by checking if \( k > 2^n \). If true, it prints \( 1, 1 \) as expected.
   - Next, the program calculates the total number of days as \( total\_days = 1 << n \) (which is equivalent to \( 2^n \)).
   - It initializes `numerator` and `denominator` to compute the probability:
     - In the loop, it computes the number of ways to choose birthdays for `k` people without any shared birthdays, resulting in a numerator.
     - The denominator is simply the total number of outcomes for `k` people, which is \( total\_days^k \).
   - The probability of at least one shared birthday is then calculated by subtracting the probability of no shared birthday from the total outcomes.

3. Lastly, it reduces the fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \) using GCD, ensuring that \( A \) and \( B \) are coprime, and prints them modulo \( 10^6 + 3 \).

### Edge Cases and Potential Issues:
- The program correctly handles the case where \( k > 2^n \) by outputting \( 1, 1 \).

- The loop for calculating the numerator and denominator runs for `k` iterations, which is feasible given that \( k \) can be large. However, Python's integer handling manages large numbers, but care must be taken for performance due to the potential size of \( k \).

- The final output of \( A \) and \( B \) is reduced, ensuring they are coprime, and the modulo operation is applied at the right stages.

### Conclusion:
From the analysis, the program adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description. It calculates probabilities correctly, handles edge cases, and produces output in the required format.

Thus, the result of the analysis is:

Correctness: **True**
