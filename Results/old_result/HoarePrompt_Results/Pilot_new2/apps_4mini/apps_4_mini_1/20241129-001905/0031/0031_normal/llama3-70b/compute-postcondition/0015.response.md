The value of `denominator` is updated by performing an integer division with `gcd`. The previous values of `denominator` and `gcd` are as follows:

- `denominator` is equal to \(2^{nk}\)
- `gcd` is equal to \(2^{\text{min}(n, nk)}\)

After executing the code `denominator //= gcd`, we have:

- The new value of `denominator` becomes \( \frac{2^{nk}}{2^{\text{min}(n, nk)}} = 2^{nk - \text{min}(n, nk)} \).

The states of the other variables remain unaffected, so the output state is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\); `numerator` is equal to \(\frac{2^n \times (2^n - 1) \times (2^n - 2) \times \ldots \times (2^n - (k - 1))}{2^{\text{min}(n, nk)}}\); `denominator` is equal to \(2^{nk - \text{min}(n, nk)}\); `gcd` is equal to \(2^{\text{min}(n, nk)}\)**.
