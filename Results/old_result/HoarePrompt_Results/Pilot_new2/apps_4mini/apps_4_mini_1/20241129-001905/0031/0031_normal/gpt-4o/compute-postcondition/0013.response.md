The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it by `total_days` and then taking the result modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `denominator` is 2, `total_days` is 2, and `MOD` is 1000003. 

Performing the calculation:
```
denominator = (2 * 2) % 1000003
denominator = 4 % 1000003
denominator = 4
```

No other variables are affected by this code snippet.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 4, `i` is 1**
