Correctness: **False**

The provided program fails to account for the requirements outlined in the problem description regarding how the triangle sides can be modified while ensuring that all sides remain positive integers and form a valid non-degenerate triangle.

For example, if we consider the input:

```
6 3
```

The expected output is `4` because Memory needs to perform the following steps to reduce the triangle from side length 6 to 3:
1. (6, 6, 6) → (6, 6, 3)
2. (6, 6, 3) → (6, 5, 3)
3. (6, 5, 3) → (5, 5, 3)
4. (5, 5, 3) → (3, 3, 3)

This takes 4 seconds, but the program simply calculates `abs(6 - 3)`, which yields `3`. This is incorrect because it overlooks the necessary steps and the fact that the changes must preserve the triangle's validity as a non-degenerate triangle.

Thus, the calculation of `abs(x - y)` does not properly reflect the minimum number of seconds required for the transformation, making the program incorrect.
