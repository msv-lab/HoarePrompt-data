The function `func` does not accept any parameters, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, it operates under the constraint that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100000\). The function's output has not been specified in the provided information. Therefore, without additional output details, the functionality of the function cannot be fully defined.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters and operates under the constraints that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000. The specific output of the function is not provided.**
