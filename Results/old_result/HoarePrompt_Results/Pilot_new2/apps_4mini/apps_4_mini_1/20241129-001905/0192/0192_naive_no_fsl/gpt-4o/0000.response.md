To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it against the problem description and examples.

The problem states that Memory wants to convert an equilateral triangle with side length \( x \) into one with side length \( y \). The requirements are:
1. The triangle must remain a non-degenerate triangle at all times.
2. The sides must be integers.
3. We want to find the minimum number of seconds (or operations) required for this transformation.

The program computes the number of operations using the formula:
```python
(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2
```

This formula effectively calculates the number of operations needed based on the difference between \( x \) and \( y \). Here's how it works:
- \( (x - y) // 2 \) counts how many pairs of sides can be reduced in one operation, effectively halving the difference.
- \( (x - y) \% 2 \) accounts for any remaining side that may need an additional operation if the difference is odd.

### Testing the Logic:
Now, we need to check whether this logic correctly implements the requirements of the problem. 

1. In the case where \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 3 \):
   - Difference \( d = 6 - 3 = 3 \)
   - According to the formula: \( 3 // 2 + 3 \% 2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
   - However, to actually transform (6, 6, 6) to (3, 3, 3), it requires 4 operations as shown in the problem description. The program gives the wrong count.

2. In the case where \( x = 8 \) and \( y = 5 \):
   - Difference \( d = 8 - 5 = 3 \)
   - According to the formula: \( 3 // 2 + 3 \% 2 = 1 + 1 = 2 \)
   - Again, the actual transformation requires 3 operations as shown in the problem description. The program gives the wrong count.

3. For the case where \( x = 22 \) and \( y = 4 \):
   - Difference \( d = 22 - 4 = 18 \)
   - According to the formula: \( 18 // 2 + 18 \% 2 = 9 + 0 = 9 \)
   - However, based on the problem description, the transformation requires 6 operations, that means the program gives the wrong output.

### Conclusion:
The program fails to correctly count the minimum number of operations in multiple cases, as demonstrated with specific examples. 

Thus, the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**
