The code executes a print statement that outputs the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given the initial state, where `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, we can determine the result of `abs(x - y)`.

Since `x` is greater than `y`, the expression simplifies to `x - y`. The exact values of `x` and `y` are not provided, but we know that `x` is at least 4 (since `y` is at most 3) and can go up to 100,000. Therefore, `x - y` will always yield a positive integer.

The states of the other variables are not affected; only the output from the print statement is relevant.

Output State: **`3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000; abs(x - y)` is equal to `x - y`, which is a positive value**.
