The code snippet provided executes a print statement, which does not alter any variables or their values. The values of all pre-existing variables remain intact. Therefore, the output state includes all the valid pre-conditions without any changes. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `seen` is a set containing 0 and possibly 1, `remainder` is equal to `n % 3, and 'No' is printed.**
