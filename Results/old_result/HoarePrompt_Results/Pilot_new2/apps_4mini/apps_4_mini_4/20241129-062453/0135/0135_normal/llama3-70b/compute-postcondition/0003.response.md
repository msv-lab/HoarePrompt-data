The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`. The value of `i` is 1, so `remainder` will be equal to `n % 1`, which is always 0 regardless of the value of `n`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, `seen` is an empty set, `remainder` is 0.**
