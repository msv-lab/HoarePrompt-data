The code snippet executes a `print` statement to output the string 'No'. This action does not affect any variables or their values. Therefore, the output state retains all the previous values of the variables without any changes.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `seen` is a set containing 0, `remainder` is equal to `n % 2, and the output is 'No'.**
