According to the code, the loop is governed by the variable `k`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is greater than or equal to 2, which means that for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented by 1. Therefore, `i` will become 3. 

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`. Since `k` is at least 2, for the loop to continue, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` must be greater than or equal to 3, `i` is 3, `seen` is a set containing 0 and possibly 1, and `remainder` is equal to `n % 2.**
