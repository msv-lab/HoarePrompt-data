Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18 and k ≥ 2, `seen_remainders` contains `remainder`, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is calculated as `n % 2`, which is 0. If `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no output and the program continues execution.***
