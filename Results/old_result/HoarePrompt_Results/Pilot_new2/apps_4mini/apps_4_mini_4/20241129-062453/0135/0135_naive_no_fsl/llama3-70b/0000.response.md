Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when \( k > n \). 

For instance, consider the input \( n = 5 \) and \( k = 6 \). The remainders calculated would be:
- \( 5 \mod 1 = 0 \)
- \( 5 \mod 2 = 1 \)
- \( 5 \mod 3 = 2 \)
- \( 5 \mod 4 = 1 \) (duplicate)
- \( 5 \mod 5 = 0 \) (duplicate)
- \( 5 \mod 6 = 5 \)

Here, the remainders \( 1 \) and \( 0 \) repeat, which should lead to a "No" output. The program will detect the duplicates correctly in this case. 

However, the logic is flawed in the general case where \( k \) exceeds \( n \) and results in incorrectly concluding that all remainders are distinct without further checks. 

Thus, the program fails to provide correct output for cases where \( k \) is greater than \( n \) or for certain specific inputs that lead to duplicates. Therefore, it does not meet the problem requirements for all potential cases.
