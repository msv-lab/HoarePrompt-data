To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the provided code and the output hints.

### Problem Description Analysis

The problem states that we need to check if the remainders of dividing a number `n` by all integers `i` from 1 to `k` are distinct. Specifically, we want to ensure that for any pair `(i, j)` such that `1 ≤ i < j ≤ k`, the condition `n % i != n % j` holds.

### Program Analysis

The code performs the following steps:
1. It checks if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If it is, the function immediately returns 'No'.
2. It initializes an empty set to keep track of the seen remainders.
3. It then loops through all integers from 1 to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by each integer.
4. It checks if the calculated remainder has already been seen:
   - If it has, it returns 'No'.
   - If it hasn’t, it adds the remainder to the set.
5. If all remainders are unique, it returns 'Yes'.

### Edge Cases Consideration
1. **When `k >= n`:** The logic states that if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it will return 'No'. This is because `n % n` is 0, which would duplicate the remainder for `i = n` and another integer less than `n`.
  
2. **When `k` is small relative to `n`:** For example:
   - If `n = 5` and `k = 3`, the remainders will be:
     - `n % 1 = 0`
     - `n % 2 = 1`
     - `n % 3 = 2`
     - Since all are distinct, the output is 'Yes'.
   - If `n = 6` and `k = 3`:
     - `n % 1 = 0`
     - `n % 2 = 0`
     - `n % 3 = 0`
     - Here, the output will be 'No' as there are duplicate remainders.

3. **Remainders for small values of `k`:** If `k` is smaller than `n`, the program correctly computes the distinct remainders.

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints state that:
- The function returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`.
- It calculates the unique remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k` and returns 'No' if any remainder is duplicated, otherwise 'Yes'.

Upon reviewing the output hints, they are consistent with the provided code logic. The hints correctly describe the behavior of the program and the checks it performs.

### Conclusion
The code appears to handle the problem description correctly and considers necessary edge cases. The checks for distinctness of remainders and the immediate return on `k >= n` align with the requirements stated in the description.

Correctness: **True**.
