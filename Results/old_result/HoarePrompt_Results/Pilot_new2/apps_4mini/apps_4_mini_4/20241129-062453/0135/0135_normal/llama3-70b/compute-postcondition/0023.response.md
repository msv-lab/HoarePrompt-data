The function `func` does not accept any parameters. According to the constraints provided, the function deals with two integers, `n` and `k`, which are specified to satisfy the conditions 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. However, as the function itself does not take any inputs, it must rely on some external means to access these values. The output or behavior of the function based on `n` and `k` is unspecified in the provided information.

Therefore, without additional details on the output based on the values of `n` and `k`, I cannot determine specific return values or cases.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and does not have specified return values based on the inputs n and k.**
