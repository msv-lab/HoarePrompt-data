Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `k` are integers assigned based on input values. `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and `n·m·k`, with `a` ≠ `b`. The values of `a_floor` and `b_floor` are determined by the formulas `(a - 1) % m + 1` and `(b - 1) % m + 1`, respectively, and the values of `a_block` and `b_block` are calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1` and `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. Otherwise, if `a_floor` is not greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. In both cases, `min_block_time` is defined as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`.***
