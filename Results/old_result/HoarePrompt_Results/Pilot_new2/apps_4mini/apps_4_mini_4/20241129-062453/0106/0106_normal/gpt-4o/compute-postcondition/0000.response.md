The value of `block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The specific values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are not provided in the initial state, but we know that `m` and `k` are integers within the range of 1 to 1000. This code updates the `block` variable based on the value of `apartment` in relation to the product of `m` and `k`. The other variables (`n`, `a`, and `b`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n·m·k`; `block` is equal to `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
