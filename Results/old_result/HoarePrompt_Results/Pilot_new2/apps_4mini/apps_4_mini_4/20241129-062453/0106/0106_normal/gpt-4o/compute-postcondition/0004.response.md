The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. `apartment` is an integer that represents an apartment number, which is distinct and falls within the range defined by the product of integers `n`, `m`, and `k`. After executing the function body, the function returns two values: `block` and `floor`. The `block` is determined based on the apartment number, and the `floor` is derived from a calculation involving `floor_within_block`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding `block` and `floor` based on the apartment number's positioning within the defined structure.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter apartment, and returns the corresponding block and floor based on the apartment number.**
