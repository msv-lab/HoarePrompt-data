The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters in its definition. However, it operates within the constraints that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; and `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b. 

The output of the function is not provided, so we cannot specify the return values or different cases based on the parameters. Therefore, we cannot determine the functionality of the function at this time.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and the output is not defined based on the provided information.**
