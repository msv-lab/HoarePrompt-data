The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned new values based on the input received from the user. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are unknown, but they will now take on the values specified in the input. The other variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged and their states are still valid. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned new integer values based on input; `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b.**
