Output State: **The program returns the total time which is calculated as the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor, where time_to_exit is either 0 or 9 + floor_a, min_walk_time is the minimum of direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor is equal to (floor_b - 1) * 5.**
