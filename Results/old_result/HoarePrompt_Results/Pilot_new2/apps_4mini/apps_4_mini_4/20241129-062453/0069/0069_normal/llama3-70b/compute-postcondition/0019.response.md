The value of `balance` is assigned the value of `cnt0 - cnt1`. The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are unchanged, but `balance` is now specifically equal to the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`T` is between 1 and 100, `n` is an input integer, `s` is an input binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, `_` is equal to `T`, `x` is an input integer**
