The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is not specified, so we indicate that it has increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is equal to `n + 10`, `n` is equal to `int(data[n + 7])`, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 8])`, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 3 elements, `s` produces a non-empty `prefix_balances`, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `b` is the third element in `prefix_balances`, `count` is increased by 1.**
