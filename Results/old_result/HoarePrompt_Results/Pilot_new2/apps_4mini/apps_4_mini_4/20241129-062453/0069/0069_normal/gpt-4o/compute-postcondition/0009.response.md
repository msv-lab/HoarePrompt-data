The value of `index` is increased by 3. The initial value of `index` is 1, so after this operation, `index` will be 4. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` must be greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 4, `n` is equal to `int(data[1])`, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings derived from the input, `results` is an empty list.
