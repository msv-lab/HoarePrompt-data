Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `index` is equal to `n + 7`, `n` is at least 1, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 5])`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative balance up to index `i` based on the string `s`, the current value of `balance` is 0. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `-1` has been appended to `results`. Otherwise, `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, and `results` is updated to include a new entry of 0.***
