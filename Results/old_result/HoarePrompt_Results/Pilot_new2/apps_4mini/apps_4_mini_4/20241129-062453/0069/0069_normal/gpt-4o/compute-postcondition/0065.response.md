Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `index` is equal to `n + 7`, `n` is at least 1, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 5])`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, and if `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is set to 1.***
