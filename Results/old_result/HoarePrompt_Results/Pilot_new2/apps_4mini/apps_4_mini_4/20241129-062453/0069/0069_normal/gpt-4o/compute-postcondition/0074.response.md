Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 0, `index` is equal to `n + 7`, `n` is at least 1, `n + 7` is less than the length of `data`, `x` is equal to `int(data[n + 5])`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative balance up to index `i` based on the string `s`. If `balance` is equal to 0, `-1` is appended to `results` if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, otherwise, a new entry of 0 is added to `results`. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is equal to the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, with `results` being updated to include the new value of `count`.***
