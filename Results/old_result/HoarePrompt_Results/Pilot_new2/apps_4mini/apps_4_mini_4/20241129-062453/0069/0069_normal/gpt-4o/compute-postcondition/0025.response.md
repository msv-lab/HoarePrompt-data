Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is equal to `int(data[2])`, `s` is equal to `data[3]`, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the cumulative balance up to index `i`, which reflects the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in the substring `s[0:i]`.***
