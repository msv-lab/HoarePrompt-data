The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' (depublicans) and 'R' (remocrats). It processes the votes in a competitive manner, simulating matchups between indices of 'D' and 'R'. If 'D' indices are exhausted before 'R', it prints 'R'; if 'R' indices are exhausted before 'D', it prints 'D'. The function does not handle cases where both 'D' and 'R' are absent, as it assumes the input will always contain at least one of each.
