According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `fractions` list. If `fractions` has remaining characters after `fraction`, the loop will execute once more. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), and `fractions` has remaining characters after `fraction`. 

Assuming `fraction` is a character from the `fractions` list, if `fractions` still has remaining characters, the next `fraction` will be the next character in the list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `fractions` must have at least one character remaining after the current `fraction`.

The `depublicans` and `remocrats` would be updated based on the value of the next `fraction`. However, since we do not have the exact values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` at the end of the last iteration, we only need to ensure that they are updated accordingly based on the next character in `fractions`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` has at least one remaining character, `depublicans` and `remocrats` will be updated accordingly based on the next character in `fractions`**
