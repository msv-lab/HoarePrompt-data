Correctness: **False**.

The provided program simply counts the number of employees from each fraction (depublicans and remocrats) and determines the winner based on which count is higher. However, the problem description specifies a more complex voting and denial process that is not captured by just counting the employees.

For example, consider the input:
```
5
DRDRD
```
In this scenario, the voting process can lead to the remocrats winning. If the first employee (D) denies the second employee (R), the next (R) can deny the fourth (R), and so on. The order of denials is crucial, and the situation is dynamic, not static as the program assumes.

Thus, the program fails to account for the optimal strategies of the employees when denying votes, which could lead to different outcomes than simply counting fractions. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem.
