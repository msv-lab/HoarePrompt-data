Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` is updated to include `d_index + n` as its last element. Otherwise, `r_queue` is updated to include `r_index + n` as its last element. In both cases, `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue` and removed from it, and `r_index` is set to the first element that was in `r_queue` before it was popped.***
