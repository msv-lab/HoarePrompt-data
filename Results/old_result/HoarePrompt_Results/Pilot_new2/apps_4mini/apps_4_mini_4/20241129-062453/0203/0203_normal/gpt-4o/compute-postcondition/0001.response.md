`votes` is assigned the value of `input().strip()`, which reads a line of input and removes any leading or trailing whitespace. The initial state of `n` (positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and the string consisting of 'D' and 'R' remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' with length equal to `n` after stripping any whitespace.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' with length equal to `n` after stripping any whitespace.**
