The program does not correctly implement the voting procedure described in the problem statement. 

### Explanation of Incorrectness:

1. **Simplification of Voting Process**: The program simply counts the number of 'D' (depublicans) and 'R' (remocrats) characters in the input string and compares these counts to determine the winner. This simplification ignores the complex voting procedure outlined in the problem description.

2. **Ignoring the Voting Mechanism**: According to the problem, employees deny others from voting based on their optimal behavior, and the process can repeat until only one employee remains. The program fails to account for how employees can declare others ineligible to vote during their turn, which is a critical part of the voting mechanism. The program does not simulate this dynamic interaction.

3. **Outcome Based on Pure Counts**: The program only checks if the count of depublicans is greater than the count of remocrats to declare a winner. This does not reflect the actual voting process where the order of statements and the denial of voting rights could significantly change the outcome.

### Example of Incorrectness:
Consider the input:
```
5
DDRRR
```
The expected outcome according to the problem description is 'D', but the program would output 'D' because there are more 'D's than 'R's. However, in a scenario where remocrats can optimally deny depublicans from voting based on their statements, the result might differ.

Given these points, the program does not align with the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
