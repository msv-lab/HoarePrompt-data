The code initializes `d_queue` as an empty list. The variable `n` remains unchanged, being a positive integer within the specified range, and `votes` also remains unchanged as a string made up of 'D' and 'R' characters. Therefore, the Output State reflects the unchanged variables along with the newly initialized empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string consisting of characters 'D' and 'R' with length equal to `n`; `d_queue` is an empty list.**
