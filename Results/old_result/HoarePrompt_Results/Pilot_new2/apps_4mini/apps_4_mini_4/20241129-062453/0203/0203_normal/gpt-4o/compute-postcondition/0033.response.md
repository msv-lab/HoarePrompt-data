According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the non-emptiness of both `d_queue` and `r_queue`. The conditions are as follows:

1. `d_queue` must not be empty.
2. `r_queue` must not be empty.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that:
- `d_queue` is not empty (necessary for the loop to execute).
- `r_queue` is not empty (necessary for the loop to execute).

Thus, the current states regarding `d_index` and `r_index` do not require adjustments as they already fulfil their respective conditions to ensure that the loop will execute again. 

No adjustments are necessary to ensure both queues remain non-empty for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; `d_index` is less than `r_index` implies `r_queue` must contain at least 2 elements and `d_queue` has a new element which is `d_index + n`; or `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index` implies `d_queue` is not empty and `r_queue` has the new value `r_index + n`, while `r_queue` has one less element.**
