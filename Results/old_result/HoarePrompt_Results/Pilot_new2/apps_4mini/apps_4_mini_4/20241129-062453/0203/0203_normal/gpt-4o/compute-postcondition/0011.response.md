The code `d_queue.append(i)` appends the current value of `i` to the list `d_queue`. Since `i` is equal to `n`, the value being appended is `n`. The variable `d_queue` now includes the value of `n` at the end of the list, but the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `i` is `n`, `v` is the next character in the votes string at index `n`, `d_queue` now includes `n`, `r_queue` is the corresponding state based on `v`.**
