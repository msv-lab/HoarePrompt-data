Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string `fractions` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string and prints 'D' if there are more 'D's than 'R's; otherwise, it prints 'R'. The function does not handle cases where `n` is 0 or where the input does not strictly consist of 'D' and 'R' characters, which could lead to incorrect behavior.**
