The value of `depublicans` is incremented by 1. The current state indicates that `depublicans` was initially 0, so after executing the code, `depublicans` will be 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a non-empty string, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0, and `fraction` is 'D'.**
