Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000), `fractions` is a string of length `n`, `depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D'. The count of 'D' characters (`depublicans`) is less than or equal to the count of characters that are not 'D' (`remocrats`).***
