The code appends `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. Since `r_queue` initially has one less element, appending this value will increase its length by one. The values of `d_queue` and `d_index` remain unchanged, and the constraints on `n`, `votes`, and `d_index`, `r_index` also remain valid.

Given that:
- `r_index` is the value of the first element of the original `r_queue`
- `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000

The new value appended to `r_queue` would be equal to `r_index + n`.

Thus, the output state captures that `r_queue` now includes an additional element, which is the sum of `r_index` and `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; `d_queue` is now empty; `r_queue` has one more element equal to `r_index + n`; `d_index` is the value of the first element of the original `d_queue`; `r_index` is the value of the first element of the original `r_queue`; `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`.**
