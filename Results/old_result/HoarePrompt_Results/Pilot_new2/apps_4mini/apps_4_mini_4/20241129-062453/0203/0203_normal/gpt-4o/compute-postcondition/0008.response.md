The code appends the value of `i` (which is 0) to the `r_queue`. Since `r_queue` is initially an empty list, after the code executes, it will contain the value 0. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of 'D' and 'R'; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is [0]; `i` is 0; `v` is 'R'**.
