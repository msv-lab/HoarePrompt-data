The code appends `r_index + n` to the `r_queue`. Given that `r_index` is the value of the previous first element of `r_queue`, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, the new value added to `r_queue` will be `r_index + n`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `r_queue` must contain at least 2 elements; if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `d_queue` is not empty; `d_index` is the value of the first element of `d_queue`; `r_index` is the value of the previous first element of `r_queue`; `r_queue` has one less element; `r_queue` now contains the new value `r_index + n`.**
