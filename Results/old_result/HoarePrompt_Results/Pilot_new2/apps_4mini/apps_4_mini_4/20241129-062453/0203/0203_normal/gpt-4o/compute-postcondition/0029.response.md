The value of `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue`, which is removed from `r_queue`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; if `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `r_queue` must contain at least 2 elements; if `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `d_queue` is not empty; `d_index` is the value of the first element of `d_queue`, and `r_index` is now equal to the first element of the previous `r_queue`; `r_queue` has one less element.
