The `r_index` is assigned the value of the first element of `r_queue`, and since `r_queue` must not be empty, this operation will successfully remove that first element from `r_queue`. The `d_queue` remains empty and `d_index` still holds the value of the first element of the original `d_queue`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` must contain at least one 'D' and one 'R'; `d_queue` is now empty; `r_queue` has one less element; `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element of the original `d_queue`; `r_index` is the value of the first element of the original `r_queue`.**
