Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and `a[2]`, and `x` is the next element in the `assigned` list. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
