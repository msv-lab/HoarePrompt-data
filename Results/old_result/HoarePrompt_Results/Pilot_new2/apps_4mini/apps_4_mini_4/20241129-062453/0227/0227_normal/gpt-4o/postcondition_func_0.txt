The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers. It sorts the list and counts how many integers in the list cannot be formed as the difference of any two integers in the list. The function returns this count, which represents the number of distinct integers that could not be formed by pairs in the list.
