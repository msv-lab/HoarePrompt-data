The code snippet assigns the value `False` to the variable `can_form`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers; `assigned` is a set containing the value `a[0]`; `m` is 1; `i` is 1; `can_form` is False.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1; `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers; `assigned` is a set containing the value `a[0]`; `m` is 1; `i` is 1; `can_form` is False.**
