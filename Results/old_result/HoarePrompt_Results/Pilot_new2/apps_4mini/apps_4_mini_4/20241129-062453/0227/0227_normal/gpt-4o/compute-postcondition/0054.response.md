Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, and `assigned` includes at least `a[1]` and `a[2]`. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues without any change to the state.***
