To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the function `func_1` against the requirements stated in the problem description.

The program is designed to convert an integer score between 0 and 99 into its English word representation. Let's break down the possible scenarios:

1. **Single Digit Numbers (0-9)**:
   - The program correctly maps these to their respective words using the `ones` list.

2. **Teen Numbers (11-19)**:
   - The program uses the `teens` list but has a slight issue. Specifically, the range it checks is `11 <= n <= 19`, which means it does not account for the case of `10`. The number `10` is not represented correctly as it falls through to the next condition and is handled incorrectly.

3. **Tens (20, 30, ..., 90)**:
   - The program correctly handles the tens when the number is a multiple of ten (e.g., `20`, `30`, etc.) using the `tens` list.

4. **Numbers between Tens (21-29, 31-39, etc.)**:
   - The code correctly combines the tens and ones with a hyphen for numbers in this range.

5. **Edge Cases**:
   - The code should ideally cover all numbers from `0` to `99` inclusive. However, as outlined above, it fails to correctly represent the number `10`.

Given the problem description and the issues outlined, we have found at least one potential case where the program does not perform as expected:

- The input `10` should output `ten`, but the function does not handle it correctly due to the way conditions are structured.

Based on this analysis:

Correctness: **False**.
