The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. 

- If `n` is between 0 and 9 inclusive, the function returns the string corresponding to the integer value of `n` from the 'ones' list.
- If `n` is between 11 and 19 inclusive, the function returns the string that corresponds to the value of `n-10` from the 'teens' list.
- If `n` is a multiple of 10 between 10 and 99, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of the integer `n`, as determined by the 'tens' list.
- For all other values of `n` between 0 and 99 that are not covered by the previous cases, the function returns the string representation of the number `n` in the format 'tens[n // 10] + '-' + ones[n % 10]', where 'tens[n // 10]' corresponds to the tens place and 'ones[n % 10]' corresponds to the ones place of the integer `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and return its string representation in English based on its value and the specified conditions. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n (0 ≤ n ≤ 99) and returns its string representation in English based on the value of n: returns 'ones' for 0-9, 'teens' for 11-19, the tens place for multiples of 10 from 10-99, and a combination of tens and ones for other values.**
