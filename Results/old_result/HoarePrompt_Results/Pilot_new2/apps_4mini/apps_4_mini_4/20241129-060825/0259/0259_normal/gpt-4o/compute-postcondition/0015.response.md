The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Since `i` is initially 0, `chosen_route` will be updated to 0 + 1 = 1. The other variables remain unchanged in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]` where the current value of `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]` where the current value of `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`.**
