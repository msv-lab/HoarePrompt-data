The value of `ans` is assigned as `i + 1`. Given that `i` is 1, we have `ans = 1 + 1`, which results in `ans` being 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of the form (s, d), `i` is 1, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, `min_time = (t - s) % d`, and `ans` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 2 tuples of the form (s, d), `i` is 1, `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`, `min_time = (t - s) % d`, and `ans` is 2.**
