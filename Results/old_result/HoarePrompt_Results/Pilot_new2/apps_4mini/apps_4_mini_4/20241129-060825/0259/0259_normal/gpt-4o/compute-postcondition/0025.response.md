The value of `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is initially 1, `chosen_route` becomes 2. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[1]`, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is 2.**
