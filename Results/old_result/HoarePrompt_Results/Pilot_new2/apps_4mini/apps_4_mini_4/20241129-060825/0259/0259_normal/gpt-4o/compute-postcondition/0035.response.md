The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. Given that `i` is equal to 2, the value of `chosen_route` becomes 2 + 1, which is 3. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` is assigned the value `bus_routes[2][0]`, `d_i` is assigned the value `bus_routes[2][1]`, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is 3**.
