The code appends a tuple containing the values `s` and `d` to the list `buses`. Here, `s` is a positive integer (user input) and `d` is also a positive integer (user input). The initial state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `buses` now contains an additional tuple.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `s_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `d_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` is a list containing one additional tuple `(s, d)` where `s` is a positive integer (user input), `d` is a positive integer (user input)**.
