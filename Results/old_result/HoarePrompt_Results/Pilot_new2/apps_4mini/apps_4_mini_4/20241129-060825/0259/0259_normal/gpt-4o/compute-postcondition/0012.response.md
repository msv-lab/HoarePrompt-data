Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `i` is 0, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, and `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[0]`. If `t` is less than or equal to `s_i`, then `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. Otherwise, if `s_i` is less than `t`, if `(t - s_i)` is a multiple of `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0; otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
