The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are user inputs, so they are positive integers. The initial state indicates that `buses` is empty, and after the execution of the code, it will contain this new tuple. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `s_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `d_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` is a list containing one tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is a positive integer (user input), `d` is a positive integer (user input)**
