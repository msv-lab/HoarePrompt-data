According to the code, the for loop will execute for each tuple in the `buses` list. Since `n` is between 1 and 100, the `buses` list must contain at least one tuple for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `i` should be initialized to 0, as the loop begins with the first element. Additionally, `s` and `d` will correspond to the values of the first tuple in the `buses` list during the first iteration. 

Thus, for the loop to execute properly:
- `buses` must contain at least 1 tuple.
- `i` starts at 0.
- `s` and `d` will be the first elements of the first tuple in `buses`.

State: **`n` is between 1 and 100, `buses` is a list containing at least 1 tuple of the form (s, d), `i` is 0, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`**
