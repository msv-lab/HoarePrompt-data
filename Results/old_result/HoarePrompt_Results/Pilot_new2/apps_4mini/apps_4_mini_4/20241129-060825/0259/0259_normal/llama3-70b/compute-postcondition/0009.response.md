The values of `s` and `d` are assigned as integers obtained from user input, which are separated by a space. The variable `buses` will have a new tuple `(s, d)` added to it, where `s` is the first positive integer input and `d` is the second positive integer input. The states of the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `s_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `d_i` is a positive integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` is a list containing one additional tuple `(s, d)` where `s` is the first positive integer input and `d` is the second positive integer input.**
