#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list containing two integers followed by N integers, where N is between 2 and 500, and each of the N integers is between 1 and 10^6. The second integer in lst represents K, which is between 0 and 10^9.
def func_1(lst):

    for num in lst[1:]:
        gcd_result = math.gcd(gcd_result, num)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `gcd_result` is the greatest common divisor of all integers in `lst`, `lst` is a list containing at least 2 integers followed by N integers, where N is between 2 and 500.
    return gcd_result
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of all integers in list 'lst', where 'lst' contains at least 2 integers followed by N integers, with N between 2 and 500.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `lst`, where the list contains at least 2 integers followed by up to 498 additional integers (making a total of between 2 and 500 integers). It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of all integers in the list. The function does not validate input length or integer ranges beyond the assumption stated, and it requires the input to contain at least 2 integers for proper execution.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: x is a tuple where x[0] is an integer N (2 <= N <= 500), x[1] is an integer K (0 <= K <= 10^9), and x[2] is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6).

    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #The program returns the sorted list of all divisors of N in descending order.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `x` containing an integer `N`, an integer `K`, and a list of `N` integers `A`. It calculates and returns the sorted list of all divisors of `N` in descending order. Note that the integers `K` and the list `A` are not used in the computation, so their presence does not affect the output.
