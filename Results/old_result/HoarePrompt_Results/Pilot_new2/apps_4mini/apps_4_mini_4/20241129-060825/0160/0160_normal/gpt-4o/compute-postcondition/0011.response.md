The variable `i` is added to the set `divisors`. The value of `i` is determined to be the next value after `i_last` and must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(N))`. Since `divisors` is a set, it will contain unique values, and adding `i` will reflect in the set.

The current state of `x` is unchanged aside from the addition of `i` to `divisors`. Therefore, the output state captures the valid preconditions along with the updated state of `divisors`.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where `x[0]` is N (4 <= N <= 500), `x[1]` is K (0 <= K <= 10^9), `x[2]` is a list of N integers A; `i` is the next value after `i_last` where `i` <= int(math.sqrt(N)); `divisors` includes `i`**.
