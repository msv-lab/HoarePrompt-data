The code `divisors.add(x // i)` adds the result of `x // i` to the set `divisors`. 

Here, `x` is a tuple, and `x[0]` is `N`. The variable `i` is currently `1`. Therefore, `x // i` is equivalent to `N // 1`, which simplifies to `N`. Given that `N` can be any integer between `2` and `500`, the value added to the set `divisors` will be `N`.

Initially, `divisors` contains the value `{1}`. After executing the code, we will have the set `divisors` updated to include `N`.

The other variables' states remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is a tuple where `x[0]` is N (2 <= N <= 500), `x[1]` is K (0 <= K <= 10^9), `x[2]` is a list of N integers A with each A[i] (1 <= A[i] <= 10^6); `divisors` now contains the values {1, N}; `i` is 1; `sqrt(N)` is valid (N >= 2)**.
