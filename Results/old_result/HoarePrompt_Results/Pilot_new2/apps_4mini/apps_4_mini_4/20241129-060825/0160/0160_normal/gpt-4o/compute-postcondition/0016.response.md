The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, which is a tuple consisting of three elements. The first element `x[0]` is an integer `N` that must satisfy the constraint \(2 \leq N \leq 500\). The second element `x[1]` is an integer `K` within the range \(0 \leq K \leq 10^9\). The third element `x[2]` is a list of `N` integers `A`, where each integer `A[i]` must satisfy the constraint \(1 \leq A[i] \leq 10^6\). 

After executing the function body, it returns the sorted list of all divisors of `N` in descending order. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a tuple `x` containing an integer `N`, an integer `K`, and a list of integers `A`, and return the sorted list of all divisors of `N` in descending order.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, which is a tuple containing an integer N, an integer K, and a list of N integers A, and it returns the sorted list of all divisors of N in descending order.**
