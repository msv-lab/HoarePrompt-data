To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the provided information step by step:

1. **Understanding the Loop**: The loop iterates from `i = 1` to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. This means the loop will execute for values of `i` starting from 1 up to the integer value of the square root of `x`, inclusive.

2. **State After Previous Iteration**: The information given states that `x` is a tuple where `x[0]` is `N`, which is between 4 and 500, and `x[1]` is `K`, which is between 0 and \(10^9\). The third component, `x[2]`, is a list of `N` integers. Additionally, if `x` is divisible by 2, the `divisors` include the values 2 and `N // 2`.

3. **Determining the Current Iteration State**: We need to identify the current value of `i` after the last iteration. Since the loop iterates up to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, we denote the maximum value of `i` that has been used in the last iteration as `i_last`.

4. **Calculating the Next Value for `i`**: After the last iteration, to prepare for the next iteration, `i` should be incremented by 1. Hence, `i` for the next iteration will be `i_last + 1`.

5. **Condition for Loop Continuation**: The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(N))`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next value of `i` should be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(N))`.

Given that we need to represent the state at the start of the next iteration, we can summarize as follows:

- The current iteration value must account for the incremented value of `i`.
- We need to ensure the condition for continuation (`i <= int(math.sqrt(N))`) is satisfied.

If we represent the state with respect to the next iteration, assuming `i_last` is the last value of `i` used:

State: **`x` is a tuple where `x[0]` is N (4 <= N <= 500), `x[1]` is K (0 <= K <= 10^9), `x[2]` is a list of N integers A, `i` is the next value after `i_last`, and `i` must be less than or equal to int(math.sqrt(N))**
