`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`. Since the value of `i` is 3 and `max_divisor` must be at least 4 from the precondition, `max_divisor` will remain 4 (as it is the maximum of 4 and 3). The states of the other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`N` is a positive integer, `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9, `A` is a list of integers, `gcd` is at least 4, `i` is 3, and `max_divisor` remains 4.**
