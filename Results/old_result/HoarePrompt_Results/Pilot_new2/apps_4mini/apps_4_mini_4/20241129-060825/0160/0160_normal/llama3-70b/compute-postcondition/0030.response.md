The function `func` accepts three parameters: `N`, `K`, and `A`. 

- `N` is an integer that must be between 2 and 500.
- `K` is a non-negative integer that does not exceed 10^9.
- `A` is a list of `N` integers, where each integer `A_i` is between 1 and 10^6.

The function's output is determined by the values of these parameters, but the specific return value is not provided. Therefore, we can summarize the functionality based on the constraints and relationships of the parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer N (between 2 and 500), a non-negative integer K (not exceeding 10^9), and a list A of N integers (each between 1 and 10^6).**
