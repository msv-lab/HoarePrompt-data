To determine the correctness of the given program, we analyze the logic and identify potential issues based on the problem description.

1. The goal is to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array after performing exactly one swap.

2. The program first identifies the positions of the minimum (1) and maximum (n) elements in the list `a`.

3. It calculates:
   - `max_dist` as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`, which seems to calculate some form of distance reduction.
   - `min_dist` as `min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`, which presumably is to find the minimum distance.

4. Finally, it prints `max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)`.

Here, we need to examine whether the logic actually achieves the goal of maximizing the distance after one swap. 

**Potential Issue:**
- The formula used does not necessarily calculate the maximum possible distance after performing a swap. For example, if 1 is at the start of the array and n is at the end, the current distance is already maximized, and a swap would not change that maximum distance effectively.
- Also, the handling of `n - 2` seems to imply a misunderstanding of the goal, as the maximum distance achievable by a swap does not involve reducing the current distance but instead should be focused on moving the elements to the ends of the array.

### Test Case Consideration
Take the following input:
```
5
1 2 3 4 5
```
In this case, the initial distance between minimum (1) and maximum (5) is `4`. A swap would not yield a distance greater than `4`. The program should return `4`, but will not handle this correctly due to the flawed calculations in `max_dist` and `min_dist`.

Given the above observations, we conclude that the program does not meet the requirements set forth in the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **False**
