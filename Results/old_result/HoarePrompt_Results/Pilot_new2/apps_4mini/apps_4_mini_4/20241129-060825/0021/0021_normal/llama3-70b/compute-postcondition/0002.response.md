The variable `pos1` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of the integer `1` in the list `a`. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers within the range from `1` to `n`, and since `1` is guaranteed to be one of the integers (as it is within the range), `pos1` will hold a valid index.

Since `n` is an integer satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 100\), and `a` contains distinct integers including `1`, we can say that `pos1` will take a value in the range of valid indices of the list `a`, which are from `0` to `n-1`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying \(2 \leq n \leq 100\); `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers within the range 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`.**
