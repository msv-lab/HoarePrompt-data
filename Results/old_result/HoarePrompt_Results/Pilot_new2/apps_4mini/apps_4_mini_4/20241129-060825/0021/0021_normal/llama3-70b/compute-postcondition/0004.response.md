The variable `max_dist` is assigned the value of the maximum between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` minus 1 and `n - 2`. The values of `pos1` and `posn` depend on the positions of the integers `1` and `n` within the list `a`. 

Let:
- `d1 = abs(pos1 - posn) - 1`
- `d2 = n - 2`

Therefore, `max_dist` is calculated as `max(d1, d2)`. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers within the range 1 to `n`; `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of `1` in `a`; `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is equal to `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**.
