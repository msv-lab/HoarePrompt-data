The values of `n` and `k` will be assigned based on the input values, which are integers provided through the `input` function. The `map(int, input().split())` will take a string input, split it into two parts, and convert each part to an integer. The initial constraints on `n` and `k` will remain valid after execution, but their specific values will now be whatever integers were input.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.**
