The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` must not be a multiple of 10, adding 1 to `n` will not change that condition. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is `n + 1` (where `n` is not a multiple of 10), `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8, `x` is equal to 10.

Output State: **`n` is `n + 1` (where `n` is not a multiple of 10), `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8, `x` is equal to 10**
