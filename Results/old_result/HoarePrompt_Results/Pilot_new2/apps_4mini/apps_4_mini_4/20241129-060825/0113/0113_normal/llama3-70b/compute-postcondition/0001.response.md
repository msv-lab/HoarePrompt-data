The variable `x` is assigned the value of `10 ** k`, which means `x` will be equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`. Given that `k` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 8, the possible outcomes for `x` can be calculated as follows: 
- If `k = 0`, then `x = 1`
- If `k = 1`, then `x = 10`
- If `k = 2`, then `x = 100`
- If `k = 3`, then `x = 1000`
- If `k = 4`, then `x = 10000`
- If `k = 5`, then `x = 100000`
- If `k = 6`, then `x = 1000000`
- If `k = 7`, then `x = 10000000`
- If `k = 8`, then `x = 100000000`

The initial values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by the assignment to `x`. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `x` based on the value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `k` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `k` ≤ 8; `x` is equal to `10 ** k`.**
