To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze its logic step by step according to the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Input Specification**:
   - `s`: A string containing a shuffled version of the digits of `n` concatenated with the number of digits in `n`.
   - `t`: A non-empty substring of `n`.

2. **Output Requirement**:
   - The program should output the smallest possible integer `n` that could lead to the input `s` and contains the substring `t`.

### Program Logic Analysis:
1. The program reads the inputs `s` and `t`.
2. It constructs a set `t_set` from string `t`, which is used to check which characters from `s` are in `t`.
3. It initializes an empty string `n` and iteratively appends characters from `s` (that are also in `t_set`) to `n`.
4. Finally, it appends `t` to `n` and converts the result into an integer before printing it.

### Key Observations:
- The program builds `n` by taking characters from `s` that are found in `t`, and then it appends `t` itself.
- However, this logic does not ensure that the constructed integer `n` is the smallest possible value while ensuring that `t` is a contiguous substring of `n`.

### Potential Issue:
Consider the following test case:
- **Input**:
  ```
  s = "3201"
  t = "01"
  ```
- The program would produce `n` as follows:
  - It would find '0' and '1' in `s`, thus constructing `n` as `3210` (since it appends `t` at the end).
- However, the smallest integer `n` that contains the substring `01` is `201` (not `3210`).

### Conclusion:
The logic implemented in the program does not guarantee that the resulting `n` is the smallest integer possible that contains `t` as a substring. There are cases where it fails to provide the correct output.

Correctness: **False**
