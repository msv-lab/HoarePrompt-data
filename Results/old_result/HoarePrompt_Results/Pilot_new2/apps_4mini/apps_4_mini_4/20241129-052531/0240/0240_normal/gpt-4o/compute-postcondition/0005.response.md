According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next permutation of `chars`. Since `perm` represents the current permutation, when the loop runs again, it will yield the next permutation from the `permutations` generator.

At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` was generated from the permutation `perm`. To execute the loop one more time, we simply need to move to the next permutation. Therefore, `chars` remains the same, but `perm` will change to the next permutation.

Since `chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, it will still be a non-empty string. The variable `sub` remains a non-empty string representing a substring and does not need to change. However, we do not have a specific context to adjust `candidate` since it is based on the new `perm`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty string representing a substring, `candidate` will be generated from the next permutation of `chars`**
