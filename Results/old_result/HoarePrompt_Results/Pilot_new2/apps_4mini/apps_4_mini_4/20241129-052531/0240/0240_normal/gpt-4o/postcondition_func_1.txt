The function accepts a string `num_str` containing digits (up to 1,000,000 characters) and a non-empty substring `sub`. It returns True if `sub` is found within `num_str`, but it does not check the length of `num_str` against any variable `n_len` since `n_len` is not defined in the code, which means the function will always return True if `sub` is a substring of `num_str`, regardless of the length of `num_str`.
