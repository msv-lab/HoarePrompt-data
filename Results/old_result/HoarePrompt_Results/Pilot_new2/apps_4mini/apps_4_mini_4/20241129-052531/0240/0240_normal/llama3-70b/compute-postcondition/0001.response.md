The variable `n` is assigned the value of an empty string `''`. The previous states of the other variables (`s`, `t`, `t_set`) remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000; `t` is a non-empty substring of `s` that can contain leading zeroes; `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters from `t`; `n` is an empty string.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000; `t` is a non-empty substring of `s` that can contain leading zeroes; `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters from `t`; `n` is an empty string.**
