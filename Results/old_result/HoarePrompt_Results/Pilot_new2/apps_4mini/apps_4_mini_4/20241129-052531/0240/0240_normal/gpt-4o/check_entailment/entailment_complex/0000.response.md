Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case due to several issues identified in the annotations and the implementation. 

1. **Handling of `n_len`:** The variable `n_len` is calculated but is not properly utilized in the `is_valid_number` function. In this function, the code checks if `sub` is a substring of `num_str` but does not compare `len(num_str)` to `n_len`, leading to incorrect validation of potential numbers. This means `num_str` could have a length different from what it should be, making the output potentially incorrect.

2. **Permutation Generation:** The `generate_possible_numbers` function generates all permutations of `chars`, which is computationally expensive and infeasible for large inputs (up to 1,000,000 characters). Moreover, generating all permutations does not guarantee that the smallest integer `n` will be found, as the code does not prioritize finding the smallest valid number before yielding permutations.

3. **Leading Zeros:** The program does not adequately handle cases where leading zeros may affect the validity of the number `n`. For example, if `s` contains leading zeros or if the result formed by the permutations begins with a zero (excluding the case where `n` is zero), the output could be incorrect. 

4. **Edge Cases:** The program does not handle edge cases correctly. For instance, if `s` is composed of digits that, when combined with `sub`, could lead to an invalid integer representation (like "003512" combined with "021" should yield "30021" but the logic may fail in certain arrangements).

Due to these reasons, there are conditions under which the code does not fulfill the requirements laid out in the problem description, leading to a conclusion of incorrectness.
