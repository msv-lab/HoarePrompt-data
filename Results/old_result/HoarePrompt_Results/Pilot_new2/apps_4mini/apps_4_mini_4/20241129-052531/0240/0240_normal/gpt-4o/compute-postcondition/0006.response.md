The variable `candidate` is assigned the value generated by joining the elements of `perm`, which is generated from the next permutation of `chars`. Since `chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `candidate` will also be a string composed of those digits in a different order, but the specific order isn't provided here. Thus, `candidate` is now a string formed from a permutation of the characters in `chars`. 

The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty string representing a substring, `candidate` is a string generated from the next permutation of `chars`.**
