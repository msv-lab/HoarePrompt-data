`candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which combines the elements in `perm` into a single string. The variables `chars` and `sub` remain unchanged, but the specific value of `candidate` depends on the contents of `perm`, which is not provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty string representing a substring, and `candidate` is equal to the concatenated string of the elements in `perm`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing digits, `sub` is a non-empty string representing a substring, and `candidate` is equal to `''.join(perm)`.**
