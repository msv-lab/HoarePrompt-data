The variable `n` is updated to `n + c`. The character `c` is the third character of the string `s`, which is a non-empty string of digits with at least 3 characters. The value of `c` is a digit character, and the result of the addition depends on whether `c` is in the set `t_set`. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is incremented by the integer value of `c`; otherwise, `n` remains unchanged.

Therefore, the Output State is: 
- If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is updated to `n + int(c)`.
- If `c` is not in `t_set`, then `n` remains the same.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least 3 characters, `c` is the third character of `s`, and `n` is updated to `n + int(c)` if `c` is in `t_set`; otherwise, `n` remains unchanged.**
