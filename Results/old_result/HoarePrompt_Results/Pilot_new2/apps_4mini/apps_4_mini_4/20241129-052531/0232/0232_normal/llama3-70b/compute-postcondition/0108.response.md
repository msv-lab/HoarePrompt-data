`found` is assigned the value `True`. The state of the other variables (`n`, `i`, `j`, and `window_counts[color]`) is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `found` is `True`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `found` is True**
