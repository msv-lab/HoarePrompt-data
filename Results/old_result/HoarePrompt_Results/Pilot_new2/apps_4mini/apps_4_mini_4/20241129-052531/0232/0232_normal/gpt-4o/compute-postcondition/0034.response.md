The value of `left` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `left` was equal to the original value of `n` + 1, so after the increment, `left` will be `original value of n + 2`. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`left` is equal to original value of `n` + 2, `right` is 1, `current_counts` has at least one color less than its corresponding value in `desired_counts`, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1.**
