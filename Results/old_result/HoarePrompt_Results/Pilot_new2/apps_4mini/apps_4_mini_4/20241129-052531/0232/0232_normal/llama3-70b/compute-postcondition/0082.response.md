Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 1, `j` is `n - 1`, `window_counts` contains colors corresponding to the last `n - 1` indices in the `colors` list, with their counts reflecting how many times each color appears in that window. If `found` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
