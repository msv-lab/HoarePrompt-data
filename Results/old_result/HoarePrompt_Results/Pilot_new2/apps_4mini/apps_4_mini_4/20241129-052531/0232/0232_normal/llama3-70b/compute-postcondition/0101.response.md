The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `color` is `colors[3]`, `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or incremented by 1 from its previous value, `found` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
