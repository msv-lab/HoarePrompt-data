The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the most internal loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `i` is 0, `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is now 1, the values of `window_counts` sorted correspond to the values in `counts`, as all counts match their respective targets; `found` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
