`window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The value of `color` is `colors[n - 1]`. Given that `color` was not in `window_counts`, it means it was initially 0. Now, after the execution of the code, `window_counts[color]` will be 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `color` is `colors[n - 1]`, and `window_counts[color]` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is at least 2, `color` is `colors[n - 1]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1**
