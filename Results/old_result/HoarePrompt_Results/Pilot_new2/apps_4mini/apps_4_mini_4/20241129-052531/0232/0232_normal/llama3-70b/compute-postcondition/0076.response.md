The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged, but the variable `found` now indicates that something has been found. The other variables in the initial state are still valid.

Output State: **If `color` is not present in `window_counts`, then `n` is greater than 3, `i` is 1, `j` is 3, `window_counts` contains `color` with a value of 1, where `color` is equal to `colors[3]`, and `found` is True.**
