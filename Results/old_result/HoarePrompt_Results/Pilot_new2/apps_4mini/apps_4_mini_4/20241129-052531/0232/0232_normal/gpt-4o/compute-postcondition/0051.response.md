Postcondition: ***`left` is adjusted to be less than or equal to `n`, `right` is 2, and `current_counts` is modified such that `current_counts[colors[2]]` is incremented by 1 while `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1. If all `current_counts[color]` are equal to `desired_counts[color]` for each color in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES', indicating that the conditions for adjusting colors have been successfully met. If not, the program does not return anything.***
