Postcondition: ***`n` is between 1 and 100, `i` is 2, `j` is `n`, `window_counts` contains counts of colors from `colors[2]` to `colors[n - 1]`, `found` is True, indicating that all counts in `window_counts` match the targets in `counts`. If the loop does not execute, `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, and `found` retains its value of True.***
