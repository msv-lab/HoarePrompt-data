The value of `color` is reassigned to the value of `colors[j]`, where `j` is 3. The previous value of `color` was `colors[n - 1]`, but it is now updated. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State will include the new value of `color` based on `j`.

Output State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `j` is 3, `color` is `colors[3]`, `window_counts[color]` is 1**
