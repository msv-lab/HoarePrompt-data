The values of `n` and `m` are assigned the result of `map(int, input().split())`, which splits the input into two integers. The initial conditions state that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, and `m` is an integer between 1 and `n`. The values of `n` and `m` will now be specific integers based on user input. The lightsaber colors and desired counts are not directly affected by this line of code.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and n, and the values of `n` and `m` are now assigned based on user input.**
