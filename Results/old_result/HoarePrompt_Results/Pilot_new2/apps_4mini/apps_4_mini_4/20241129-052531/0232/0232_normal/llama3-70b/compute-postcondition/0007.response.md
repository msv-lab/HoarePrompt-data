Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `colors` is a list of integers containing at least 1 integer, `color` is the first element in the `colors` list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from user input, and `color_counts` is a dictionary that contains `color` as a key with a value of `0` if `color` was not already present in `color_counts`. Otherwise, `color_counts` remains unchanged.***
