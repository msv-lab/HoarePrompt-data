The value of `color` is assigned the value `colors[j]`, where `j` is currently 4. This means `color` will now be equal to `colors[4]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `color` is equal to `colors[4]`.

Output State: **`n` must be greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `color` is equal to `colors[4]**
