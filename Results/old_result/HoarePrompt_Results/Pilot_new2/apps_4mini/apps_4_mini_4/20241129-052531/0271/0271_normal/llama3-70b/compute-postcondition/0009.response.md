Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer satisfying 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If `n` is divisible by 10, its value is printed to the console. If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, `n` is updated to the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to its previous value. If `n % 10` is greater than 5, the printed result is either `n + 4`, `n + 3`, `n + 2`, or `n + 1`.***
