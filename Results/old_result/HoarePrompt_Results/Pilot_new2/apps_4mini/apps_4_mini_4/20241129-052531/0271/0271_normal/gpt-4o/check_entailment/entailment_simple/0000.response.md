To evaluate the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's dissect how the program operates and compare it with the requirements.

### Problem Description Summary
The task is to round a non-negative integer `n` to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` already ends with 0, it remains unchanged. The possible values for rounding are determined by the last digit (the remainder when divided by 10).

### Rounding Logic
1. If `n` ends with 0 (`remainder = 0`), it should return `n`.
2. If `n` ends with digits 1-5 (`remainder = 1, 2, 3, 4, 5`), it should round down to the nearest multiple of 10 (`n - remainder`).
3. If `n` ends with digits 6-9 (`remainder = 6, 7, 8, 9`), it should round up to the next multiple of 10 (`n + (10 - remainder)`).

### Review of the Program
1. The program reads the input value `n`.
2. It calculates the `remainder` as `n % 10`.
3. It checks if the `remainder` is 5 or less to determine whether to round down or up:
   - If `remainder <= 5`: returns `n - remainder`.
   - If `remainder > 5`: returns `n + (10 - remainder)`.
4. Finally, it prints the result.

### Evaluation of Correctness
- **Case of `n` ending with 0**: The program returns `n` correctly.
- **Case of `n` ending with 1-5**: The program correctly rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10.
- **Case of `n` ending with 6-9**: The program correctly rounds up to the next multiple of 10.

### Conclusion
The program correctly implements the rounding logic as specified in the problem description. Since it handles all cases appropriately and outputs the expected results based on the conditions described, we can conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
