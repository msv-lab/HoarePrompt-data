The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by 10. Since `n` is an input integer in the range from 0 to 10^9, `remainder` will take a value between 0 and 9, inclusive. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is `n % 10`, which is a value between 0 and 9 inclusive.**
