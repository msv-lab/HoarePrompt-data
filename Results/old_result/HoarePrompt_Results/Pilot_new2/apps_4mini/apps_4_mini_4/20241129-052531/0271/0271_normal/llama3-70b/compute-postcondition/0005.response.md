`n` is assigned the value `n - n % 10`, which effectively rounds `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10. Given that `n` is an integer satisfying 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and that `n` is not a multiple of 10 with a remainder less than or equal to 5 when divided by 10, the new value of `n` will be the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to `n`. Therefore, the value of `n` will be reduced to `n - (n % 10)`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer satisfying 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `n` is not a multiple of 10, and the new value of `n` is the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to the previous value of `n`.**
