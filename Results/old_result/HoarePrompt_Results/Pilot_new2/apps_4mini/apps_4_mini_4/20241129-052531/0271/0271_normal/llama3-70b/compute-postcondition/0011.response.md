Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer input from the user and prints it if it is a multiple of 10. If the input is not a multiple of 10, it prints the largest multiple of 10 that is less than or equal to the input if the remainder when divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5. If the remainder is greater than 5, it prints the next higher multiple of 10. The function does not return any value; it only prints to the console. **
