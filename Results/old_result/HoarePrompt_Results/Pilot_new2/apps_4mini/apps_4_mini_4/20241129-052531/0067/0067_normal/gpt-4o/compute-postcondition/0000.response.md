The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are being assigned from the input values, which are integers constrained within the range of 0 to 100. The specific values for `x`, `y`, and `z` will depend on the input provided. Therefore, after executing the assignment statement, the Output State will reflect the new values assigned to `x`, `y`, and `z`, while maintaining the constraint that they are all integers within the specified range.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `x`, `y`, `z` are assigned from input values**.
