To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program can produce the correct outputs under all circumstances defined by the problem.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. If the number of upvotes (`x`) is greater than the combined number of downvotes (`y`) and unknown votes (`z`), the output should be "+".
2. If `x` is less than `y`, the output should be "-".
3. If `x` is equal to `y`, we need to check:
   - If `z` is 0, output "0".
   - If `z` is greater than 0, output "?" (indicating uncertainty).
4. If there are any other scenarios that lead to multiple results, output "?".

### Program Evaluation:
Let's break down the logic of the provided program:

```python
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    if (x > y + z):
        print('+')
    else:
        if (x < y):
            print('-')
        else:
            if (x == y):
                if (z == 0):
                    print('0')
                else:
                    print('?')
            else:
                print('?')
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Condition `if (x > y + z):`**: This correctly checks if upvotes are definitively greater than downvotes (including unknowns). It outputs "+" in this case.
  
2. **Condition `if (x < y):`**: This checks if upvotes are definitively less than downvotes. This correctly outputs "-" and adheres to the requirement.

3. **Condition `if (x == y):`**: This checks if upvotes and downvotes are equal. Inside this block:
   - If `z == 0`, it correctly outputs "0", indicating an equal count with no uncertainty.
   - If `z > 0`, it outputs "?" correctly indicating uncertainty since the unknown voters could tip the balance either way.

4. **The `else:` statement after `if (x == y):`**: This part checks if `x` is not equal to `y`. However, this branch will never execute, as `x` can either be greater than, less than, or equal to `y`. Thus, this `else` is redundant.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the logic as described in the problem statement. It handles all scenarios defined by the problem description, producing the correct outputs for all possible values of `x`, `y`, and `z` within the specified bounds.

Thus, the final correctness evaluation is:

Correctness: **True**
