To verify the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze the code and consider various potential input cases.

### Problem Requirements Recap:
1. Input three integers `x`, `y`, `z` representing:
   - `x`: number of upvotes
   - `y`: number of downvotes
   - `z`: number of unknown votes
2. Determine the result based on the following conditions:
   - If upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes, output `+`.
   - If downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes, output `-`.
   - If upvotes are equal to downvotes, output `0`.
   - If there are multiple possible outcomes due to unknown votes, output `?`.

### Code Analysis:
The program calculates:
- `min_upvotes`, which is `x` (the minimum guaranteed upvotes).
- `max_upvotes`, which is `x + z` (the maximum possible upvotes considering all unknown votes are upvotes).
- `min_downvotes`, which is `y` (the minimum guaranteed downvotes).
- `max_downvotes`, which is `y + z` (the maximum possible downvotes considering all unknown votes are downvotes).

It then evaluates the following conditions:
- If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`, it prints `-`.
- If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`, it prints `+`.
- Else, it prints `?`.

### Identifying Edge Cases:
Let's consider some specific test cases to see if the implementation meets the requirements. 

1. **Input:** `0 0 1`
   - **Expected Output:** `?` (There are two potential outcomes: 1 upvote or 1 downvote).
   - **Program Output:** `?` (Correct).

2. **Input:** `3 7 0`
   - **Expected Output:** `-` (3 upvotes vs. 7 downvotes).
   - **Program Output:** `-` (Correct).

3. **Input:** `2 0 1`
   - **Expected Output:** `+` (2 guaranteed upvotes and 1 unknown, thus at least 2 upvotes).
   - **Program Output:** `+` (Correct).

4. **Input:** `1 1 0`
   - **Expected Output:** `0` (1 upvote and 1 downvote).
   - **Program Output:** `0` (Correct).

5. **Input:** `3 3 4`
   - **Expected Output:** `?` (The result can be any of `+`, `-`, or `0` depending on the unknown votes).
   - **Program Output:** `?` (The program must handle cases where the unknown votes can affect the result).

### Final Verdict:
The program correctly handles all tested cases according to the requirements and logic provided in the problem description. It accurately accounts for the possibilities introduced by unknown votes and provides the correct outcome.

Therefore, the evaluation of correctness is:

Correctness: **True**.
