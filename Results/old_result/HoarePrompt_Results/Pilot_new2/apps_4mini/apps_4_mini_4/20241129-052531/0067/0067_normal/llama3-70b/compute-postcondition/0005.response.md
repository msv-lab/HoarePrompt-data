The code outputs a string `'-'`, but does not change any values of the variables `x`, `y`, or `z`. The initial conditions remain valid after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`; and the current value of `x` is less than `y`.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `x` is less than or equal to `y + z`; and the current value of `x` is less than `y`.**
