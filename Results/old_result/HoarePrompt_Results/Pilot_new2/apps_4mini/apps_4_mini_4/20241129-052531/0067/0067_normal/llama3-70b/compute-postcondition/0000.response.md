The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned based on the input given through `input().split()` after converting those input strings to integers using `map(int, ...)`. Since the initial state allows for `x`, `y`, and `z` to be any non-negative integers within the range 0 to 100, their specific values will be provided by the user during execution. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State reflects that `x`, `y`, and `z` now hold the values from the input, while the initial conditions remain valid.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100; `x`, `y`, `z` are now assigned values based on user input.**
