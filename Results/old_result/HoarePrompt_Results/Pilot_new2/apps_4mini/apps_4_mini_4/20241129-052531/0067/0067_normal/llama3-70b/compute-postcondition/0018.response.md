The function `func` does not accept any parameters. Instead, it operates on three non-negative integers: `x`, `y`, and `z`, where each of these values must satisfy the constraint 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The function does not return any specific output since the output details are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is currently undefined due to the lack of output information. 

Functionality: **The function accepts no parameters and operates on three non-negative integers x, y, and z constrained between 0 and 100, but the return value is not specified.**
