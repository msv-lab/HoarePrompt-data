According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to the value of `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, meaning that `n // 2` will be at least 2 (since `n` can be 4 or more).

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` will be incremented by 1, so it will become 2. At this point, the loop can execute again because `i` (which will be 2) is still less than `n // 2` (which is at least 2 when `n` is 4, but will still allow for further iterations when `n` is greater than 4).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
