#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000.
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000; if the loop executed, `s` is a palindrome, otherwise, it is a non-palindrome string.
    return True
    #The program returns True, indicating that the string 's' is a palindrome.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a string `s` and determines whether it is a palindrome. It returns `True` if `s` reads the same forwards and backwards, and `False` if it does not. Given the constraints, the function handles strings of length between 1 and 1000, and it checks characters in a case-sensitive manner. If `s` has a length of 1, it is always a palindrome and will return `True`.
