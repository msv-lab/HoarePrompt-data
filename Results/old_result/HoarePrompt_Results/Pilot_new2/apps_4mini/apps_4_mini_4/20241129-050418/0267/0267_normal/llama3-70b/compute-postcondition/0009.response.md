The variable `dp` is updated with a new key-value pair where the key is the tuple `(n, k)` and the value is `9`. The initial state specifies that `k` is an integer ranging from `1` to `10` and is not zero, and that the pair `(n, k)` is not present in `dp`, implying that when the assignment is made, it will create this entry in the `dp` dictionary. Other variables such as `l` and `r` remain unchanged since they are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10 and `k` is not equal to 0, `dp[n, k]` is 9.**
