According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the range defined by `l` and `r`. The loop can execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Given the conditions provided where `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, both `l` and `r` are valid integers that satisfy the constraints. 

At the start of the loop, `num` will take on the value of `l`, and it will iterate up to `r`, inclusive. Since the initial value of `total_sum` is 0, it does not affect the loop's ability to execute.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and we can set `num` to `l` at the beginning of the loop. 

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
