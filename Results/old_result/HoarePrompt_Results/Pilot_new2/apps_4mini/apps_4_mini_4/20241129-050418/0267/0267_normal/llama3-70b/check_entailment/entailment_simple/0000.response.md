To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly implements the requirements of calculating the sum of numbers from \(l\) to \(r\) that contain at most \(k\) different digits, and then return this sum modulo \(998244353\).

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Function Structure**: The program defines two functions: `func_1` and `count`.
   - `func_1` takes three integers \(l\), \(r\), and \(k\) and calculates the sum of numbers in the range \([l, r]\) that meet the digit condition.
   - `count` is designed to count the numbers up to \(n\) which contain at most \(k\) different digits.

2. **Functionality of `count`**:
   - The function first checks if \(k = 0\) and returns 0, which is appropriate since no digits can be used.
   - It uses a memoization dictionary `dp` to store previously computed results for given \(n\) and \(k\).
   - If \(n\) is less than \(10^k\), it returns \(n\) as all numbers from 0 to \(n\) can be formed with at most \(k\) digits.
   - When \(n\) is greater than or equal to \(10^k\), it calculates the number of valid combinations of digits and adjusts the count accordingly.

3. **Correctness Check**:
   - The program correctly identifies and sums numbers with at most \(k\) different digits. The use of memoization helps optimize performance for large ranges.
   - The final return statement in `func_1` correctly applies the modulo operation as specified in the problem description.

### Conclusion:

The program implements the necessary logic to compute the sum of numbers from \(l\) to \(r\) that contain at most \(k\) different digits, conforms with the constraints, and uses correct mathematical operations as required.

Thus, we conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**
