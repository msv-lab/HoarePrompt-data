In the given code snippet, `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and then applying the modulus operation with `MOD`. 

1. The initial value of `total_sum` is set to `l % MOD`.
2. The value of `num` is `r + 1`, which is valid as long as `r + 1` is less than or equal to `10^18`.
3. The new value of `total_sum` becomes `(l % MOD + (r + 1)) % MOD`.

Since `total_sum` was initially `l % MOD`, we can express the updated `total_sum` as:

- Let `initial_total_sum = l % MOD`.
- Then, `new_total_sum = (initial_total_sum + (r + 1)) % MOD`.

The values of `l`, `r`, `k`, and `MOD` remain unchanged, and the specific values for `total_sum` and `num` are updated.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10; `total_sum` is `(l % MOD + (r + 1)) % MOD`; `num` is `r + 1` if `r + 1` <= `10^18`.**
