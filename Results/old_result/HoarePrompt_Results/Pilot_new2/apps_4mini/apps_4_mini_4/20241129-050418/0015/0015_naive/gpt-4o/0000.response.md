Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case when `c` is negative properly. Specifically, if `a` is greater than `b` and `c` is negative, the sequence will decrease, and there may be valid instances where `b` could appear in the sequence, but the current logic fails to account for this.

For example:
- Input: `10 5 -2`
  - The sequence would be `10, 8, 6, 4, ...`, which includes `5`. However, the program would output "NO" because it checks `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which evaluates to `-5 / -2 >= 0` (True) but fails to consider that `b` should actually appear in the sequence.

Thus, there exists at least one input case where the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description, leading to the determination of correctness as **False**.
