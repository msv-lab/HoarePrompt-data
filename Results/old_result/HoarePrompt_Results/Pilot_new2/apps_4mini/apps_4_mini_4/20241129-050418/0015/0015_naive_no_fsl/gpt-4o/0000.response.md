Correctness: **False**

The program fails to handle the case where the difference `c` is negative. In such cases, the sequence will decrease instead of increase. The provided code doesn't account for the situation when `b` is less than `a` and `c` is negative. 

For example, consider the input:
```
5 3 -1
```
In this case, the sequence would be `5, 4, 3, 2, 1, ...` and `3` does appear in the sequence, so the output should be "YES". However, the program would incorrectly return "NO" because `(b - a) / c` would evaluate to a negative number, which does not meet the condition of being greater than or equal to zero.

Thus, there are cases where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
