The function `func` accepts three parameters: `a`, `b`, and `c`. All parameters are integers and are within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. The function's output is not specified, so we cannot determine the return value based on the given information. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept three integer parameters `a`, `b`, and `c`, but the output behavior is not provided.
