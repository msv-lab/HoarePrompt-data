The code `print('NO')` outputs the string 'NO' but does not modify any variables. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged. The only effect of the code is the output to the console. 

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers that have been assigned new values based on input provided; the current value of `c` is 0, and `a` is not equal to `b`.**
