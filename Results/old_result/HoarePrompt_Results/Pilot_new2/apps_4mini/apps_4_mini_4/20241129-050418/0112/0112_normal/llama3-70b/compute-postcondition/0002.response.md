The variable `digits` is assigned a new empty set. The other variables, `n` and `cubes`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer in the range 1 to 3, `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers based on input values, and `digits` is an empty set.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 1 to 3, `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers based on input values, `digits` is an empty set**
