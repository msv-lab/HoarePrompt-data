The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and a list `cubes` containing `n` lists, each with 6 integers (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9). It returns the maximum number `x` of consecutive integers starting from 1 that can be formed using the faces of those cubes. The function relies on an external method `can_form_number` to determine if each integer can be formed, which is not defined in the provided code and may introduce missing functionality related to checking the ability to represent each consecutive integer. Therefore, the function's behavior in relation to invalid input or the specifics of how `can_form_number` operates is not accounted for in the annotations.
