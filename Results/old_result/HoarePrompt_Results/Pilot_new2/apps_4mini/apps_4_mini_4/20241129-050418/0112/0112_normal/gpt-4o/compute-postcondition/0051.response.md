The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous state of `found` was `False`, and since no other variables are affected by this assignment, we retain all other conditions. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`n` must be at least 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `used_cubes[0]` is True, and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[0]**
