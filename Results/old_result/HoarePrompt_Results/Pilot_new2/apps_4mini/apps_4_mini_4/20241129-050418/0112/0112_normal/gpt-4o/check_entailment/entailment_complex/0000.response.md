To analyze the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to check if it adheres to the problem description and correctly handles all potential cases.

### Problem Description Recap:
Masha has a set of cubes, each with digits on their faces, and she aims to form all natural numbers from 1 to some maximum x. The key points are:
1. The digits cannot have leading zeros.
2. The digits must be formed using the cubes, and each cube can only show one digit at a time.
3. The digits 6 and 9 are distinct and cannot be interchanged.

### Code Analysis:
The program consists of two main functions:
1. **func_1(n, cubes)**: This function determines the maximum x such that all integers from 1 to x can be formed using the digits on the cubes.
   - It uses a loop that checks if each integer (starting from 1) can be formed until it fails to form a number.
   
2. **can_form_number(num)**: This function checks if a given number can be formed using the digits on the cubes.
   - It converts the number to its digits and checks if each digit can be matched with the available cubes, ensuring that each cube is used at most once.

### Edge Cases:
1. The check for leading zeros is implicitly handled in the main loop of `func_1` since it starts checking from 1 (thereby skipping 0). However, if the first usable number is 10, it could lead to ambiguous cases where digits would need to be used in a way that would create confusion with leading zeros.
  
2. The program does not explicitly mention how it handles numbers that have digits that cannot be formed due to the constraints of the cubes. For example, if all cubes have faces that do not include certain digits (like 8 for the input case), it could fail.

3. The `can_form_number` function only checks that each digit can be matched with a cube and doesn't account for potential conflicts if the digit on a face has already been used for another digit in the same number.

### Example Cases:
Let's evaluate against the given examples:
1. For the input:
   ```
   3
   0 1 2 3 4 5
   6 7 8 9 0 1
   2 3 4 5 6 7
   ```
   The output said to be 87 is accurate because Masha can form all integers from 1 to 87, but cannot form 88 due to a lack of two cubes with the digit 8.

2. For the input:
   ```
   3
   0 1 3 5 6 8
   1 2 4 5 7 8
   2 3 4 6 7 9
   ```
   The output of 98 seems to be correct when checking the digits available versus what needs to be formed. 

However, if we consider the edge cases:
- If the cubes do not contain the digit '8' at all, the program would not be able to form 88, but it might incorrectly report that it can form numbers higher than 88 depending on the implementation of `can_form_number`.

### Conclusion:
Given the program relies heavily on an external function that is not fully defined, along with possible edge cases regarding leading zeros and specific digits being unavailable, we can conclude:

Correctness: **False**

**Reason**: The program does not explicitly handle leading zeros in numbers and may incorrectly allow for digits that cannot actually be formed due to cube face limitations, particularly in cases with digits 6 and 9 being confused, especially given their unique requirement in the problem description.
