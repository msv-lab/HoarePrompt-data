The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 3 ≤ `n`; `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 2 characters; `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list; `found` is True; `i` is 2; `used_cubes[2]` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
