According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` in relation to `n`. The loop iterates from 0 to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. This means `i` will be 1 at the start of the next iteration. Therefore, the conditions for `n` must be such that it is greater than 1 (to allow for `i` to reach 1). 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 2 characters, `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list, `found` is set to True, `i` is 1, and the current value of `used_cubes[i]` is True if `digit` is present in `cube_faces[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
