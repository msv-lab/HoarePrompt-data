The code updates the set `digits` with string representations of the integers in the list `cube`. The value of `n` is 2 or 3, which means `cubes` contains either 2 or 3 lists of integers, and `cube` is the second list in `cubes`. The specific integers in `cube` will determine what new string values are added to `digits`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer in the range 2 to 3, `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, `digits` is updated to include string representations of the integers in `cube`.**
