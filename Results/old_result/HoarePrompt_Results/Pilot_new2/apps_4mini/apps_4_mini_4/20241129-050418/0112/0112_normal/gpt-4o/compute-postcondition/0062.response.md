The code `break` indicates that we exit the most internal loop or conditional statement that we are currently in. However, since no variables are modified or values changed directly by this command, the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

The output state will reflect the conditions that still hold true after executing the break statement. The values of `n`, `digits`, `digit`, `i`, `used_cubes[4]`, and `found` remain unchanged as we merely break out of a loop or conditional.

Output State: **`n` is at least 5, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 3 characters, `digit` is the third character in the `digits` list, `i` is 4, `used_cubes[4]` is True, and `found` is True; we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
