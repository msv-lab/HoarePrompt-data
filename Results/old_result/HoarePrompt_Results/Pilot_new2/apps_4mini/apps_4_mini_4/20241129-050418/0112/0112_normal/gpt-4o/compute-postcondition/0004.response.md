According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `n`, which can take values of 1, 2, or 3. This means that the loop will execute a number of iterations equal to `n`. Since `n` is guaranteed to be between 1 and 3, the loop can execute as is. 

The variable `i` will start at 0 when the loop begins. The value of `found` does not affect the execution of the loop but may be relevant for the logic within the loop body. The variable `digit` is set to the first character of the `digits` list, which implies that it will represent the first digit for the first iteration of the loop.

Thus, the necessary states to note for the loop to execute correctly are that `n` is within the specified range (which it is) and that `i` should start at 0 for the first iteration.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `i` is 0, `found` is False**
