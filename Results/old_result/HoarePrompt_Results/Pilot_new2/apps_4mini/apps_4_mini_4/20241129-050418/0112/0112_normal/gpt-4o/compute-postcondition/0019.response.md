Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 1 character, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `i` is 2, and `found` is True. If `used_cubes[2]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[2]`, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
