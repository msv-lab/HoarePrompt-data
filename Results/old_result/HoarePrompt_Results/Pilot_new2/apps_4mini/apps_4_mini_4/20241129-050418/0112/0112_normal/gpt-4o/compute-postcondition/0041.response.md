Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 3 â‰¤ `n`; `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of `num` with at least 2 characters; `digit` is the second character in the `digits` list; `found` is True; `i` is 2; if `used_cubes[2]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there are no changes made to any of the variables.***
