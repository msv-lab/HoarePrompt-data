According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `alphabet`. The loop will iterate over each character in `alphabet`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` does not contain `char`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last character that was present in `s`. This implies that `char` is currently pointing to a specific character in `alphabet`, and for the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be the next character in the sequence.

If `char` is the next character in the alphabet, it means that in the next iteration, `char` will move to the subsequent character in `alphabet`. Therefore, for the loop to continue, `char` must be updated to the next character in `alphabet`, which will be the character after the current `char`.

State: **`s` does not contain `char`, `res` contains all initial occurrences of characters starting from the original value of `char` replaced up until the last valid occurrence, `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the current `char**.
