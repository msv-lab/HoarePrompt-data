Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `s` if `s` contains all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order; `i` is less than the length of `s` if `s` does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order; `j` is equal to the number of characters from the beginning of `target` that were matched in sequence with `s`, which can be between 0 and 26; if `j` is less than 26, `len(s)` is greater than `i` and `j` is less than `target_len`.**
