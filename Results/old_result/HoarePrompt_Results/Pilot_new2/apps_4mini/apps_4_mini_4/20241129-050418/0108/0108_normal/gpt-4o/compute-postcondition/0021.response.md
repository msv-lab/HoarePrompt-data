The code `print(-1)` simply outputs the value `-1` to the console. It does not modify any variables or change the state of the program in terms of variable values. Therefore, the previous conditions remain unchanged.

Output State: **`i` is equal to the length of `s` if `s` contains all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order; `i` is less than the length of `s` if `s` does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z' in order; `j` is equal to the number of characters from the beginning of `target` that were matched in sequence with `s`, which can be between 0 and 26; if `j` is less than 26, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `j` is less than `target_len`; and `j` is not equal to `target_len`. A value of -1 has been printed.**
