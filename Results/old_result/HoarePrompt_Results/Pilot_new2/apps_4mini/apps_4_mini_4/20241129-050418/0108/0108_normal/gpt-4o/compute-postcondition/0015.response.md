Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1, maintaining that `i` is greater than its previous value by 1 and `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `j` remains less than `target_len`.***
