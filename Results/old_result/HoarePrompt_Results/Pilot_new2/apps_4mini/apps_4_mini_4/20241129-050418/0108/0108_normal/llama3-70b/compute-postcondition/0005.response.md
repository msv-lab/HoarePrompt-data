The code appends the value of `char` (which is 'a') to the string `res`. Initially, `res` is an empty string, so after the execution of the code, `res` will be equal to 'a'. The other variables (`s`, `alphabet`, and `char`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` must include 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` must include 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
