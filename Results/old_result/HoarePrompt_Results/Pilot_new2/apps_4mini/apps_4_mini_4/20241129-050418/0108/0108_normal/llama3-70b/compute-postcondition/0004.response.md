According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and its presence in the string `s`. The loop will execute as long as `char` is in `s`. Right before the loop, `char` is 'a' on the first iteration, but for the loop to execute at least once, the string `s` must contain the character 'a'.

Thus, `s` must be adjusted to ensure that it includes 'a'. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` must include 'a', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
