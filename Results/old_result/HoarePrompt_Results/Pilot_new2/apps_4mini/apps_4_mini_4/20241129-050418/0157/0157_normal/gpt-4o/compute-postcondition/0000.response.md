`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `b` and `c` remain unchanged and are still positive integers within the specified range. The specific value of `a` after execution will depend on the user input but will also remain a positive integer.

Output State: **`a` is a positive integer (input value), `b` is a positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `c` is a positive integer (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000)**
