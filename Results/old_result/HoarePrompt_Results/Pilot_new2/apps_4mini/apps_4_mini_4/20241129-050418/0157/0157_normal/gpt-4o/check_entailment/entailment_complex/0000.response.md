Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Hereâ€™s why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Reading**: The function reads three integers from input, which represent the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`). This aligns with the problem's requirement for the input format.

2. **Ratio Calculation**: The program calculates `max_lemons` using the expression `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This correctly determines the maximum number of complete sets of fruits (1 lemon, 2 apples, and 4 pears) that can be formed based on the available quantities of each fruit:
   - `a` limits the number of lemons,
   - `b // 2` limits the number of apples since each set requires 2 apples,
   - `c // 4` limits the number of pears since each set requires 4 pears.
   
   By taking the minimum of these three values, the program ensures that the ratio is respected.

3. **Total Fruits Calculation**: The total number of fruits used in the compote is computed as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`. This correctly sums the number of each type of fruit used in the compote based on the maximum number of sets determined earlier.

4. **Output**: Finally, the program prints the total number of fruits. This output matches the expected result outlined in the problem description, which requires the total number of fruits used in making the compote.

5. **Handling Edge Cases**: In cases where the quantities of fruits do not allow for any complete sets (e.g., not enough pears, apples, or lemons), the calculation of `max_lemons` will correctly yield zero, resulting in an output of 0, which is also aligned with the problem description.

Overall, the program meets all the requirements set forth in the problem description for any valid input according to the defined ranges. Thus, it is correct.
