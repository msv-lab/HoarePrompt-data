The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Given that `a`, `b`, and `c` are input positive integers within the specified ranges, the precise value of `min_lemon` will depend on the specific values of `a`, `b`, and `c` that were input. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ a ≤ 1000), `b` is an input positive integer (1 ≤ b ≤ 1000), `c` is an input integer (1 ≤ c ≤ 1000), `min_lemon` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4)**.
