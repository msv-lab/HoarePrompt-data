Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make the compote in the proper ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The program reads the number of lemons `a`, apples `b`, and pears `c` from input.
2. It determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used by taking the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`).
   - Half the number of apples available (`b // 2`), since 2 apples are needed for each lemon.
   - A quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`), since 4 pears are needed for each lemon.
3. This minimum value (`min_lemon`) represents the maximum number of lemons that can be used while still being able to maintain the required ratio of apples and pears.
4. Finally, it calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote by summing:
   - `min_lemon` (lemons)
   - `min_lemon * 2` (apples)
   - `min_lemon * 4` (pears)
5. The result is printed, which represents the total number of fruits that can be used.

The code correctly handles all cases, including edge cases where there are not enough fruits of one type to meet the ratio requirement, resulting in a total of 0. 

Testing with the provided examples confirms that the implementation is sound and meets the problem's requirements. Therefore, the program is correct.
