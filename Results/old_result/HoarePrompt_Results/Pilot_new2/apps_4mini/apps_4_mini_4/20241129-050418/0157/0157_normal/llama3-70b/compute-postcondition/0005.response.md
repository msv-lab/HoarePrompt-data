The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters through its signature as provided. However, it is implied that the function operates with three positive integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `a` represents the number of lemons, `b` represents the number of apples, and `c` represents the number of pears. All three integers must satisfy the condition 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function's behavior or output based on these inputs has not been described in the provided information. Therefore, the expected functionality outline cannot be completed without additional details regarding the output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three positive integers a, b, and c, representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears, respectively, with the condition 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000, but the specific return value or behavior is not defined.**
