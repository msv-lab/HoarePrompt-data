The variable `s` is assigned a new value that is a list of integers created by mapping the input from the user (which is space-separated integers) to an integer type. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `b` remain unaffected. The value of `s` will now represent the input list of integers corresponding to the prices of shares. 

Assuming the user input is valid and consists of `n` integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000); `s` is a list of `n` integers representing the prices of shares as entered by the user, and `b` is a list of `m` integers (1 <= bi <= 1000).**
