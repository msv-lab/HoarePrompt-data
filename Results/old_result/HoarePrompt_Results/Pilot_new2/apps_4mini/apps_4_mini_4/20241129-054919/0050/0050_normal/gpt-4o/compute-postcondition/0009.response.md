The value of `remaining_bourles` is assigned the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`. Given that `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000) and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, which contains `n` integers (1 <= n <= 30), `remaining_bourles` will be a non-negative integer less than `min_buy_price`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of `n` integers representing the prices of shares as entered by the user, `b` is a list of `m` integers created from user input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of the list `b`, `max_shares` is `r // min_buy_price`, and `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer (1 <= n <= 30), `m` is an input positive integer (1 <= m <= 30), `r` is an input positive integer (1 <= r <= 1000), `s` is a list of `n` integers representing the prices of shares as entered by the user, `b` is a list of `m` integers created from user input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of the list `b`, `max_shares` is `r // min_buy_price`, and `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price`.**
