According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. The loop will execute `k` times if `k` is at least 2, as specified in the problem statement. Given the initial state, the loop can start executing with `i` initialized to 0. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` would be equal to `k - 1`. However, since we are focused on the state before the loop begins, we need to ensure that `i` starts at 0 and that there is no assumption about the outcome of the loop since the loop body is omitted.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we ensure that the necessary conditions for `k` and the initialization of `i` are satisfied.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\), `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**
