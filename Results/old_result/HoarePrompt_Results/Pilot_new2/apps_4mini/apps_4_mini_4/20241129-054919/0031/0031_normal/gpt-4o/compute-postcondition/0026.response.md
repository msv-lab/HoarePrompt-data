To determine the output state after executing the provided code snippet, we begin with the initial state and analyze the impact of the `print` statement.

Initial State: 
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18
- `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18
- `MOD` is 1000003
- `total_days` is equal to 2^n
- `numerator` is the product of (2^n - i) % 1000003 for i in the range from 0 to k-1
- `denominator` is equal to (2^n)^k % 1000003
- `p_no_shared` is equal to numerator
- `p_total` is equal to (2^n)^k % 1000003
- `p_shared` is equal to (p_total - numerator + 1000003) % 1000003
- `A` is equal to p_shared // g
- `B` is equal to p_total // g
- `g` is the result of func_1(A, B)

Now, the `print(A % MOD, B % MOD)` statement will calculate the values of `A` and `B` modulo `MOD`. 

The values of `A` and `B` are defined based on the previously calculated values:
- `A` is defined as `p_shared // g`
- `B` is defined as `p_total // g`

While we cannot determine the exact numeric values of `A` and `B` without knowing the specific outputs of the prior calculations, we know that both will yield results that fall within the range defined by `MOD` (0 to 1000002).

After the execution of the print statement, the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `MOD` is 1000003; `total_days` is equal to 2^n; `numerator` is the product of (2^n - i) % 1000003 for i in the range from 0 to k-1; `denominator` is equal to (2^n)^k % 1000003; `p_no_shared` is equal to numerator; `p_total` is equal to (2^n)^k % 1000003; `p_shared` is equal to (p_total - numerator + 1000003) % 1000003; `A` is equal to p_shared // g; `B` is equal to p_total // g; `g` is the result of func_1(A, B); the values printed are `A % MOD` and `B % MOD`.**
