In the given code snippet, `numerator` is updated by multiplying it with `(total_days - i)` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The previous value of `numerator` is 1, `total_days` is equal to `2^n`, and `i` is 0.

1. Calculate `total_days - i`:
   - Since `i` is 0, the expression simplifies to `total_days`, which is `2^n`.

2. Update `numerator`:
   - The new value of `numerator` becomes `1 * (2^n) % 1000003`, which is simply `(2^n) % 1000003`.

The other variables `n`, `k`, `MOD`, `denominator`, and `i` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is equal to `2^n`, `numerator` is equal to `(2^n) % 1000003`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**.
