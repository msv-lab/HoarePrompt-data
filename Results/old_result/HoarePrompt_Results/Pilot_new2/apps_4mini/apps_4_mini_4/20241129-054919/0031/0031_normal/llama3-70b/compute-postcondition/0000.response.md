`total_days` is assigned the value of `2` raised to the power of `n`. The value of `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), so `total_days` will be equal to \(2^n\). The other variables, `k` remains unaffected. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18; `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; `total_days` is equal to \(2^n\).**
