To assess the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the key aspects of the implementation.

The problem requires computing the probability that at least two people out of `k` share the same birthday among `2^n` possible birthdays (days). The result must be returned as an irreducible fraction `A/B`, where both `A` and `B` should be taken modulo `10^6 + 3`.

### Analysis of the Program
1. **GCD Calculation**: The `func_1` function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two numbers, which is used to simplify `A` and `B`.

2. **Probability Calculation**: The `func_2` function calculates the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday. It does so by first calculating the probability of no shared birthdays (`p_no_shared`), then subtracting this from the total possibilities to get the probability of at least one shared birthday (`p_shared`).

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program handles the case where `k > 2^n` by directly returning `1 1`, indicating that it's guaranteed at least two people share a birthday in that case.
   - It also correctly calculates the numerator and denominator based on the number of people and total days.

### Potential Issues
The main concern arises with the sizes of `n` and `k`, which can be as large as `10^18`. Python allows for large integer computations, but it is essential to check:
- **Overflow in Computation**: The program may face issues with extremely large values of `n` and `k`, especially with the multiplication in the loop which computes `numerator` and `denominator`. The factorial-like growth in the iteration (`k` times) could lead to very large numbers before taking the modulo, even if Python handles large integers.

### Test Case to Highlight Potential Failure
Let's consider a theoretical case:
- Input: `n = 60`, `k = 61`
  - Here, `2^60` is already a massive number, and since `k` is greater than `2^60`, the return value should be `1 1` because it's guaranteed that at least two of the 61 people must share a birthday. The program handles this correctly.
  
- Now, consider `n = 60` and `k = 2`:
  - Expected output: Calculate `p_shared` and `p_total`. Here, the loop runs only once (`k = 2`), which should not cause overflow, but still, if large multiplication occurs improperly before taking modulo, it could lead to incorrect results.

- For `n = 1` and `k = 3`, where the expected output is also `1 1`, the program correctly identifies that the input is invalid based on the birthday paradox.

### Conclusion
While the program works correctly for provided examples and handles a lot of edge cases, the potential for very large calculations in the `numerator` and `denominator` could lead to errors if the intermediate values are not properly managed in terms of modular reductions. 

Thus, I conclude:
Correctness: **False**. 

The program has the potential to fail on extreme edge cases due to large integer multiplication before applying modulo, which could be avoided by consistently taking modulo at each multiplication step within the loop.
