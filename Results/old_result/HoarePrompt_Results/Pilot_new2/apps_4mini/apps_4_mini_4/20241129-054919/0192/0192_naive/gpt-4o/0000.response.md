To analyze the given program against the problem description, we need to understand what the program is trying to accomplish.

The problem requires us to find the minimum number of seconds needed to change the side length of an equilateral triangle from `x` to `y`, where `x` is greater than `y`. The changes must adhere to the condition of forming a non-degenerate triangle, meaning that the lengths of the sides must remain valid at all times.

The program is as follows:
```python
(x, y) = map(int, input().split())
print((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2)
```

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Conditions**: The input `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000`. This condition is correctly handled as the program expects two integers.

2. **Calculation Logic**:
   - The program computes the difference: `x - y`.
   - The expression `(x - y) // 2` calculates how many full operations can be done where two sides can change simultaneously.
   - The term `(x - y) % 2` accounts for an additional operation if there is an odd difference, which means one more second is needed to change the last side.

### Potential Case to Test:

Let's consider the specific case when `x=6` and `y=3`.
- The expected output for this case, as detailed in the description, is `4`.
- The program evaluates: 

  \[
  \text{Output} = (6 - 3) // 2 + (6 - 3) \% 2 = 3 // 2 + 3 \% 2 = 1 + 1 = 2
  \]

The output from the program is `2`, which does not match the expected output of `4`. 

### Conclusion:

Since we found a specific case (`x = 6`, `y = 3`) where the program fails to produce the correct minimum number of seconds required to achieve the triangle transformation as described, we can conclude that the program is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**.
