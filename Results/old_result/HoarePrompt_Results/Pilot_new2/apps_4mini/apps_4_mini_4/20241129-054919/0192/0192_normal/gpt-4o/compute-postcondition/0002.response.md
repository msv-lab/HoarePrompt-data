The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters, as indicated by the empty parentheses in the function definition. However, it operates under the constraint that `x` and `y` are integers with the relationships \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). 

The output of the function is not specified in the prompt, so we cannot determine specific return values or cases based on these constraints. Therefore, without additional information regarding the outputs or behavior of the function when `x` and `y` meet the specified constraints, we can only describe the nature of the inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers, x and y, which are constrained such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The specific return value is not provided.**
