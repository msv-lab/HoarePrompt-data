Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers represented as strings, each potentially containing leading zeros and up to 10^6 digits. It compares the two integers after stripping leading zeros and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if the first integer is less than the second, or '>' if the first integer is greater than the second.**
