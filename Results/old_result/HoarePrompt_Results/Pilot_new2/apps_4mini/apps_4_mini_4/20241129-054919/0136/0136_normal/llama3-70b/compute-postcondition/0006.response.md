The code snippet `print('<')` outputs the string `<`. The values of the variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged after the execution of the print statement. The conditions regarding `a` and `b` are still valid, as they are not affected by the print operation. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged states of `a` and `b` along with the action of printing.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `a` is not equal to `b`, `a` is less than `b`, and the string `<` has been printed.**
