The variable `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` after removing leading zeros using the `lstrip('0')` method. Since `b` is a string and `data[1]` is also a string derived from the input, the leading zeros are stripped off, but the remaining value will still be a non-negative integer in string format. The states of the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the non-negative integer represented by `data[0]` without leading zeros, `b` is `data[1]` with leading zeros removed, and `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.

Output State: **`a` is the non-negative integer represented by `data[0]` without leading zeros, `b` is `data[1]` with leading zeros removed, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
