Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the requirements specified in the problem description. Here's why it meets the criteria:

1. **Input Handling**: The program uses `input()` to read the two integers as strings, which is in line with the problem requirement to read whole lines of input. Although the annotation mentions `raw_input()` for Python 2, since the problem does not specify a particular version of Python and `input()` is valid in Python 3, this is acceptable.

2. **Leading Zeros**: The function uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeros from the input strings. This correctly handles the specified requirement that the input may contain leading zeros and that they should be ignored for the purposes of the comparison.

3. **String Comparison**: After stripping leading zeros, the program correctly compares the two strings. Python's string comparison works lexicographically, and since all leading zeroes have been removed, this will yield the correct numerical comparison results.

4. **Output Requirements**: The program properly checks for equality first and prints '=' if the two numbers are equal. If not equal, it checks which number is greater and prints either '<' or '>', as required by the problem description.

5. **Efficiency**: The program reads the entire input line at once and performs string manipulation and comparisons, which is efficient and suitable for handling very large integers (up to 1 million digits).

In summary, the program successfully adheres to the problem requirements by effectively handling input, properly stripping leading zeros, accurately comparing the values, and producing the correct output. Thus, it correctly implements the functionality as specified.
