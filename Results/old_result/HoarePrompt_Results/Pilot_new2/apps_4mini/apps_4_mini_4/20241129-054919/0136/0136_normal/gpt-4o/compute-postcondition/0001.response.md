The variable `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` after removing any leading zeros with the `lstrip('0')` method. Since `a` is originally a non-negative integer represented as a string, the value of `data[0]` will determine the new value of `a`. If `data[0]` consists only of zeros, `a` will become an empty string. The states of `b` and `data` are not affected.

Output State: **`a` is the non-negative integer represented by `data[0]` without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
