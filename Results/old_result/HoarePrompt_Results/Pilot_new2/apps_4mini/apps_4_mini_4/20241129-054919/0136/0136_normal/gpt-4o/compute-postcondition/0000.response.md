The variable `data` is assigned the result of `input().split()`. This means that `data` will contain a list of strings which are the non-negative integer values provided as input. The variables `a` and `b` retain their values as non-negative integers represented as strings, but we cannot determine their exact values as they are not modified by the code.

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input**.
