Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented by `data[0]` without leading zeros; if `a` is '0', then `b` is '0' and `data` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; if `a` is not '0', then `b` and `data` remain unchanged; the value of `a` is equal to `b`, and the length of `a` is equal to the length of `b`; '=' is printed.**
