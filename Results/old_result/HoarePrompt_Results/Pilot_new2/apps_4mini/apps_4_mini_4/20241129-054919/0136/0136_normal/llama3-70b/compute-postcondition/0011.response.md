The function `func` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing at most 10^6 digits, and they may have leading zeroes. The function presumably performs an operation with these inputs, though the specifics of that operation are not provided. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two string parameters representing non-negative integers.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, which are non-negative integers represented as strings, each containing at most 10^6 digits and may have leading zeroes.**
