The code `print('<')` will output the character '<' to the console. It does not alter any of the variables `a`, `b`, or `data`. The condition regarding the values of these variables remains valid post-execution. 

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented by `data[0]` without leading zeros; if `a` is '0', then `b` is '0' and `data` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input; if `a` is not '0', `b` and `data` remain unchanged; the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`; the output printed is '<'.**
