In the given scenario, the variable `b` is assigned the value `'0'`. The initial state specifies that `a` is a non-negative integer represented by `data[0]`. If `a` is '0', then `b` takes the value of `'0'` as specified. Since `b` is initially empty and is now assigned a value, we assume `a` is indeed '0'.

The state of `data` remains unchanged in this execution.

Thus, the output state is:
- `a` is '0'
- `b` is now '0'
- `data` remains a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.

Output State: **`a` is '0', `b` is '0', `data` is a list of strings obtained from splitting the input.**
