The code `print('=')` produces output to the console but does not modify any variables or states. The variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is:

Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros after stripping any leading zeros from the input, and the current value of `a` is equal to the current value of `b`.**
