#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10.
def func_1(n, k):
    min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2
    if (min_sum > n) :
        return -1
        #The program returns -1 because the current value of min_sum is greater than n.
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2; and `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`.
    d = n // min_sum
    remainder = n - d * min_sum
    sequence = [(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10 and 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10; `remainder` is 0; `sequence` contains values that are incremented from their original values according to the number of times the loop executed, specifically the last `original_remainder` indices of `sequence` have been incremented by 1, where `original_remainder` is the initial value of `remainder`.
    return sequence
    #The program returns the modified 'sequence' where the last 'original_remainder' indices have been incremented by 1, based on the initial value of 'remainder' which is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It first calculates the minimum sum required to form a sequence of `k` distinct positive integers. If this minimum sum exceeds `n`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it computes a sequence of `k` integers where the first integer is the integer division of `n` by the minimum sum, and the remaining integers are incremented based on the remainder of that division. The function ultimately returns this modified sequence. If `n` is exactly equal to the minimum sum, the sequence will consist of `k` equal integers.
