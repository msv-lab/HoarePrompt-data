To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we analyze the provided state:

1. `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{10}\).
2. `k` is also a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{10}\).
3. `min_sum` is defined as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which is the sum of the first `k` positive integers.
4. It is given that `min_sum` must be less than or equal to `n`, ensuring that there is enough total value to distribute among the sequence.
5. `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, which represents how many complete sequences of the first `k` integers can fit into `n`.
6. `remainder` is defined as `n - (n // min_sum) * (k * (k + 1) // 2)`, representing what's left after distributing the complete sequences.
7. `sequence` is a list of length `k` with values `[d * (1), d * (2), ..., d * (k)]`, which means it starts with `0` for the first iteration of `i` being `k - 1`.

Now, considering the `for` loop statement:

```python
for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):
```

This loop will iterate from `k - 1` down to `0`. For this loop to execute, `k` must be at least `1`, because if `k` equals `0`, the range becomes invalid and the loop will not execute.

So, we summarize the necessary states:

- `k` must be at least `1` (which is already given).
- `i` will start at `k - 1` and will decrement until it reaches `0`, so we can set `i` to `k - 1` before the loop begins.

Thus, the final answer reflecting the adjusted states would be:

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to `k * (k + 1) // 2 and is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum, `remainder` is equal to `n - (n // min_sum) * (k * (k + 1) // 2), `sequence` is a list of length `k`, `i` is `k - 1`**.
