To determine if the provided program meets the requirements of the problem description, we need to analyze both the problem and the program's logic.

**Problem Description Recap:**
1. We need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum up to `n`.
2. The greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence should be maximized.
3. If no sequence can be formed, return `-1`.

**Program Logic Overview:**
1. The program first calculates `min_sum`, which is the minimum possible sum for the first `k` positive integers: `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
2. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it returns `-1`, correctly identifying that it's impossible to create a valid sequence.
3. If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, it calculates a divisor `d` by dividing `n` by `min_sum`, which represents how many times we can scale the minimum sequence.
4. It then calculates the `remainder`, which is the leftover when `n` is adjusted by the scaled minimum sum.
5. The program constructs the initial sequence and then adjusts the last elements of the sequence by distributing the `remainder`.

**Checking Correctness:**
- The program correctly checks if a valid sequence can be formed by comparing `min_sum` with `n`.
- It creates a sequence of `k` integers that start at multiples of `d` (i.e., `d * 1`, `d * 2`, ..., `d * k`), ensuring the numbers are strictly increasing.
- The logic to handle the `remainder` by incrementing the last elements in the sequence ensures that the sum equals `n` after the modifications.
- The GCD of the numbers in the sequence will be maximized since every number in the sequence is a multiple of `d`.

**Conclusion:**
The program adheres to the requirements set forth in the problem description for all specified cases. It correctly handles the formation of the sequence, the checking of conditions, and the distribution of the remainder, while ensuring the GCD is maximized.

Correctness: **True**
