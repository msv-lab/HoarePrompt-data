According to the code, the loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to `0`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `0` (since the loop decrements `i` each time). The loop will execute one more time if `i` is decremented again, which will lead to `i` being `-1`. 

Since the loop uses a range with a step of `-1`, there will not be another valid value for `i` under the condition of the current loop structure. 

Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `k` must be incremented, allowing the starting value of `i` to be greater than or equal to `0`. If `k` is incremented by 1, `i` will become `k - 1`, allowing the loop to execute for that new value.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10 and 1 ≤ `k + 1` ≤ 10^10; `remainder` equals -1, `d` is equal to `n // min_sum`, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1; `i` is now equal to `k`**
