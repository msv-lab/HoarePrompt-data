The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are positive integers constrained such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. After executing the function body, if the current value of `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. In another case, the function returns the modified `sequence` where the last `original_remainder` indices have been incremented by 1, based on the initial value of `remainder`, which is 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and either return -1 if a certain condition on `min_sum` is met, or return a modified sequence based on the input parameters. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, returns -1 if min_sum is greater than n; otherwise, it returns the modified sequence where the last original_remainder indices have been incremented by 1.**
