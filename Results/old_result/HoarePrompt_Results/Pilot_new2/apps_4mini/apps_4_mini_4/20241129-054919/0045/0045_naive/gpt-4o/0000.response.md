To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze the logic implemented in the code and see if it handles all potential edge cases according to the requirements.

The problem states that we need to create a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers such that their sum is equal to `n` and the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the sequence is maximal. If no such sequence can be formed, we should return `-1`.

Here's a step-by-step analysis of the program:

1. The program calculates `min_sum`, which is the minimum sum of the first `k` natural numbers: `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`. This is correct because the smallest strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers would be `1, 2, ..., k`, and their sum is indeed `min_sum`.

2. The program checks if `min_sum` is greater than `n`. If it is, it returns `-1`, which is correct since it is impossible to form a sequence summing to `n` if the minimum required sum exceeds `n`.

3. The program calculates `d = n // min_sum` and uses this to form a base sequence: `sequence = [d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`. This is intended to construct a sequence where each element `a_i = d * i` for `i` ranging from `1` to `k`.

4. The program then calculates the `remainder = n - d * min_sum`, which represents how much more we need to distribute among the elements of the sequence while keeping them strictly increasing.

5. The program attempts to distribute the `remainder` to the last elements of the sequence, incrementing them one by one until the remainder is exhausted.

Now, we need to check for the correctness of the logic:

- The key point is whether the constructed sequence's GCD is indeed maximal. The GCD of the sequence `sequence = [d * (i + 1)] + [increments]` is influenced by `d`. However, adding increments could potentially alter the GCD from being maximal if not handled correctly.

**Counterexample**: 

If `n = 10` and `k = 3`, the minimum sum `min_sum` is `6`, allowing a sequence like `1, 2, 3` (where `d=1`, `remainder=4`). The code can give a sequence like `2, 3, 5` (by distributing `4`), where the GCD is `1`. However, a better sequence could have been `2, 3, 5` (which is valid but has a GCD of `1` instead of `2` which would have been possible). 

In the case where the remainder can be distributed unevenly, the GCD can drop below the maximal potential GCD. 

Thus, the program fails to guarantee that the GCD of the resulting sequence is maximal.

Correctness: **False**.
