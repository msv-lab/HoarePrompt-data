To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and identify potential edge cases.

### Problem Analysis
The problem requires creating a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive integers that sum to `n`, while maximizing their greatest common divisor (GCD). If it's not possible to create such a sequence, the function should return `-1`.

### Program Analysis
The code does the following:
1. It calculates the minimum sum required for `k` distinct positive integers using the formula `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`.
2. It checks if `min_sum` exceeds `n`. If it does, it returns `-1`.
3. If feasible, it computes a sequence of `k` integers where:
   - The first integer is determined by `d = n // min_sum`.
   - It creates the sequence as `[d * (i + 1) for i in range(k)]`.
4. It distributes any remaining value (`remainder = n - d * min_sum`) across the last elements of the sequence.

### Edge Cases:
1. **Minimum Values**: For `n = 1` and `k = 1`, the output should be `[1]`. The code should correctly handle this case.
2. **Impossible Cases**: When `n < min_sum`, the function should return `-1`. For example, for `n = 5` and `k = 3`, it should return `-1`, which it does.
3. **Exact Minimum Sum**: When `n` equals the minimum sum, the sequence generated should consist of the first `k` integers, e.g., for `n = 6` and `k = 3`, it should return `[1, 2, 3]`.
4. **Multiple Valid Outputs**: The problem states that if multiple outputs exist, any can be returned. This is correctly handled by the implementation.

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints summarize the function's behavior accurately. They mention:
- The calculation of the minimum sum.
- The handling of cases where `min_sum > n`.
- The way the sequence is generated and adjusted with the `remainder`.

### Conclusion
The code follows the problem description and handles the edge cases identified above. There do not appear to be any scenarios where the program would fail according to the provided conditions.

Therefore, the conclusion is:

Correctness: **True**.
