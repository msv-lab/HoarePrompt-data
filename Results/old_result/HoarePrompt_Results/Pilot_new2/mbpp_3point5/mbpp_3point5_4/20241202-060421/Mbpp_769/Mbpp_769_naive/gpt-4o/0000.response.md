Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The function `func_1` takes two lists as input and finds the difference between them. It uses `symmetric_difference` method to find the elements that are present in only one of the lists. Then it converts the resulting set into a list and sorts it based on the index in the concatenated list of list1 and list2.

All the provided test cases pass and produce the expected output. The function correctly handles the requirement of finding the difference between two lists and ordering the elements based on their appearance in the input lists. 

Therefore, based on the provided information and the successful test cases, the program is considered correct.
