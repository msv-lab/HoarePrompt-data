The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. After executing the function body, the program returns a list `result_list` containing elements from `diff_elements` sorted based on their index in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists `list1` and `list2`, and return a sorted list `result_list` based on the index of elements from `diff_elements` in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two list parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted list result_list containing elements from diff_elements based on their index in the combined list of list1 and list2.**
