Functionality: ** The function func_1 takes two lists, list1 and list2, and creates a set of unique elements from each list. It then finds the symmetric difference between the two sets and converts it to a list called result_list. The elements in result_list are sorted based on their index in the combined list of list1 and list2. The function returns this sorted list.**
