The function accepts two lists, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted list of unique elements that are present in either list1 or list2, but not in both. The code successfully achieves this by using set operations to find the symmetric difference between the two lists and then sorts the result. No missing functionality or edge cases are present in the provided code.
