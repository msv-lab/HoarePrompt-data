Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a nested list structure and recursively flattens it by applying the function to each element in the list. The function correctly handles both nested lists and individual elements within the nested list. 

The program follows the problem description by correctly flattening the nested list structure, regardless of the data types present in the list. The function recursively processes each element in the nested list until all nested levels are flattened, resulting in a single flat list as output. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
