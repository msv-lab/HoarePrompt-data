According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has more items, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list has at least 1 item, and based on the conditions specified, flat_list is updated accordingly. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the nested_list must have more items. If the next item in nested_list is a list, flat_list should contain elements returned by func_1 applied to the next item in nested_list, and the current value of item should be a list. If the next item in nested_list is not a list, the next item from nested_list should be appended to flat_list.

State: **nested_list is a nested list structure that must have at least 2 items, flat_list is updated based on the conditions specified, and the value of item should be set according to the next item in nested_list.**
