According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list structure. If there are more elements in the nested_list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a nested list structure containing integers, strings, or other nested lists. The flat_list has been extended by the result of applying func_1 to each element in the nested_list. If the element is not a list, flat_list has appended the element. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be more elements left in the nested_list that have not been processed yet.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure containing integers, strings, or other nested lists. If the element is a list, then the current element is a list structure. The flat_list has been extended by the result of applying func_1 to each element in the nested_list. If the element is not a list, flat_list has appended the element.**
