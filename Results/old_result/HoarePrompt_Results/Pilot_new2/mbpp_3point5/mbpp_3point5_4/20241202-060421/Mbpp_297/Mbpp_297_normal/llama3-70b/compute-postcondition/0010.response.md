Postcondition: ***nested_list is a nested list structure containing integers, strings, or other nested lists. If the element is a list, then the current element is a list structure. flat_list has been extended by applying func_1 to each element in the nested_list. If the element is not a list, flat_list has appended the element after applying func_1. In both cases, the flat_list is updated with the respective processing of each element in the nested_list.***
