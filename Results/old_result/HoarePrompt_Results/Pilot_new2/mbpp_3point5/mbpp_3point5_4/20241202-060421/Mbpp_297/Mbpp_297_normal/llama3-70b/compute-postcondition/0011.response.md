According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the nested_list. If there are more elements left in the nested_list, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the previous iteration, nested_list is a nested list structure, and flat_list has been extended by applying func_1 to each element in the nested_list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next element in the nested_list needs to be processed. If the next element is a list, then the current element in the loop will be that list. If the next element is not a list, it will be appended to flat_list after applying func_1.

State: **nested_list is a nested list structure containing integers, strings, or other nested lists. flat_list has been extended by applying func_1 to the next element in the nested_list.**
