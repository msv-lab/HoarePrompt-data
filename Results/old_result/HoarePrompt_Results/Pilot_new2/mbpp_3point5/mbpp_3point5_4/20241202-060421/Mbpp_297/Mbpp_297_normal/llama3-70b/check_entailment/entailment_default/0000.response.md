Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description by accepting a nested list structure and recursively flattening it. It checks if each element is a list, and if so, applies the function recursively. Otherwise, it appends the element to the flattened list. The function then returns the flattened list, as described in the problem description. Additionally, the output hints also agree with the code by stating that the function recursively flattens the nested list by applying `func_1` to each element in the `nested_list` and returns the flattened list `flat_list`. Since the code matches the problem description and the output hints, we can conclude that it is correct.
