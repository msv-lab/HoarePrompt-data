Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a nested list structure as input and returns a flattened list containing all the elements from the nested list. It achieves this by recursively calling itself on any nested lists encountered and extending the `flat_list` with the flattened result.

The program correctly flattens the nested list structure as required by the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
