Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a nested list as input and returns a flat list containing all the elements of the input list in a flat structure. The program correctly checks if each item in the input list is a list itself, and if so, recursively flattens that sublist using the same function. The final flat list is then returned.

This program meets the requirements of the problem description as it flattens any given nested list structure correctly by recursively processing each sublist until a completely flat list is obtained. Hence, the program is correct and outputs the expected results as per the problem description.
