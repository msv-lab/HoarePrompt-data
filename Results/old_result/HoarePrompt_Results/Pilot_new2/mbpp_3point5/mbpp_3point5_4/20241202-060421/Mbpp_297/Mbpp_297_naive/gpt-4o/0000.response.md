Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function recursively flattens a nested list structure by iterating over each item in the list. If the item is a list, it recursively calls itself on that sublist. If the item is not a list, it appends the item to the flat_list. The program then returns the flattened list. The function has been tested with multiple nested list structures and it correctly flattens them into a single list as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
