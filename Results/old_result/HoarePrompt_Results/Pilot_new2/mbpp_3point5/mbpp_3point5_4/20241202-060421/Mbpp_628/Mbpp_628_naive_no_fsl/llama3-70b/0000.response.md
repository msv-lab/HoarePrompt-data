Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function that takes a string as input and uses the `replace` method to replace all spaces with '%20'. This implementation correctly aligns with the problem description, and for all potential cases where a string with spaces is provided, the program will replace them with '%20' as expected. Thus, the program is correct.
