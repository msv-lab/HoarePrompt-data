Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and uses the `replace` function to replace all spaces in the string with '%20', as required by the problem description. This implementation will work correctly for all cases where the input string contains spaces that need to be replaced. Therefore, the program follows the problem description and is correct.
