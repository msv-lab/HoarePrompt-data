Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of that string using the `upper()` method. This aligns with the problem description which asks for a function to convert a given string to uppercase. The program always accomplishes this task for any input string, making it correct.
