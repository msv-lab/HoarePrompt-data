Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as a parameter and returns the uppercase version of the string using the `upper()` method. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to convert a given string to uppercase. The program always fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
