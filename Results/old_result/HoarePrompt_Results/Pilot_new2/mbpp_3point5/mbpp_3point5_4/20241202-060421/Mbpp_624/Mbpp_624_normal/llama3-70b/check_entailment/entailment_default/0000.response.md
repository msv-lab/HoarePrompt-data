Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of the string using the `upper()` method in Python. The program aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should convert a given string to uppercase. Additionally, the output hints provided also confirm that the functionality of the code matches the expected behavior. Since the code works as expected for all potential cases and the output hints also agree with the code, we can conclude that the code is correct.
