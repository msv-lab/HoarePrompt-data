Explanation: 
The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price, which indicates no profit and no loss. The provided test cases cover scenarios where there is no profit (or loss) as well as scenarios where there is a profit or loss, and the function returns the expected results for all cases. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
