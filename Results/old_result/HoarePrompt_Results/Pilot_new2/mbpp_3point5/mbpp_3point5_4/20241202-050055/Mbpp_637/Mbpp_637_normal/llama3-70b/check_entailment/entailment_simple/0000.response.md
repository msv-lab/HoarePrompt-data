Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that checks if the cost price is equal to the selling price. This aligns with the problem description of checking whether the given amount has no profit and no loss. Since having the cost price equal to the selling price indicates no profit and no loss, the program is correct in fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
