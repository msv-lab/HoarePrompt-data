Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` simply checks if the cost price is equal to the selling price. This condition satisfies the requirement of having no profit and no loss, as in this case the profit would be zero. The program covers all potential cases where the cost price is equal to the selling price, making it correct.
