Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as parameters and returns a new list that contains all elements from `lst` followed by all elements from `tpl`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function to add the given tuple to the given list.

The program achieves this by converting the tuple `tpl` into a list using the `list()` function and then concatenating it with the original list `lst` using the `+` operator. This results in a new list that combines the elements of both the list and the tuple, exactly as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
