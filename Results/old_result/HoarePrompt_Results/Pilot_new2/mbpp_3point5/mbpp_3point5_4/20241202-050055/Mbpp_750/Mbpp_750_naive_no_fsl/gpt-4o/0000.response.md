Correctness: True

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, converts the tuple to a list using `list(tpl)`, and then concatenates it with the input list `lst`. The assert statements provided in the program test the function with different inputs and verify that the output is as expected. The function successfully adds the given tuple to the given list in all test cases provided. Hence, the program is correct.
