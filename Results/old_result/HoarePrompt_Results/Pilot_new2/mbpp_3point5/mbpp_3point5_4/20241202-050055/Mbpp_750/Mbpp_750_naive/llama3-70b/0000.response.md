Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input and then adds the elements of the tuple to the list. The program description simply asks to add the given tuple to the given list, and the code does exactly that by converting the tuple to a list using `list()` and then concatenating it with the original list using the `+` operator. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the program would not work as described, so the correctness is determined to be True.
