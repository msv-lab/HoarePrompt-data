Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that correctly finds the last digit of the factorial of a given number `n` if `n` is at least 5. It returns 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5, and it calculates the factorial and returns the last digit if `n` is at least 5. The annotations clearly indicate the behavior of the function and explain the logic behind the calculations.

The program correctly follows the problem description and provides the expected output for the specified cases. However, it should be clarified that for `n` less than 5, the program does not provide a valid output, which is a limitation mentioned in the annotations.
