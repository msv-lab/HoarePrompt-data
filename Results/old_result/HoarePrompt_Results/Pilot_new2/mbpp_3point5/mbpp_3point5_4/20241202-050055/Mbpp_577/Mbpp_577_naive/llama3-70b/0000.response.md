Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number. The program simply returns fixed values based on the input number without actually calculating the factorial. For example, when n = 5, the factorial of 5 is 120, and the last digit is 0. However, the program will return 0 without actually computing the factorial. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
