Correctness: False

The given program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number as described in the problem. The program simply returns 0 for any input greater than 4, which is incorrect.

For example, if we input 5, the factorial of 5 is 120, and the last digit is 0, not 4 as the program would return. This shows that the program does not work correctly for all potential cases as described in the problem.
