Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`.
- If the current value of `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0.
- If `n` is at least 5, the function correctly calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial.
- However, there is a missing edge case handling for the scenario where `n` is less than 5 since the code does not explicitly handle this case. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function should be clarified to state that if `n` is less than 5, the function does not provide a valid output.**
