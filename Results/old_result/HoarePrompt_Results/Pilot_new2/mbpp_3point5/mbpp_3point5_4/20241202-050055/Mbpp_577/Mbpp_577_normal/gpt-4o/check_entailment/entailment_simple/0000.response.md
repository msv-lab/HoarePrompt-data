Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the factorial of the given number and returns the last digit of the factorial if the number is less than 5, and returns 0 if the number is greater than or equal to 5. The program covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description, ensuring that the last digit of the factorial is returned for numbers at least 5.
