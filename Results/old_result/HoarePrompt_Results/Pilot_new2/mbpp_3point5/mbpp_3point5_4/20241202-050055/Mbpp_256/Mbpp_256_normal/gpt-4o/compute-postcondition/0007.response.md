According to the code, the loop can execute if i * i is less than n. The loop will iterate over j starting from i * i and incrementing by i until j is less than n. 

To ensure that the loop executes, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **n is a non-negative integer larger than 2, is_prime is a list of boolean values where is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False and all other elements are True, i is 2, i * i is less than n, and j is initialized to i * i**
