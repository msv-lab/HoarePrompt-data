The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n` and calculates the number of prime numbers between 2 and n. It iterates through the numbers from 2 to n-1, incrementing a count variable for each prime number found. The function then returns the total count of prime numbers. However, the code does not include a check for when n is less than 2, which could be considered to handle edge cases where n is 0 or 1.
