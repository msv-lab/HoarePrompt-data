Correctness: **True**

The program consists of two functions. The `is_prime` function correctly determines if a given number is prime or not. It checks if the number is less than 2 and returns False, otherwise, it iterates through numbers from 2 to the square root of the given number and checks if the number is divisible by any of these numbers. If it is divisible by any number, it returns False; otherwise, it returns True, correctly identifying prime numbers.

The `func_1` function correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number by iterating from 2 to the given number and using the `is_prime` function to determine if each number is prime. The count is then incremented for each prime number found, and the final count is returned.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly implements the functionality required.
