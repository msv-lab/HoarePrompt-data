According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `j` is within the range specified by `range(i * i, n, i)`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` list has is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False and all other elements are True, `i` is 4, `i * i` is less than `n`, `j` is 20, and `is_prime[j]` is False. 

For the loop to execute one more time:
- The value of `j` must still be within the range specified by `range(i * i, n, i)`, so `j` should be updated accordingly.
- Since `i` is used as the step value for the range function, `i` should remain the same.
- The conditions related to `n`, `is_prime`, and the values of `i * i`, `i`, and `j` must still hold true for the loop to continue.

State: **n is a non-negative integer larger than 2, is_prime is a list of boolean values where is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False and all other elements are True, i is 4, i * i is less than n, j is updated to the next value within the range specified by range(i * i, n, i), is_prime[j] is still False**
