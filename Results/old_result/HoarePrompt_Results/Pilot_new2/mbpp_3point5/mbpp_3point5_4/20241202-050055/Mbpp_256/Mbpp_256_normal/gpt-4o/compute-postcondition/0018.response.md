According to the code, the loop can execute as long as j is within the range of (i * i, n, i). Since i is 4, i * i is 16 and j is equal to i * i + i, which is 20. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, j needs to be less than n. Also, after the execution of the if block, all elements in the range(i * i, n, i) have been updated to False in is_prime if is_prime[i] is true, so is_prime[j] must be True for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **n is a non-negative integer larger than 2, is_prime is a list of boolean values where is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False and all other elements are True, i is 4, i * i is less than n, j is 20, is_prime[j] must be True**
