The function `is_prime` accepts a non-negative integer `num` and determines if it is a prime number. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. If `num` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `num`, the function returns False. If `num` is not divisible by 2 and is not divisible by 3, the function returns False. Otherwise, if none of the previous conditions are met, the function returns True, indicating that `num` is a prime number.
