Correctness: True

Explanation: The program defines a function that correctly determines whether a number is prime or not using the `is_prime` function. It then iterates through all numbers from 2 to n-1 and counts the prime numbers, returning the count in the end. The logic is sound and covers all possible cases, ensuring that the output is the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
