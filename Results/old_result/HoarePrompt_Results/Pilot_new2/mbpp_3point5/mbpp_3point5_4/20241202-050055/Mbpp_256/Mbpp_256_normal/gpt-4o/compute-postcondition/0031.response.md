Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values where `is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False` and all other elements are True, `i` is at least 3, `j` is the next value after the last iteration's `j` in the range `[i * i, n)` where `is_prime[j]` is False**
