Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes in a non-negative number `n` and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`. The program first initializes a list `is_prime` where all numbers are considered prime initially. Then, it marks 0 and 1 as non-prime. It iterates over the numbers up to the square root of `n` and marks the multiples of each number as non-prime. Finally, it returns the sum of the boolean values in the `is_prime` list, which represents the count of prime numbers less than `n`.

The program handles the cases where `n` is less than or equal to 2 by returning 0 because there are no prime numbers less than 2. For `n` greater than 2, it correctly calculates the count of prime numbers less than `n`.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the given problem description and is correct.
