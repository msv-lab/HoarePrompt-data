Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder, calculates the volume using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, and returns the volume. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which requires the function to return the volume of a cylinder given the radius and height. The program also specifies that the radius and height are non-negative numbers, which is consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
