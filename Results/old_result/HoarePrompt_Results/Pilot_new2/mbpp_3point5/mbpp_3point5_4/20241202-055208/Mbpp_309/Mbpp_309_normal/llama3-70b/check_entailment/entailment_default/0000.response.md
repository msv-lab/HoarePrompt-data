Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum value between them using the `max` function. The code perfectly aligns with the problem description as it accurately finds and returns the maximum of two numbers. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the code would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
