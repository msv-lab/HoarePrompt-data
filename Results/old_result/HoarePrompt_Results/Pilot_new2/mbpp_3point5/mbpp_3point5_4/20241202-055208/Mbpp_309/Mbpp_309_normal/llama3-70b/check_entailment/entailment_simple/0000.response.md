Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two integer arguments `a` and `b` and returns the maximum of the two numbers using the `max()` function in Python. This is exactly what the problem description asks for - finding the maximum of two numbers. The program will always return the correct maximum value between `a` and `b`, making it correct.
