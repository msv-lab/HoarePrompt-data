Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b` and returns the larger of the two integers. The code uses a simple ternary operator to check if `a` is greater than `b`, and if so, it returns `a`, otherwise, it returns `b`. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, which states that the function should return the maximum of the two numbers.

The code has been tested with multiple test cases, including positive, negative, and equal numbers, and in all cases, it correctly returns the maximum of the two numbers. Since the code meets the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints also confirm the functionality of the code, we can conclude that the code is correct.
