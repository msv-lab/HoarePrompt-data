Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function called func_1 that takes in a tuple 'tup' and an element 'elem'. It then uses the count method of tuples to count the occurrences of the element 'elem' in the tuple 'tup'. This implementation exactly matches the problem description, which asks for a function that counts the occurrences of a given element in a tuple. Therefore, the program is correct.
