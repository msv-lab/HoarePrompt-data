Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes in a tuple and an element, then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The `count` method returns the number of times the specified element appears in the tuple. This program directly addresses the problem description and accurately counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple. Since the program works as expected for all possible inputs, the correctness is true.
