Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, then it returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. The code directly aligns with the problem description and the function correctly implements the logic to count the occurrences of the given element in the tuple. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the code is functioning as expected and the description of the problem matches the implementation in the code. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
