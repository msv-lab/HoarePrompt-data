Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly takes in a tuple and an element, then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. The three test cases provided cover scenarios where the element is not present (returning 0), where the element appears multiple times (returning the correct count), and where the element appears at the beginning of the tuple (returning the correct count). Since the program works as described for all the potential cases and inputs, the correctness is true.
