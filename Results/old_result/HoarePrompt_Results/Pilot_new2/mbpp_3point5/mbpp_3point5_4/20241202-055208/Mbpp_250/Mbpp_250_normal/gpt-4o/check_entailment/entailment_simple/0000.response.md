Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` and an element as input. It then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the given element in the tuple. The program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. Therefore, the program is correct as it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
