Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and then correctly uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function that counts the occurrences of a given element in a tuple. The program consistently performs this task for all input tuples and elements, making it correct.
