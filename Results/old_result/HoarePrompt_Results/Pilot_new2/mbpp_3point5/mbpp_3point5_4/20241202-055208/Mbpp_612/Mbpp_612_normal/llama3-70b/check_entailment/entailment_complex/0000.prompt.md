You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function which takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list has the first element of each sublist and the second one has the second.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements.**
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [list(element[0] for element in list_of_lists), list(element[1] for
    element in list_of_lists)]
    #The program returns two lists. The first list contains the first elements of each sublist in list_of_lists, and the second list contains the second elements of each sublist in list_of_lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements. It returns two lists - one containing the first elements of each sublist in list_of_lists and the other containing the second elements of each sublist. The implementation correctly extracts the first and second elements from each sublist and returns them in separate lists.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
