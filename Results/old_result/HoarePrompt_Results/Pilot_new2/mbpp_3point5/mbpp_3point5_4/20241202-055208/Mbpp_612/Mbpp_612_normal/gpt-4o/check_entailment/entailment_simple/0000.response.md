Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function that takes a list of lists as input. It then correctly extracts the first and second elements of each sublist in the input list and returns a list containing these extracted elements in two separate lists. This matches the requirements stated in the problem description, making the program correct. The program always produces the desired output as it follows the instructions in the problem description for all potential cases.
