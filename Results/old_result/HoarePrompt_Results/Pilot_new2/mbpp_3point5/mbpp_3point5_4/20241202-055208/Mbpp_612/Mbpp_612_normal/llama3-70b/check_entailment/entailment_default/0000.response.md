Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input, where each sublist has exactly two elements. The function then extracts the first and second elements from each sublist and returns them in two separate lists. The implementation seems to align perfectly with the problem description, as it correctly handles the input format and extracts the elements as required. Additionally, the output hints provided also agree with the code, further confirming that the code is correct as it meets the specified requirements.
