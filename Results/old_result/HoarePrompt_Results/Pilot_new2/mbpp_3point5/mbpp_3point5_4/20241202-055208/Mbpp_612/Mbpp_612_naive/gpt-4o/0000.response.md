Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The function `func_1` takes a list of lists as input where each sublist has two elements. It then creates two separate lists, one containing the first element of each sublist and the other containing the second element of each sublist. The function then returns a list of these two lists.

All the provided test cases pass successfully and the function works as described in the problem description. The program handles the input correctly and produces the expected output for all potential cases.
