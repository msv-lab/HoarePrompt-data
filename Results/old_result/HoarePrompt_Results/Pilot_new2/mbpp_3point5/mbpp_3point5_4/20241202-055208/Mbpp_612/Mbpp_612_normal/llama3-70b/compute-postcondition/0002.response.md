Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements. It returns two lists - one containing the first elements of each sublist in list_of_lists and the other containing the second elements of each sublist. The implementation correctly extracts the first and second elements from each sublist and returns them in separate lists.**
