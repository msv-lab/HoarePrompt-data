Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a string `s` and returns a new string containing only the uppercase letters from the original string. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires the function to remove lowercase substrings from the given string. Since the program filters out lowercase letters and returns only the uppercase ones, it indeed fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
