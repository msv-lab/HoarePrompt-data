Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a number and returns its polar coordinates using the `cmath` module.
- The provided test cases assert that calling `func_1` with the inputs 1, 4, and 5 should return the polar coordinates (1.0, 0.0), (4.0, 0.0), and (5.0, 0.0) respectively.
- The code seems to follow the problem description and the output hints. The code is correctly converting the given complex numbers to polar coordinates and returning the expected results for the provided test cases.
- Additionally, the code is concise and utilizes the `cmath` module for accurate calculation of polar coordinates, which aligns with the problem description of converting complex numbers to polar coordinates.
