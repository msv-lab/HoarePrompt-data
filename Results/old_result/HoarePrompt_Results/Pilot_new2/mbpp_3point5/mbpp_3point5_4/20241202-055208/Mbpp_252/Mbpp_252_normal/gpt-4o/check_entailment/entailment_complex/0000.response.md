Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it follows the problem description by effectively converting complex numbers to polar coordinates using the cmath module. Since the program directly uses the cmath.polar function, it ensures that the conversion to polar coordinates is done accurately without the need for manual calculation. The function defined in the program matches the requirements specified in the problem description.
