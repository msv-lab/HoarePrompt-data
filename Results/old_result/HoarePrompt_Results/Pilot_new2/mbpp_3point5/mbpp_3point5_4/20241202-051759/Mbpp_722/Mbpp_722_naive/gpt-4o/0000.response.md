Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. It filters the students based on height and weight separately, but the problem description specifies that the filtering should be done based on both height and weight being above the minimum values. The current implementation filters based on either height or weight being above the minimum values, leading to incorrect results.

For example, if we call the function with the input:
```
func_1({'Cierra Vega': (6.2, 70), 'Alden Cantrell': (5.9, 65)}, 6.0, 70)
```
The expected output should be an empty dictionary since neither student's height is above 6.0 and weight is above 70. However, the current implementation would return:
```
{'Cierra Vega': (6.2, 70)}
```
as it only checks for height or weight individually.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases, making the Correctness **False**.
