Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the given problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a dictionary of student data, a minimum height, and a minimum weight, and filters the dictionary to return a new dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The code iterates through the student dictionary and includes only those students who meet the height and weight criteria. The code covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and the provided examples, ensuring that only students with both height and weight above the minimum values are included in the filtered dictionary.
