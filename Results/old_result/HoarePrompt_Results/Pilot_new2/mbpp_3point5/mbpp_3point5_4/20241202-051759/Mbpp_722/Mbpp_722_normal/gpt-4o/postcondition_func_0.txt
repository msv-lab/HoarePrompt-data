The function accepts a dictionary of student data, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It then filters the dictionary to return a new dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight. If any student data is missing height or weight information, it will not be included in the filtered dictionary.
