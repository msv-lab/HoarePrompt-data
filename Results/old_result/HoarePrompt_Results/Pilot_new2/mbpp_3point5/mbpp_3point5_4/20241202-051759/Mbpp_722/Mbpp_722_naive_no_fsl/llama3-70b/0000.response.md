Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in a dictionary of student data where the key is the student name and the value is a tuple of float values representing the student's height and weight. It filters out the students whose height and weight are both above the minimum values provided. The program iterates through the dictionary items and applies the filtering condition to each student, returning a new dictionary with only the students meeting the criteria. The logic seems correct and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
