Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and iterates over the elements of the tuple. It returns True as soon as it encounters a `None` value in the tuple, and False if no `None` value is found. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which states that the function should return True if the given tuple has any `None` value and False otherwise. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implemented and follows the problem description.
