Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks if the given tuple has any `None` value. It iterates through the tuple and as soon as it encounters a `None` value, it returns `True`. If there are no `None` values in the tuple, it returns `False`. This aligns with the problem description of checking if the given tuple has any `None` value. The program always returns the correct result based on the problem description.
