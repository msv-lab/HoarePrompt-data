Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple as input and checks if there is any `None` value in the tuple. It iterates through the tuple and returns `True` as soon as it encounters a `None` value. If no `None` value is found, it returns `False`. The program follows the problem description accurately as it correctly identifies the presence of a `None` value in the tuple. The program stops iterating as soon as it finds a `None` value, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
