Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly iterates over each item in the tuple `tup` and checks if any item is `None`. If it finds a `None` value, it returns `True`, indicating that there is a `None` value in the tuple. If it does not find any `None` value after iterating through all items, it returns `False`, indicating that there are no `None` values in the tuple. The given assertions also cover both cases where there are `None` values present and where there are no `None` values, and the function returns the expected output in both cases. So, the program is correct for this problem description.
