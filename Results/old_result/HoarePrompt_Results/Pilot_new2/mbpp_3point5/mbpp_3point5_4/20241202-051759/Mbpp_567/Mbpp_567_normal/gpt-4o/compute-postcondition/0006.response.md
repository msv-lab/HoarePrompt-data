Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1. The element at index `i` in `lst` is less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1`. If `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, then the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
