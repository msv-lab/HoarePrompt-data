Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly uses a list comprehension along with the `all` function to check if every element in the list is less than or equal to the next element, which is a valid way to determine if a list is sorted. The range used in the list comprehension ensures that the comparison is done between consecutive elements in the list.
