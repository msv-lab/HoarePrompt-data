According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `lst` - 1. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 1. The element at index `i` in `lst` is less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2, `i` is 2. The element at index `i` in `lst` is less than or equal to the element at index `i + 1`**
