Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a list of comparable elements and iterates through the list to check if there exists an index i such that lst[i] is greater than lst[i + 1]. If such an index is found, the function returns False; otherwise, it returns True. The function assumes the list has a length of at least 2.** 

The code does what the annotations say, covering the case where the function returns True if there is no such index i where lst[i] is greater than lst[i + 1]. However, it does not explicitly mention how the function behaves if the list has fewer than 2 elements. In such cases, the functionality should include that it does not perform the comparison and returns True.
