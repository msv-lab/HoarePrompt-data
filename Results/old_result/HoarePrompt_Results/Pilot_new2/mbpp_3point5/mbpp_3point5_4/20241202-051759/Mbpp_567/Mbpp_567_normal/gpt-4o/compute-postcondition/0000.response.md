According to the code, the loop can execute if the length of the list `lst` is at least 2. This is because `range(len(lst) - 1)` will generate values from 0 to len(lst) - 2, so the loop will not execute if the length is less than 2. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 0. 
State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2, `i` is 0**
