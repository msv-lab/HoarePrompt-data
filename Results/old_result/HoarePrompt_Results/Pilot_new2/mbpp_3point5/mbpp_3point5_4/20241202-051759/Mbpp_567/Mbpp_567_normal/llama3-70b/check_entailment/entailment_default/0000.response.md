Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and returns True if all elements in the list are in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns False. The code uses a list comprehension and the `all()` function to check if each element is less than or equal to the next element in the list, which aligns with the requirement of checking for non-decreasing order. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the description, as it correctly determines whether the list is sorted or not based on the specified condition. Additionally, there are no edge cases identified where the code does not meet the problem description.
