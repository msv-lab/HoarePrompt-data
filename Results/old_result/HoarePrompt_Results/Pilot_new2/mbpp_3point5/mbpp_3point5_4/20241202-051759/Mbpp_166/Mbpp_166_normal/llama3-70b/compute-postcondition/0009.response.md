According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the length of the `nums` list. Since `j` is ranging from `i + 1` to the length of `nums`, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than the length of `nums`.

At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 2, and the result of XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is an even number. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should remain the same, `j` should be incremented by 1, and since `j` should be less than the length of `nums`, the length of `nums` must be at least 3.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `count` is 2, `i` is 0, `j` is 3. The result of the XOR operation between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is an even number.**
