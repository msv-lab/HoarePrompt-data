According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the length of the nums list. If the nums list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. At the start, `count` is 0 does not play a role in determining if the loop will execute. So, for the loop to execute, `i` needs to be 0, `nums` must have at least 2 elements, and `j` should be 1.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 elements, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
