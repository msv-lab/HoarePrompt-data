Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `count` is the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number increased by 3 or increased by 1 if (nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0. `i` is 2, `j` is such that `j + 2 < len(nums)`***
