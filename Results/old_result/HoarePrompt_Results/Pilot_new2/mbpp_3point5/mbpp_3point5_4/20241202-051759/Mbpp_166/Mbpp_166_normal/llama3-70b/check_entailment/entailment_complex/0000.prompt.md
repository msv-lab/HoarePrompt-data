You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.**
def func_1(nums):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if (nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: `nums` is a list of integers, `count` is the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number, `i` is equal to `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is equal to `len(nums)`, the loop has finished executing. If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, `count` remains 0.
    return count
    #The program returns the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and calculates the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number. If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, the function returns 0.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
