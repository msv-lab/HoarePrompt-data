Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of integers as input and counts the number of pairs of integers in the list that XOR to an even number. This aligns with the problem description provided. The use of nested loops to iterate through all possible pairs of integers in the list and the XOR operation to check for even numbers is correct. The final count is returned as the output.

Overall, the program correctly implements the required functionality of counting pairs of integers that XOR to an even number in the input list, making it a correct solution.
