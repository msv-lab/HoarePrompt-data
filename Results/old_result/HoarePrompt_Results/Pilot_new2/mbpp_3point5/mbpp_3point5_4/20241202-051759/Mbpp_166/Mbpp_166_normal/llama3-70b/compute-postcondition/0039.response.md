The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. The program calculates the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number. The program then returns this count as the output.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number.**
