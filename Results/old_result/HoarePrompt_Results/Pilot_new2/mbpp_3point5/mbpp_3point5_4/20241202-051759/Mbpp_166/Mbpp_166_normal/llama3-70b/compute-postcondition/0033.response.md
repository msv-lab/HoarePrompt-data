According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j + 1` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 3 elements, `count` is the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number increased by 3, `i` is 2, `j` is such that `j + 1 < len(nums)`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` needs to be increased by 1 but still satisfy the condition `j + 1 < len(nums)`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `count` is the number of times the XOR operation between any pair of elements in `nums` results in an even number increased by 3, `i` is 2, `j` is such that `j + 2 < len(nums)`**
