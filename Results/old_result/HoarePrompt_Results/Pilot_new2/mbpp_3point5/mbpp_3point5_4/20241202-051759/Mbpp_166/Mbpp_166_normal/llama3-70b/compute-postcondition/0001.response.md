According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nums list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, count is 0. So for the loop to execute, the nums list must have at least 1 element, and i (index) is 0.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
