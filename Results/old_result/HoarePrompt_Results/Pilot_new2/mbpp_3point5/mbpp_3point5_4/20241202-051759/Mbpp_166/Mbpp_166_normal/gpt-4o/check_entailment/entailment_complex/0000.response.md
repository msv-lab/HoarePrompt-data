Correctness: **True**

The annotated program `func_1` correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number. It first calculates the counts of even and odd numbers in the list, and then calculates the number of pairs of even numbers and the number of pairs of odd numbers separately. Finally, it returns the sum of these counts. The program accounts for pairs of even and odd numbers separately and does not include pairs that consist of the same number, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
