Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly checks whether all the characters in the input string are the same or not. It iterates through each character in the string and compares it with the first character. If any character is found to be different, it immediately returns False. Otherwise, it returns True. The program has been tested with examples where all characters are the same and where there are different characters, and it produces the correct output in both cases. Hence, the program is correct.
