You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to remove first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string and ch is a single character string.**
def func_1(s, ch):
    first_index = s.find(ch)
    last_index = s.rfind(ch)
    if (first_index == -1 or last_index == -1 or first_index == last_index) :
        return s
        #The program returns the string `s`
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`. The `first_index` is not -1, `last_index` is not -1, and `first_index` is not equal to `last_index`.
    return s[:first_index] + s[first_index + 1:last_index] + s[last_index + 1:]
    #The program returns the string `s` with the characters between the first occurrence of `ch` and the last occurrence of `ch` (excluding both occurrences) removed.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes two parameters: a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. If the `ch` character is found in the string `s` and occurs more than once, the function returns the original string `s` with the characters between the first and last occurrence of `ch` (excluding both occurrences) removed. If `ch` is not found, or if it occurs only once, the function simply returns the original string `s`.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
