Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the problem description. While it does remove the characters between the first and last occurrence of the given character `c`, it does not remove the first and last occurrence themselves. This means that the program does not completely remove the first and last occurrence of the given character from the string. Therefore, the program does not fully satisfy the requirements of the problem description.
