Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it fails to remove the first and last occurrences of the given character if they are the same. For example:
```
assert func_1('racecar', 'r') == 'aceca'
```
The expected output should be 'aceca' after removing the first and last occurrences of 'r', but the actual output will be 'acecar' because the program does not handle the case where the first and last occurrences of the character are the same.
