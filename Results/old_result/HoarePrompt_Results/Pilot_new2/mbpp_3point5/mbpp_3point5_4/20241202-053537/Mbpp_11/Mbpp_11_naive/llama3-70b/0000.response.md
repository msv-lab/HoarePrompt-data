Correctness: **False**

The given program does not handle the case where the first and last occurrences of the given character are the same. In this case, it should remove only that single occurrence, but the current implementation will remove both occurrences. Here is a test case demonstrating this issue:

Example:
```
Input: s = "hello", c = "o"
Expected Output: "hell"
Actual Output: "helll"
```

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.
