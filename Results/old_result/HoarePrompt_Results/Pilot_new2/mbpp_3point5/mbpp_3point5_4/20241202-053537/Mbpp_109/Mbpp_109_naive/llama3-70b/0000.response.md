Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. It first extends the string `s` to ensure it's long enough to perform the rotations. Then, it iterates through each rotation and counts the number of '1's in the current substring, incrementing the count if the number of '1's is odd. This logic covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
