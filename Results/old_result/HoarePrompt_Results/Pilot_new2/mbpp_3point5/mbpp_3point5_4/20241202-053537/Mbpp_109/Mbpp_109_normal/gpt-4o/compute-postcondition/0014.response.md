Output State: **binary_str is the rotated version of the previous binary_str, num_rotations is greater than 2, count is adjusted based on the new integer_value, integer_value is the updated decimal representation of the new rotated binary_str, integer_value is the decimal representation of the new rotated binary_str. If integer_value % 2 == 1, count is increased by 1, integer_value is the decimal representation of the new binary_str, integer_value = int(binary_str, 2)**
