Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the function described in the problem description. The function takes a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, repeats the binary string `s` as necessary to match the length of `n`, counts the occurrences of '1' in each substring of length equal to the length of `s`, and updates the count based on whether the count of '1' in the substring is odd. Finally, the function returns the total count.

The program ensures that the binary string is repeated to match the length of `n`, then iterates through the string to calculate the count of '1' in each substring. The count is updated based on whether the count of '1' in the substring is odd. The final count is returned as the result.

Since the program follows the problem description and correctly implements the required functionality, the correctness is True.
