Functionality: The function func_1 takes two parameters, binary_str (a binary string consisting of only '0's and '1's) and num_rotations (a non-negative integer). It then rotates the binary string num_rotations times, calculates the decimal value of the rotated binary string, and increments a count if the decimal value is odd. Finally, it returns the total count of odd values obtained after the rotations. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in this summary.
