Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two lists `list1` and `list2` of the same length. It first checks if the lengths of both lists are equal, and if not, it raises a `ValueError` with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. If the lengths are equal, it then proceeds to return a new list generated by dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`.

This program meets the requirements of the problem description as it correctly divides two lists element wise only if they have the same length. If the lengths are not the same, it raises an error. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
