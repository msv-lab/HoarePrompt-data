Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two lists `list1` and `list2`, both of equal length containing integers or floating-point numbers. The function then uses a list comprehension to iterate through both lists simultaneously using `zip` and divides each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. This aligns with the problem description which states that the function should return a new list containing the result of dividing each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`.

Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description and achieves the desired functionality.
