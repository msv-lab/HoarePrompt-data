Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly checks if the two input lists are of the same length. If they are not of the same length, it raises a ValueError as specified in the problem description. 
If the lists are of the same length, the program then proceeds to divide the elements of the two lists element-wise using list comprehension and the `zip` function. 
Since the program checks for the length of the lists and correctly performs element-wise division when the lists are of the same length, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
