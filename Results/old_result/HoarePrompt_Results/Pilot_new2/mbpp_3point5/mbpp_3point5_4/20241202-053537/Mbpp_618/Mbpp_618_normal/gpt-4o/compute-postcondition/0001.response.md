The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of equal length containing integers or floating-point numbers. After executing the function body, the program returns a new list that contains the result of dividing each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of equal length containing integers or floating-point numbers, and return a new list containing the division result of each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, list1 and list2, both of equal length containing integers or floating-point numbers. It returns a new list containing the division result of each element in list1 by the corresponding element in list2.**
