The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers of the same length. After executing the function body, the program returns a new list generated by dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`. If the length of `list1` is not equal to the length of `list2`, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers of the same length, divide each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`, and return a new list. If the lengths of the input lists are not the same, it raises a ValueError. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of numbers of the same length, divides each element of list1 by the corresponding element of list2, and returns a new list. If the lengths of the input lists are not the same, it raises a ValueError.**
