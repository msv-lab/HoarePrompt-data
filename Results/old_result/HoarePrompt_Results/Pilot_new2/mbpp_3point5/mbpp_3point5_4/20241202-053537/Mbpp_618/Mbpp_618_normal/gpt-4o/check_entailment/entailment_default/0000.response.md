Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in two lists of equal length, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list containing the result of dividing each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. The code uses list comprehension along with the `zip` function to achieve this element-wise division, which aligns with the problem description. 

After analyzing the code and matching it with the problem description, we find that the code indeed follows the specified requirements. Additionally, the output hints also confirm that the function is correctly implemented based on the given description. We have verified the cases provided in the example assertions, and they all produce the expected output, further supporting the correctness of the code.
