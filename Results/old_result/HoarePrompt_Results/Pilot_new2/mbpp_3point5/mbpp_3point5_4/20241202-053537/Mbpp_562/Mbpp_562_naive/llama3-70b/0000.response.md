Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly finds the length of the longest sublist in the given list of sublists by using a generator expression to calculate the length of each sublist and then finding the maximum length. Since the program follows the problem description and works as expected for all potential cases (such as empty sublists, sublists with different lengths, etc.), the correctness is True.
