According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list_of_lists. If the list has at least 2 sublists, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, list_of_lists has at least 1 sublist, sublist is the first sublist in the list_of_lists. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be at least 2 sublists in the list_of_lists and sublist is the second sublist in the list_of_lists.
State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists that must have at least 2 sublists, sublist is the second sublist in the list_of_lists**
