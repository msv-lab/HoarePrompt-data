Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a parameter `lists`, which is a list of lists. It then uses a generator expression to iterate over each sublist in `lists` and return the length of the longest sublist using `max()`. This is exactly what the problem description asks for - finding the length of the longest sublist in the list of lists.

Additionally, the program handles the case where `lists` is empty by returning 0, which is also in line with the problem description. Therefore, the program meets all the requirements of the problem description.
