Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly finds the length of the longest sublist in a list of lists. It iterates through each sublist, compares the length of the current sublist with the current maximum length, and updates the max_length if necessary. The provided test cases also cover different scenarios such as sublists of varying lengths, and the program produces the expected output for each case. Hence, the program is correct.
