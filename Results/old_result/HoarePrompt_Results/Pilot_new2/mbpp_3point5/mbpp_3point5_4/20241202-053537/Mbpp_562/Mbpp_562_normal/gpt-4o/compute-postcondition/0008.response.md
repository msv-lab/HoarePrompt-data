According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list_of_lists. If the list has at least 3 sublists the loop executes again for the third time. At the end of the last iteration, list_of_lists has at least 2 sublists, sublist is the second sublist in the list_of_lists, max_length is the length of the second sublist. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list_of_lists must have at least 3 sublists, sublist should be the third sublist in the list_of_lists, and max_length should be the length of the third sublist.
State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists that must have at least 3 sublists, sublist is the third sublist in the list_of_lists, max_length is the length of the third sublist**
