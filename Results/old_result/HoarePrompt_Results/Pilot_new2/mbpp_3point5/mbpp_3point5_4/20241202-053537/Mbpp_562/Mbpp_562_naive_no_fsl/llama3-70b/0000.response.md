Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function that takes a list of sublists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist. The code iterates through each sublist in the input list and calculates the length of each sublist using a generator expression. Finally, it returns the maximum length found among all sublists. This implementation is correct as it accurately finds the length of the longest sublist in the input list.
