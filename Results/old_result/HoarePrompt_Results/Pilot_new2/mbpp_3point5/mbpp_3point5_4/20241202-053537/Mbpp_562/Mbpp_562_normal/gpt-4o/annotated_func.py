#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist may contain any type of elements.**
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_length = 0
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        if len(sublist) > max_length:
            max_length = len(sublist)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist's length is at least as long as the previous sublist, max_length is the length of the longest sublist in list_of_lists
    return max_length
    #The program returns the length of the longest sublist in the list_of_lists
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists containing elements of any type. It iterates through each sublist to find the length of the longest sublist and returns that length as the output. The function accurately determines the length of the longest sublist in the input list_of_lists.
