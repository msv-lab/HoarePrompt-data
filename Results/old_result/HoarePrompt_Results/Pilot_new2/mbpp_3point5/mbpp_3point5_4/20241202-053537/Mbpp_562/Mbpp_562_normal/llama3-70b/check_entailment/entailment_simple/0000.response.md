Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist in the input list. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to find the length of the longest sublist. The program achieves this by using a generator expression inside the max() function to find the length of each sublist and then returning the maximum length found.

Therefore, the program is correct as it meets the requirements stated in the problem description.
