Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `index` is 2, `value` is the third element in the list (not equal to `element`). If `value` is equal to `element`, the program returns True and sets `index` to 2. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `arr`, `index`, and `value`.***
