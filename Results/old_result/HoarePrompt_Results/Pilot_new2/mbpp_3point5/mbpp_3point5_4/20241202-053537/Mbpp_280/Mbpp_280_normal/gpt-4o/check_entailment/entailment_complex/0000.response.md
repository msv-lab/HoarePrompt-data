Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the function described in the problem statement. It takes in an array and an element, iterates through the array to find the element, and if found, returns True along with the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns False along with -1. The annotations provided also explain the program's behavior accurately.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
