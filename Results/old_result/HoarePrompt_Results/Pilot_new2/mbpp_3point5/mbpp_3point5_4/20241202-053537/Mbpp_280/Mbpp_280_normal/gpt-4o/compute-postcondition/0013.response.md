Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list `arr` consisting of elements of any data type and an `element` of any data type. It iterates through the list and if it finds the `element`, it returns True along with the index of the first occurrence of the `element` in the list. If the `element` is not found, the function returns False along with -1. The function does not return the value of the index as stated in the annotations for any case.
