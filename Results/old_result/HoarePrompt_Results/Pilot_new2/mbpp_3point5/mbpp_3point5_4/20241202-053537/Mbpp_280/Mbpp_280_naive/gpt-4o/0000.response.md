Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function iterates through the array and checks if the element is equal to the current value. If it finds a match, it returns a tuple with True indicating the element is in the array and the index of the element. If no match is found, it returns a tuple with False and -1. The program is correct as it follows the problem description for all the given test cases, successfully returning the expected output in each case.
