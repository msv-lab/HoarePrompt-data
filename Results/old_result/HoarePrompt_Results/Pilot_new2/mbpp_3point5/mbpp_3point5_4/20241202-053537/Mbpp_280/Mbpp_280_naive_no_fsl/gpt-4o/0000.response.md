Correctness: True

Explanation: The function iterates through the input array and checks if the given element is equal to any element in the array. If a match is found, it returns a tuple with True and the index position of the element. If no match is found, it returns a tuple with False and -1. The provided test cases cover scenarios where the element is present at different positions in the array, and the function correctly returns the expected output in each case. Hence, the function is correct for all potential cases.
