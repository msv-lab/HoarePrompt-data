The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list `arr` of elements and an element `elem` to be searched in the list. The function then performs the following:
- Case_1: Returns True and i when the first element x in the list arr is equal to elem.
- Case_2: Returns True and the value of i which is 1.
- Case_3: Returns True and the index i where the element elem is found in the list arr.
- Case_4: Returns False, -1 as the default values when the element 'elem' is not found in the list 'arr'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to search for the element `elem` in the list `arr` and return different values based on the results of the search.
