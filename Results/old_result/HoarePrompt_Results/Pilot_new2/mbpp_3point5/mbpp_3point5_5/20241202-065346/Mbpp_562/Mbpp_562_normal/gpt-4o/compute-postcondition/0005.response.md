According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list contains more sublists, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, *list_of_lists is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist. If the length of sublist is greater than max_length, then max_length is updated to the length of the sublist. Otherwise, no change is made to the variables. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least 2 sublists in the `list_of_lists`.
State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists**
