Correctness: True

Explanation: The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist. The program iterates through each sublist in the input list and compares the length of the sublist with the current maximum length. If the length of the sublist is greater than the current maximum length, it updates the maximum length. The program then returns the maximum length.

The program has been tested with multiple test cases, and in each case, it correctly identifies the length of the longest sublist. The logic of the program is sound and aligns with the problem description, making it correct for all potential cases.
