Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. The function iterates through each sublist in the `list_of_lists` and updates the `max_length` variable to store the length of the longest sublist encountered so far. Finally, it returns the value of `max_length`, which represents the length of the longest sublist in the `list_of_lists`.

The program accurately determines the length of the longest sublist within the provided `list_of_lists`, which aligns with the problem description. It iterates through each sublist and correctly identifies the length of the longest sublist, ensuring that the output is always the length of the longest sublist as required by the problem description.
