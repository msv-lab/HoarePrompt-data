Correctness: **True**

The program iterates through each sublist in the list_of_lists and checks if the length of the sublist is greater than the current max_length. If it is, then it updates max_length to be the length of that sublist. Finally, it returns the max_length, which represents the length of the longest sublist in the list_of_lists. Therefore, the program successfully finds the length of the longest sublist in the given list of lists, as required by the problem description.
