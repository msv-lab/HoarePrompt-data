Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided seems to follow the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` takes in an array `arr` and an element `elem`, then iterates through the list to find the first occurrence of `elem`. If `elem` is found, the function returns True along with the index of the element in the list. If `elem` is not found, it returns False and -1. The code covers cases where `elem` is found at different indices in the list. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that it meets the requirements of the problem description. Since no potential case was found where the code deviates from the problem description, we can conclude that the code is correct.
