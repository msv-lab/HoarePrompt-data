Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly iterates through the array using `enumerate` to check if the element is present in the array. It returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element. The assertions provided in the program also check for different input arrays and elements and the expected output for those cases, which the function handles correctly. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
