Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a list `arr` and an element `elem`. It then iterates through the list to find the first occurrence of `elem`. If `elem` is found, it returns True along with the index of the element in the list. If `elem` is not found, it returns False and -1. The function covers all cases as described in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
