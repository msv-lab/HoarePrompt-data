Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function that takes in an array `arr` and an element `elem`, then iterates through the array using `enumerate` to check if the element is present. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with a boolean `True` indicating that the element is in the array, along with the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with a boolean `False` indicating that the element is not in the array, along with index `-1`.

The program meets the requirements of the problem description as it correctly returns a tuple with the boolean value and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found) in all potential cases, including when the element is not found in the array. Hence, the program is correct.
