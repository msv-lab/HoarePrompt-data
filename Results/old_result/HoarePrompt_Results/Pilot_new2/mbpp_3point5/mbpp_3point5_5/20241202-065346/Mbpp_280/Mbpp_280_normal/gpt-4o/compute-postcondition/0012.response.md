The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of any data type, and `element`, which can be any data type. The function will return True and the index of the first occurrence of the specified `element` in the list `arr` if it is found. There are multiple cases:

Case_1: The function returns True and index 0 if the specified `element` is found at index 0 in the list `arr`.

Case_2: The function returns True and index 1 if the specified `element` is found at index 1 in the list `arr`.

Case_3: The function returns True and the index which is 2 if the specified `element` is found at index 2 in the list `arr`.

Case_4: If the specified `element` is not found in the list `arr`, the function will return False and -1 as the index. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to search for the specified `element` in the list `arr` and return True along with the index of the element if found, or False along with -1 if the element is not present in the list.
