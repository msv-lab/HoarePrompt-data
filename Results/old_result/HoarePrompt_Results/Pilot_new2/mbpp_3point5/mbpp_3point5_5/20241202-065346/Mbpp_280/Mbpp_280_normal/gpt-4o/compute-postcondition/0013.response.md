Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of any data type, and `element`, which can be any data type. It searches for the specified `element` in the list `arr` and returns True along with the index of the element if found. If the element is not present in the list, it returns False along with -1 as the index. The actual code provided does not fully match the annotations as it does not return `None` if the element is not found, but instead returns False and -1. The function does not cover cases where the specified `element` is found at index 0, 1, or 2 as mentioned in the annotations.
