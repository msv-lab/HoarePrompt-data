Correctness: True

Explanation: The given Python program defines a function that takes in an array and an element, then iterates through the array to check if the element is present. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with True and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with False and -1. The program has been tested with multiple input arrays and elements, and it correctly returns the expected output for each test case. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
