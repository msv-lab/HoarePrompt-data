According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, the element is the last element in the list. So for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 element and the index is 0 and value is the first element in the list.
State: **arr is a list that must have at least 1 element, element is the first element in the list, index is 0**
