#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a binary string and n is a non-negative integer.**
def func_1(s, n):
    s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        temp = s[i:i + len(s)]
        
        count += temp.count('1') % 2
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a binary string repeated to match the length of `n`, `count` is the remainder of the division of the total number of '1's in `s` by 2, `n` is greater than 0
    return count
    #The program returns the remainder of the division of the total number of '1's in the binary string `s` by 2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`. It repeats the binary string `s` to match the length of `n`, then calculates the total number of '1's in the repeated string and returns the remainder of dividing that total by 2.
