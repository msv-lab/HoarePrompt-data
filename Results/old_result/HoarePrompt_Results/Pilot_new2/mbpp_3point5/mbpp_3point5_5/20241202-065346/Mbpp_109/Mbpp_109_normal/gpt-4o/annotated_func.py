    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `binary_str` is a string representing a binary number where the last digit is moved to the beginning, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, and `count` is the number of times the integer value of `binary_str` is odd after all iterations of the loop have executed.
    return count
    #The program returns the number of times the integer value of `binary_str` is odd after all iterations of the loop have executed
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. `binary_str` is a string representing a binary number, and `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. The function rotates the binary string `binary_str` by moving the last digit to the beginning for the specified number of rotations. After all iterations, it counts the number of times the integer value of the rotated `binary_str` is odd and returns that count.
