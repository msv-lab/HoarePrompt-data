Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It takes a binary string and rotates it a given number of times. Then, it converts the rotated binary string to an integer and checks if the integer value is odd. If it is odd, it increments a count. Finally, the function returns the total count of the number of times the integer value of the rotated binary string is odd.

The program follows the problem description by correctly finding the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
