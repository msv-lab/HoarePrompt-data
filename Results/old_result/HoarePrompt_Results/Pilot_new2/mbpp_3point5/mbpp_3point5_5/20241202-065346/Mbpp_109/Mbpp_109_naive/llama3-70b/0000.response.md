Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly handles the problem description. It first ensures that the binary string is long enough to rotate the given number of times by repeating it. Then, it counts the number of '1's in each rotation and checks if it is odd or even. The count of odd '1's is then returned as the result. The program covers all potential cases and works as described in the problem statement.
