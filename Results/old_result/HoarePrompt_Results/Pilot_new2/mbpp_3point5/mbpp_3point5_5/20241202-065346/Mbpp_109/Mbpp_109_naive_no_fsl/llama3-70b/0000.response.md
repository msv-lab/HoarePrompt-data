Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes in a binary string `s` and an integer `n`, and calculates the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating the binary string `n` times. The program correctly handles the case where the string `s` needs to be repeated multiple times in order to rotate it `n` times. It then iterates through each rotation, counts the number of '1's in the substring, and adds to the count if it is odd. The program uses the modulo operator to determine if the count of '1's is odd, which is a correct approach. Additionally, the program returns the correct count of numbers with an odd value. Therefore, based on the problem description and the code logic, the program is correct for all potential cases.
