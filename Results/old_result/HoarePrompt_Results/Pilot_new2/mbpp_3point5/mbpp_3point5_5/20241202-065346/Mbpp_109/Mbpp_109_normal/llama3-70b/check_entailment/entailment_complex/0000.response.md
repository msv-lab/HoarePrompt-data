Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, then repeats the binary string `s` to match the length of `n`. It calculates the total number of '1's in the repeated string and returns the remainder of dividing that total by 2, which is the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating the binary string the given number of times. The program handles all cases as specified in the problem description and produces the correct output.
