Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly rotates the binary string the given number of times and counts the number of numbers with an odd value. The logic of rotating the binary string and converting it to an integer is implemented correctly. 
The assertions provided in the program test the function with different binary strings and numbers of rotations, and in each case, the expected output matches the actual output. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
