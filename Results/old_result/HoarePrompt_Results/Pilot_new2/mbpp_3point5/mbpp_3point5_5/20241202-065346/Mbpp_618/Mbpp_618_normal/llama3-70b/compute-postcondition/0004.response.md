The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers with the same length. After executing the function body, the program returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`. If the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are not equal, there is no change in the lists. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers with the same length, and return a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`. If the lengths of the input lists are not equal, the function returns the input lists as they are. 
Functionality: **Accepts two lists of numbers with the same length and returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in list1 by list2. If the lengths of the input lists are not equal, returns the input lists unchanged.**
