Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program checks if the length of both input lists is the same and raises a ValueError if they are not. Then, it divides the elements of the two lists element-wise using list comprehension and zip. This logic ensures that the function divides two lists element-wise only if they are of the same length, as required by the problem description. The program handles all potential cases where the two lists have the same length, making it correct.
