Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate through both lists simultaneously using `zip` and calculates the result of dividing each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. Finally, it returns a new list containing the results of these division operations.

This program meets the requirements of the problem description as it correctly divides two lists element-wise and returns the expected output. Therefore, the correctness is true.
