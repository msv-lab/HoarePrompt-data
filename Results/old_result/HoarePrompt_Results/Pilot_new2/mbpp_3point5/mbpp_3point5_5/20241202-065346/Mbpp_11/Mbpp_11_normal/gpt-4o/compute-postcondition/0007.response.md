Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `ch`, which is a single character string. If the character `ch` is not found in string `s`, or if `ch` is found only once in `s`, the function returns the original string `s`. Otherwise, the function returns a new string obtained by removing the characters at the positions of the first occurrence and last occurrence of `ch` in the original string `s`.**
