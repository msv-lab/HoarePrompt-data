Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number `c` as input and returns a tuple containing the absolute value (magnitude) of the complex number and its phase (angle) in polar coordinates. The program uses the `abs()` function to calculate the magnitude of the complex number and the `cmath.phase()` function to calculate the phase. This implementation correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases of converting complex numbers to polar coordinates.
