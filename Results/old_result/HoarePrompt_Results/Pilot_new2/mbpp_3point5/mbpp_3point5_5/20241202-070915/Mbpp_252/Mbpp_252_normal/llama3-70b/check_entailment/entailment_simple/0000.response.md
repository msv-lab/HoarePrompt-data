Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number `c` as input and returns the absolute value of the complex number using `abs()` function and the phase of the complex number using `cmath.phase()` function. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates, where the absolute value corresponds to the magnitude and the phase corresponds to the angle in polar coordinates. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
