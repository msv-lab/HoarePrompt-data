Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function named `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and then returns the number of occurrences of `element` in the tuple `tup`. The implementation uses the built-in `count` method of tuples, which accurately counts the occurrences of the specified `element` in the given `tup`. The code aligns perfectly with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not follow the specifications. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the code behaves as expected, further supporting the correctness of the program.
