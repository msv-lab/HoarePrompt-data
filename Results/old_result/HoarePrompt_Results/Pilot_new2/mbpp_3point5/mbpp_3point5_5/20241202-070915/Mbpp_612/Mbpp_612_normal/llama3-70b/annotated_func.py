#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list where each element is a sublist containing exactly two elements.**
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [list(element[0] for element in list_of_lists), list(element[1] for
    element in list_of_lists)]
    #The program returns two lists - the first list contains the first elements of each sublist in the list_of_lists, and the second list contains the second elements of each sublist in the list_of_lists.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, where each element is a sublist with exactly two elements. It then returns two lists - the first list containing the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the second list containing the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`.
