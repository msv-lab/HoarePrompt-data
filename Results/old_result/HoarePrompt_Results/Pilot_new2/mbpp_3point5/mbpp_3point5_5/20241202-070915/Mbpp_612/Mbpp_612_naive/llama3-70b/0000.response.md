Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The provided program correctly takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements and returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element. The program uses list comprehension to iterate over the input list_of_lists, extracting the first and second elements separately and returning them as separate lists. This logic correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases.
