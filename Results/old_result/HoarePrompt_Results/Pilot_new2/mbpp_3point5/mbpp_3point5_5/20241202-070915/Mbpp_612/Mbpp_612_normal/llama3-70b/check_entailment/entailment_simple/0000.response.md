Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The program is supposed to return a list of two lists where the first list contains the first elements of each sublist in the input list, and the second list contains the second elements of each sublist. 

However, in the provided program, the list comprehension is incorrectly used. The program returns two separate lists, each containing all the first and second elements of the sublists, respectively. This is not the desired output as per the problem description.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and is incorrect.
