Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to be correct as it follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The code achieves this by using list comprehension to extract the first and second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. There are no edge cases or scenarios provided in the problem description that are not handled by the code. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
