Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a Python function `func_1` that takes in two integer parameters `a` and `b`. The function then returns the greater integer between the two using the ternary operator. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to find the maximum of two numbers. The program handles all cases correctly, including when `a` is equal to `b`. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
