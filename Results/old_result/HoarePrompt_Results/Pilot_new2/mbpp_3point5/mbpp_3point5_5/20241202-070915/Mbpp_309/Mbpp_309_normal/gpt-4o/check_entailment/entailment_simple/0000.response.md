Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two integers `a` and `b` and returns the maximum of the two numbers. It uses a ternary operator to compare `a` and `b` and returns the greater of the two. This implementation aligns with the problem description of finding the maximum of two numbers. The program always returns the correct maximum value between the two integers provided as input.
