Correctness: **True**

The program meets the problem description as it removes all lowercase substrings from the given string and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters. The list comprehension `[char for char in s if char.isupper()]` filters out all lowercase characters from the original string 's' and only keeps the uppercase characters. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
