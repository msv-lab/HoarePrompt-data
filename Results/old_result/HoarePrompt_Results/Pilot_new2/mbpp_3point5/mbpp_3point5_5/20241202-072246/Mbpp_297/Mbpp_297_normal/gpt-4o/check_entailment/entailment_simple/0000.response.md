Correctness: **True**

The program correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes a nested list structure as input and flattens it by recursively calling itself on any nested lists within the structure. The program ensures that all elements are concatenated into a single flat list, as required by the problem description. The use of recursion helps in flattening any level of nested lists, ensuring that the output is always a flat list. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
