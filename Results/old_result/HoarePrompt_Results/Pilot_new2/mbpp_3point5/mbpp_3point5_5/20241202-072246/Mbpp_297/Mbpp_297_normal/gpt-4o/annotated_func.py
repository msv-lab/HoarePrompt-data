def func_1(nested_list):
    flat_list = []
    for item in nested_list:
        if isinstance(item, list):
            flat_list.extend(func_1(item))
        else:
            flat_list.append(item)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: nested_list is a nested list structure containing integers or other nested lists. If any item is a list, flat_list is a list containing all the elements flattened with func_1 applied to each nested list. If any item is not a list, flat_list contains all items flattened, including those returned from func_1.
    return flat_list
    #The program returns flat_list which contains all elements flattened with func_1 applied to each nested list in the nested_list structure. If any item is not a list, flat_list contains all items flattened, including those returned from func_1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`, which is a nested list structure containing integers or other nested lists. The function recursively flattens the nested list structure by applying `func_1` to each nested list within it. It returns `flat_list`, which contains all elements flattened with `func_1` applied. In cases where an item in the nested list is not a list, `flat_list` includes all items flattened, including those returned from `func_1`. The function effectively flattens nested lists and returns a single flat list.
