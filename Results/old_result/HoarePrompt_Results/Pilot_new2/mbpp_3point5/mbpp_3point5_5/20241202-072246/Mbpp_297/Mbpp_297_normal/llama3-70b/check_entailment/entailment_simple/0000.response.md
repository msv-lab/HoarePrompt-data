Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened version of that list. The program recursively flattens the nested list structure by checking each element in the list. If the element is a list itself, the function recursively calls itself on that element. If the element is not a list, it appends that element to the `flat_list`.

This program follows the problem description accurately by flattening any nested list structure provided as input. The recursion ensures that all nested lists are properly flattened, and the final `flat_list` contains all the elements of the original nested list structure in a flattened form. Hence, the program meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
