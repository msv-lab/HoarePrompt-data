According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 2 items, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a nested list structure containing integers or other nested lists that must have at least 1 item. If the item is a list, flat_list is a list containing the elements returned by func_1(item) and item is the first item in the nested_list. If the item is not a list, flat_list contains the first item from nested_list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the nested_list must have at least 2 items, and the flat_list should be updated accordingly. If the second item in the nested_list is a list, the flat_list should contain elements returned by func_1(second_item), and the item should be the second item in the nested_list. If the second item is not a list, then flat_list should contain the second item itself, and item should be the second item in the nested_list.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure containing integers or other nested lists that must have at least 2 items. If the second item is a list, flat_list is a list containing the elements returned by func_1(second_item) and item is the second item in the nested_list. If the second item is not a list, flat_list contains the second item from nested_list**.
