Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes two lists as input, finds the difference between the two lists using `symmetric_difference` which returns elements that are present in only one of the sets. The function then converts the resulting set back to a list, sorts the list based on the index of the element in the concatenated input lists, and returns the sorted list.

The provided test cases cover various scenarios where the function should work correctly. The function handles the cases where one list is a subset of the other or when both lists have completely different elements. The function also correctly sorts the output list based on the order of appearance in the input lists. Since the function passes all the given test cases and the logic follows the problem description, the correctness of the program is True.
