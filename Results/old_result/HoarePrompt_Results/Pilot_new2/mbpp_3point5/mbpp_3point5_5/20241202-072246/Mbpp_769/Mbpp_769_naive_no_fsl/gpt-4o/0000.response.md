Correctness: False

The provided program is incorrect because it does not accurately compute the difference between two lists. The error occurs in the line where the `result_list` is being sorted based on the index of elements in the concatenated `list1` and `list2`.

For example, consider the input:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1]) == [2, 3, 6, 7]
```

The expected output should be `[2, 3, 6, 7]` as the difference between `[1, 2, 3]` and `[6, 7, 1]`, but the code returns `[2, 3, 1, 6, 7]` due to incorrect sorting based on the concatenated list.

Therefore, the program is incorrect.
