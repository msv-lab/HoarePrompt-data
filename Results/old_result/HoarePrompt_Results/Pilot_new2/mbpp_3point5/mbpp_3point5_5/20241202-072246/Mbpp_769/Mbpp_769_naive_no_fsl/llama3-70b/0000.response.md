Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly uses the symmetric difference operator (^) between two sets created from the input lists to get the elements that are unique to each list. The program then sorts the resulting list before returning it. This logic covers all potential cases and meets the requirements of getting the difference between two lists. No specific case has been identified where the program does not work as expected.
