Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code iterates through the elements of the tuple `tup` and returns the index of the first tuple found in `tup`. If no tuple is found, it returns the length of the tuple `tup`. This logic follows the problem description accurately. The code correctly handles the case where it returns the index of the first tuple found in `tup` and also handles the case where no tuple is present in the tuple. The output hints also align with the code, confirming that it is correct.
