According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tup. If the tuple has at least 2 elements the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, tup has at least 1 element, and elem is not an instance of tuple or elem is not present in tup. So for the loop to be executed one more time the tuple must have at least 2 elements and elem is present in tup.
State: **`tup` is a tuple that must have at least 2 elements, `elem` is an instance of tuple and `elem` is present in `tup`**
