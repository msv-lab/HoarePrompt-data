Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the function `func_1` as described in the problem statement. It iterates over the elements of the tuple `tup` until it encounters a tuple element, at which point it stops counting and returns the total count of elements encountered so far. The code handles cases where there are no tuple elements in the tuple `tup` by continuing to count all elements in the tuple. The examples given in the problem description are covered by the code and it follows the problem description for all potential cases. Therefore, the code is correct.
