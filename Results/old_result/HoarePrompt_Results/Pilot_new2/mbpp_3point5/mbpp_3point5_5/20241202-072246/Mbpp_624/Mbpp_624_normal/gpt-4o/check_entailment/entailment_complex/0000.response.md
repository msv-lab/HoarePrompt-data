Correctness: **True**

The program defined in the annotated code correctly implements the problem description. It takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of that string using the `upper()` method in Python. This aligns perfectly with the requirement of converting a given string to uppercase. Therefore, the program is correct.
