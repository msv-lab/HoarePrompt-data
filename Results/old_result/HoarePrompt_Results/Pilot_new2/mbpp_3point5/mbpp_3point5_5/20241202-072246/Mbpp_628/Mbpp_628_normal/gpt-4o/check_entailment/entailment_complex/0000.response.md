Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes an input string and replaces all spaces with '%20' using the `replace` method. This directly aligns with the problem description which asks for a function to replace all spaces in a given string with '%20'. Since the program performs this task correctly for all potential cases, it meets the requirements of the problem description.
