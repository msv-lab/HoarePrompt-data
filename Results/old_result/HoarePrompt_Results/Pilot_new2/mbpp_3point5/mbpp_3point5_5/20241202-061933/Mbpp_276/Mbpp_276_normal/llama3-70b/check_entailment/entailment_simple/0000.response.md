Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function called `func_1` that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder, and calculates the volume of the cylinder correctly using the formula `Ï€ * radius ** 2 * height`. This aligns with the problem description which asks for a function to return the volume of a cylinder given its radius and height. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
