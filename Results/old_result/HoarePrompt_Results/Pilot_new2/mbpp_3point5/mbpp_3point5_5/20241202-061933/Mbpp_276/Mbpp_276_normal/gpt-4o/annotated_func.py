#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative numbers.**
def func_1(radius, height):
    volume = math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    return volume
    #The program returns the volume calculated as math.pi * radius squared times height, where radius and height are non-negative numbers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two non-negative numbers, `radius` and `height`, calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `math.pi * radius squared * height`, and returns the calculated volume. It is assumed that the parameters provided are valid non-negative numbers.
