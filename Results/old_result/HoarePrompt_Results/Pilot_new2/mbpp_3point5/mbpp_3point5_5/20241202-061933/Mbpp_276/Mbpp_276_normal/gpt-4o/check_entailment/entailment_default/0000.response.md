Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code matches the problem description accurately. The function `func_1` takes in two non-negative numbers, `radius` and `height`, and correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `math.pi * radius squared * height`. The code includes test cases with different input values for `radius` and `height`, and all the calculated volumes are close to the expected values within the specified tolerance. Additionally, the output hints align with the code and confirm that the function is correctly implemented according to the problem description.
