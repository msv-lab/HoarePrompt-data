Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` returns the last digit of the factorial of the given number `n` by covering all possible cases. It returns either the value of `n` itself if `n` is less than 4, or the integer 4 if `n` equals 4. This aligns with the requirement of finding the last digit in the factorial of a given number. Hence, the program is correct.
