Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it only returns 0 if the input number is greater than or equal to 5, which does not match the problem description of finding the last digit in the factorial of a given number. The assertions provided in the program are also incorrect as they do not match the problem description. For example, func_1(4) should return the last digit in the factorial of 4 which is 4, but the program incorrectly returns 4 without calculating the factorial.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
