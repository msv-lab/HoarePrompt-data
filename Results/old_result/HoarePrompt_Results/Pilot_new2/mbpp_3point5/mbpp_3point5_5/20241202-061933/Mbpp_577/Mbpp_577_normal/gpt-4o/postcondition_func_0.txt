The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. 
Case_1: If `n` is any non-negative integer, the function returns 0.
Case_2: If `n` is a non-negative integer between 1 and 5 inclusive, the function calculates the product of all numbers from 1 up to `n`, multiplies it by `(n+1)`, and returns the last digit of this result. 
The functionality does not cover the case when `n` is greater than 5, and there is no specific handling for that scenario.
