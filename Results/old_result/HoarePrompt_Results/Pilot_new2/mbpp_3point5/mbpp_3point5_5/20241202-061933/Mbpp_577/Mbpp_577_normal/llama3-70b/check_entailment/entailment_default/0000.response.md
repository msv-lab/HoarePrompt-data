Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not accurately follow the problem description for all potential cases. The description states that the function should find the last digit in the factorial of a given number, but the provided code does not calculate the factorial at all. Instead, it simply returns a fixed value based on the input `n`. For example, for `n = 5`, the code should return `0` since the last digit of 5! is 0. This discrepancy between the problem description and the code logic makes the code incorrect.
