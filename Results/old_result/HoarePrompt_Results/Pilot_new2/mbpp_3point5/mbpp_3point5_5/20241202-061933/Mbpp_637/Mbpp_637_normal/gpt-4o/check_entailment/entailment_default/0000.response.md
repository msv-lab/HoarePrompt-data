Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the function `func_1` which accepts two non-negative integer parameters `cost_price` and `selling_price`. It returns True if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`, otherwise it returns False. The provided test cases also align with the problem description and the function's logic. Since the code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints are in agreement with the code, the correctness is determined to be True.
