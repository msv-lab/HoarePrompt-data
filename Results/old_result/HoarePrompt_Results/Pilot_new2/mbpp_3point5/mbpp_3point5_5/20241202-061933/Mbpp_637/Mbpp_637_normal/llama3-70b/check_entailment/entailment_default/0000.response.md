Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code snippet provided defines a function `func_1` that takes two non-negative integer parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns True if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`, otherwise it returns False. The code follows the problem description for every potential case. The function simply checks if the cost price is equal to the selling price, which perfectly aligns with the problem statement. Since the code handles all possible cases correctly, the correctness of the code is True.
