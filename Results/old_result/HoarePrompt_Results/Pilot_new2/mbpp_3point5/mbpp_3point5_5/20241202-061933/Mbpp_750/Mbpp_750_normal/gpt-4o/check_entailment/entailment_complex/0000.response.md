Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, then concatenates the elements of the tuple `tpl` to the list `lst` using the `+` operator and the `list()` function. This results in a new list that contains all the elements of the original list `lst` followed by all the elements of the tuple `tpl`, as required by the problem description. The program does exactly what the problem description asks for in all cases.
