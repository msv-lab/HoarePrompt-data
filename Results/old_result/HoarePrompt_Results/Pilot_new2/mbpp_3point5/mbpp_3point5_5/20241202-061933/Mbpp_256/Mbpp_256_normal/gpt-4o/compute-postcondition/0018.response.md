According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, and all `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are now False. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. Since `i` is 3 and `j` is being incremented by `i` in the loop, the next value of `j` would be 12. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`, which means `n` must be greater than or equal to 12.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 12, `is_prime` is a list of booleans with `False` values at index 0 and 1, and `True` values for the rest of the indices representing numbers from 2 to `n-1`, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, and all `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are now False**.
