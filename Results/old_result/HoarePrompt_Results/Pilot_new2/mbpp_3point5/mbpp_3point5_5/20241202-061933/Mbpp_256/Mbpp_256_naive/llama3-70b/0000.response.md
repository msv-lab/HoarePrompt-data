Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: 
The given Python program defines a function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given number. The program uses a nested function `is_prime(num: int) -> bool` to check if a number is prime. The outer function then iterates through numbers from 2 to n and counts the prime numbers.

The program correctly identifies prime numbers using the `is_prime` function, which checks for divisibility up to the square root of the number. The program iterates through numbers from 2 to n (excluding n) and correctly counts the prime numbers less than n.

For all potential cases, the program follows the problem description and returns the expected count of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. Hence, the correctness of the program is true.
