Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. The program handles the case where the input number is less than or equal to 2, returning 0 as specified. For inputs greater than 2, it generates a list `is_prime` where each index represents a number from 2 to n-1, marking non-prime numbers as False and prime numbers as True. It then returns the sum of the True values in the list, which corresponds to the number of prime numbers less than the input number.

The program has been clearly annotated, explaining the state of the program at different points and what each block of code is doing. Overall, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output.
