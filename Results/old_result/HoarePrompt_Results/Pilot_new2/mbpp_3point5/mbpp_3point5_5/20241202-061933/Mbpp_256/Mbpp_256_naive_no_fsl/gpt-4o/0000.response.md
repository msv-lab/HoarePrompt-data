Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function that correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. It iterates over all numbers up to the square root of the input number and marks the multiples of each number as not prime. The program then returns the sum of the remaining numbers in the `is_prime` list, which are the prime numbers less than the given number. The provided test cases (5, 10, 100) all return the expected values and the logic of the program is sound, making the program correct.
