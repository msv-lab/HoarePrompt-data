According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and the values of `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[i*i, n)`.

1. The loop will execute if `n` is greater than `i*i`, so `n` must be greater than or equal to `i*i`.
2. The loop will execute if the values of `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[i*i, n)` are True. Since all `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are now False, they need to be adjusted to True for the loop to execute.
3. `i` is set to 4, which is not a condition for the loop to execute, so it does not need to be adjusted.
4. `j` is set to `n^2`, which is used to define the range of `j` in the loop, so it does not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i*i`, `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are True**
