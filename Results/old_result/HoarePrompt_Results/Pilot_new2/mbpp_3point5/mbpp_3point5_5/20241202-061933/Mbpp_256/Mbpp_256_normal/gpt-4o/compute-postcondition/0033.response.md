Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 16, `is_prime` is a list of booleans with `False` values at index 0 and 1, and `True` values for the rest of the indices representing numbers from 2 to `n-1`. All non-prime numbers in the range of 2 to `n-1` have been marked as False in the `is_prime` list.**
