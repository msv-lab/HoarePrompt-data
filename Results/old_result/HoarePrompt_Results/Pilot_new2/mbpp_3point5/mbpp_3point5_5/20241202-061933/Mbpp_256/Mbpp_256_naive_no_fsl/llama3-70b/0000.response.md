Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function to check if a number is prime or not, and then iterates through all numbers from 2 to n-1 to count the prime numbers. The logic in the code correctly handles the prime number calculation by using the `is_prime` function and counting the prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n`. The code covers all potential cases and works as expected.
