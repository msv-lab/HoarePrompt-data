According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `n`, which means the loop has already executed for all values within the range. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to the next value.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of booleans with `False` values at index 0 and 1, and `True` values for the rest of the indices representing numbers from 2 to `n-1`, `i` is `n+1`, `j` is `n^2`, and all `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are now False**
