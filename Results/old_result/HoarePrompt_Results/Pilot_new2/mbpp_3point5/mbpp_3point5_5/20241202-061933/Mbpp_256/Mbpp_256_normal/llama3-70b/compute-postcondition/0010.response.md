According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `i` is less than `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer and greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 3. Since `num` is not divisible by 2, the loop will continue. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer and greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 4. `num` is not divisible by 2. If `num` is divisible by 3, the function returns False.**
