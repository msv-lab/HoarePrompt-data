According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `[i * i, n)`.

Given the previous state:
- At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 12.
- `is_prime` is a list of booleans with `False` values at index 0 and 1, and `True` values for the rest of the indices representing numbers from 2 to `n-1`.
- `i` is 3.
- `j` is 12, and all `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are now False.

To execute the loop one more time:
- The new value of `j` should be within the range `[i * i, n)`.
- Since `i` is 3, the next value of `j` should be within `[3 * 3, n)` which simplifies to `[9, n)`.
- Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the new value of `j` must be 12 + 1 = 13.

Adjust the state:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 12, `is_prime` is a list of booleans with `False` values at index 0 and 1, and `True` values for the rest of the indices representing numbers from 2 to `n-1`, `i` is 3, `j` is 13, and all `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are now False**.
