According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `j < n` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and satisfies the condition `is_prime[i]`, `j` is 4. In this case, `j` is increased by `i` which is 2 so the next value of `j` will be 6. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`, so `n` must be greater than 6.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than 6, `is_prime` is a list of booleans with `False` values at index 0 and 1, and `True` values for the rest of the indices representing numbers from 2 to `n-1`, `i` is 2 and satisfies the condition `is_prime[i]`, `j` is 6**
