Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 16, `is_prime` is a list of booleans with `False` values at index 0 and 1, and `True` values for the rest of the indices representing numbers from 2 to `n-1`, `i` is 4, `j` is `n^2`, all `is_prime[j]` for `j` in the range `[n^2, n)` are now False, and if `is_prime[i]` is True, then `is_prime[i]` remains True, otherwise no change is made.***
