Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. For `n` greater than 2, the function generates a list `is_prime` where False represents non-prime numbers and True represents prime numbers from 2 to `n-1`. Then, the function returns the sum of all boolean values in the list `is_prime`. It does not handle the case where `n` is equal to 1, which can lead to incorrect results.
