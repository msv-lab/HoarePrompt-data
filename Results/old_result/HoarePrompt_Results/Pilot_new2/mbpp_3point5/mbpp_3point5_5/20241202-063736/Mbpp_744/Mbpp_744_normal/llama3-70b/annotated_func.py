#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    return any(x is None for x in tup)
    #The program returns True if there is any element in the tuple 'tup' that is None, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a tuple `tup` and returns True if there is any element in the tuple that is None. Otherwise, it returns False.
