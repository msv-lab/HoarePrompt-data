Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. The program uses list comprehension and the `all()` function to check if all elements in the list `lst` are in non-decreasing order by comparing each element with the next one.

The program meets the requirements of the problem description as it correctly checks if the list is sorted or not. It returns `True` if all elements are in non-decreasing order, and `False` otherwise. The annotation also clearly states the purpose of the function, which is to check if the elements in the list are in non-decreasing order.
