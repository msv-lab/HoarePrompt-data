Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order or not. The function iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If any element is greater than the following element, the function immediately returns False. If all elements maintain non-decreasing order, the function returns True.

The annotations also explain that the function correctly handles the case where the list has at least 2 elements, ensuring that it checks the order of elements properly.

Therefore, the program aligns with the problem description and always performs the required task of checking whether the input list is sorted or not.
