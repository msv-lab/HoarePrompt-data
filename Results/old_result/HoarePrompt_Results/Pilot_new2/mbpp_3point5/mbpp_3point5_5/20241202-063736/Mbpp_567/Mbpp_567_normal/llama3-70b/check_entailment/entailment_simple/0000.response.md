Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input. It then uses a list comprehension along with the `all()` function to check if every element in the list is less than or equal to the next element. This effectively checks if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The program returns True if all elements in the list `lst` are in non-decreasing order, and False otherwise, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
