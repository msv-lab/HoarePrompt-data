Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` is incorrect because it only checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element, which does not guarantee that the list is sorted. For example, the list [1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20] would incorrectly return `True` as per the current implementation, but it is not sorted.
