According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If the index `i` is less than the length of the list - 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the index `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, for the next iteration, the index `i` should be 2.
State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 2**
