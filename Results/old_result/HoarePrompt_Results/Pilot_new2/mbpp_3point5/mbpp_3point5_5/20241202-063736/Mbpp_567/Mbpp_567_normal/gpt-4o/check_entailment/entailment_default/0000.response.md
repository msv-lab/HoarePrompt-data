Correctness: **True**

Upon analyzing the code and the problem description, we can see that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order or not. The code iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one. If any element is greater than the following element, the function returns False, indicating that the list is not sorted. If all elements maintain non-decreasing order, the function returns True, signifying that the list is sorted. The function also handles cases where the input list has at least 2 elements, ensuring that it can accurately determine the order of elements in the list. Additionally, the provided examples match the expected behavior of the function based on the problem description, further confirming its correctness.
