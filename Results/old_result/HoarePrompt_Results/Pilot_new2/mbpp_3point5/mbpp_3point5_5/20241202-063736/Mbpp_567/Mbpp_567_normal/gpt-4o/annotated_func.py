#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of comparable elements.**
def func_1(lst):
    for i in range(len(lst) - 1):
        if lst[i] > lst[i + 1]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If the loop executes, it means that the elements of the list `lst` are in non-decreasing order. Therefore, the loop will not return False at any point. `lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements. `i` is len(lst) - 2
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of comparable elements. The function iterates through the list and checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element. If any element is greater than the following element, the function returns False. If all elements maintain non-decreasing order, the function returns True. The function handles the case where `lst` has at least 2 elements and correctly determines the order of elements in the list.
