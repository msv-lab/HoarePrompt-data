Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and checks if all characters in the string are the same by converting the string into a set to remove duplicates and then checking if the length of the set is equal to 1. If the length is 1, then all characters are the same, and it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

The program follows the problem description accurately as it correctly checks whether all characters in the string are the same or not. It returns True only if all characters are the same and False otherwise. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
