Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether all characters in the given string are the same or not. It first checks if the string is empty, in which case it returns True. Then, it initializes the variable `first_char` with the first character of the string and iterates through all characters in the string. If any character is not equal to `first_char`, it immediately returns False, indicating that not all characters are the same. If the loop completes without returning False, it means all characters in the string are the same, and it returns True. The program follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases.
