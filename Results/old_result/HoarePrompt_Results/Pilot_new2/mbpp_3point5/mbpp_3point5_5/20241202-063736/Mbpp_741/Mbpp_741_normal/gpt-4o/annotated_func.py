#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *s is a string. s is not an empty string.
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If the loop executes, then the string s consists of all characters being equal. If the loop does not execute, then the string s is empty or consists of only the first character.
    return True
    #The program returns True
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. The function checks if the string is empty or consists of all characters being equal. If the string is empty or has all equal characters, it returns True. If the string has different characters, it returns False.
