According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. If `char` is the first character of `s`, it means that the loop has finished iterating over all characters in `s`. To execute the loop one more time, the string `s` must have at least 2 characters.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least 2 characters, `char` is the second character of `s`, and `char` is equal to `second_char`**
