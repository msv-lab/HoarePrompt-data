Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function that filters out students from a dictionary based on their height and weight being above the minimum values provided. The function iterates over the items in the dictionary, checks if both height and weight are greater than or equal to the minimum values, and then creates a new dictionary with the filtered students.

All the provided test cases pass and demonstrate that the function correctly filters out students based on the given minimum height and weight requirements. The function handles all potential cases and works as expected according to the problem description.
