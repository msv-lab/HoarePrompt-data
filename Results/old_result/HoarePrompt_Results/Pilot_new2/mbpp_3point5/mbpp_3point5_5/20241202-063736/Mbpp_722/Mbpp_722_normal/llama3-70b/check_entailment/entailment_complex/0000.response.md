Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it follows the problem description. It takes in a dictionary `student_data`, along with `min_height` and `min_weight`, and filters the student data based on the condition that both the height and weight of the students are greater than or equal to `min_height` and `min_weight` respectively. It then returns a dictionary containing only the student names and corresponding tuples of height and weight that meet the specified criteria. The program achieves this by using dictionary comprehension to iterate over the items in the `student_data` dictionary, checking if both the height and weight are above the minimum values. This ensures that it only includes the students that meet the height and weight criteria in the final output.
