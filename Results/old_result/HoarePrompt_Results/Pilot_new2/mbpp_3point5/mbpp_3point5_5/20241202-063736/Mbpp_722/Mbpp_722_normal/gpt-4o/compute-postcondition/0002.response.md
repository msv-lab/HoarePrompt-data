Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a dictionary `student_dict` with student names as keys and height, weight tuples as values, along with minimum height `min_height` and minimum weight `min_weight`. It then returns a new dictionary with student names as keys and their corresponding height and weight tuples as values, only including students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`.** 

Note: The code correctly filters out students based on height and weight criteria as described in the annotations. However, an important edge case to consider is when the input dictionary `student_dict` is empty, in which case the function would return an empty dictionary. This edge case is not explicitly mentioned in the annotations but should be considered for a comprehensive understanding of the function's behavior.
