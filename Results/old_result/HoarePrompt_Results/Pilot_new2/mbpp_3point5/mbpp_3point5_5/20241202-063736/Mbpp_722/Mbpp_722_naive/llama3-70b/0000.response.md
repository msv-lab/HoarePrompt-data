Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly filters out students whose height and weight are both above the minimum values specified. It iterates over the dictionary of student data, checks each student's height and weight against the minimum values, and only includes students who meet the criteria in the final result. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
