Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary `student_dict`, a minimum height `min_height`, and a minimum weight `min_weight`. It then filters the dictionary based on the condition that both the height and weight of the student are greater than or equal to the minimum height and minimum weight respectively. The program correctly returns a new dictionary with only the students that meet these criteria.

The program adheres to the problem description as it filters out students based on both height and weight being above the minimum values provided. Hence, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
