Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than `i + 1`, `count` is the total number of pairs where the XOR results in an even number, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to the new value of `i` plus 1. If the XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, the total count of pairs with even XOR is increased by 1.***
