The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. The program calculates the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs, where even_pairs is the product of even_count and (even_count - 1) divided by 2, and odd_pairs is the product of odd_count and (odd_count - 1) divided by 2. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return the sum of the calculated even_pairs and odd_pairs. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers `lst` and returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs based on the given formula.**
