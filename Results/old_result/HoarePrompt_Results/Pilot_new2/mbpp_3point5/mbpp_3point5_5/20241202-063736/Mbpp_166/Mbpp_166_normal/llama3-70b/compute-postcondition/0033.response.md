According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with length greater than `i + 2`, and `count` is the total number of pairs where the XOR results in an even number. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` is incremented by 1, and now `j` is equal to the new value of `i` plus 2.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than `i + 3`, `count` is the total number of pairs where the XOR results in an even number, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to the new value of `i` plus 2**
