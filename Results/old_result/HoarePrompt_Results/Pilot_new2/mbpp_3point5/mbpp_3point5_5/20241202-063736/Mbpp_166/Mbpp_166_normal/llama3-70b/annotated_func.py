    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of integers, `count` is the total number of pairs where the XOR results in an even number. The loop will execute for all valid pairs of indices i and j in the `nums` list, and the count will be updated accordingly.
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of pairs where the XOR results in an even number in the `nums` list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a list of integers `nums` and calculates the total number of pairs where the XOR operation between the pair of numbers results in an even number. It iterates through all valid pairs of indices in the `nums` list and updates the count accordingly. The function then returns the final count of such pairs.
