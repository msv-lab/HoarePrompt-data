Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The program does not handle the case of an empty list. If the input list is empty, the program will result in a ZeroDivisionError as it tries to calculate the even_pairs and odd_pairs without checking if the list is empty.
- The program also does not consider the case where the input list contains only one type of integer (either all even or all odd). In this case, the calculation of pairs may not be accurate. 

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is therefore incorrect.
