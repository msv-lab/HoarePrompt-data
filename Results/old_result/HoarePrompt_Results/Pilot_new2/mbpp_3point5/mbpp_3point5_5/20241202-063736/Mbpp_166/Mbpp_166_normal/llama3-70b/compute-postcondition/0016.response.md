Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 0. `count` has been incremented by 1. `count` is the total number of pairs (i, j) where i is less than the length of `nums` and j is greater than i such that the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number. `i` is less than the length of `nums`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`. Additionally, after entering the if condition (((nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0)), the current state of the program variables is as described.**
