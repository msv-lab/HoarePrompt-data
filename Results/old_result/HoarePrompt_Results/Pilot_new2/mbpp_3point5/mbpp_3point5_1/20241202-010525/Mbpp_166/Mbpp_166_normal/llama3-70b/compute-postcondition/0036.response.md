Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements (i, j) in `nums` such that the XOR operation results in an even number, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to the length of `nums`, `count` is the final count of pairs that result in an even XOR operation after iterating through all combinations of `i` and `j`.**
