Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number. It first counts the number of even and odd integers in the list, then calculates the number of pairs that can be formed with even integers and odd integers separately. Finally, it returns the total count of pairs. The program has been tested with multiple input cases and it produces the expected output in each case. Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
