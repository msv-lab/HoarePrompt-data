You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function that counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: nums is a list of integers.**
def func_1(nums):
    count = 0
    for i in range(len(nums)):
        for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):
            if (nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0:
                count += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. After the loop finishes executing, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements (i, j) in `nums` such that the XOR operation between nums[i] and nums[j] results in an even number. `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `j` is equal to the length of `nums` - 1.
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of pairs of elements (i, j) in `nums` such that the XOR operation between nums[i] and nums[j] results in an even number. `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `j` is equal to the length of `nums` - 1

```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
