According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is within the range of `i + 1` to the length of `nums` exclusive. Since `i` is 2 and `j` is equal to the length of `nums`, in order for the loop to execute, `j` needs to be greater than 2 (i + 1) and less than the length of `nums`. The total number of pairs of elements in `nums` such that the XOR operation results in an even number depends on the elements in the list. So, the `count` value does not need to be modified. 
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements (i, j) in `nums` such that the XOR operation results in an even number, `i` is 2, `j` is greater than 2 and less than the length of `nums`**
