    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. After the loop finishes executing, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements (i, j) in `nums` such that the XOR operation between nums[i] and nums[j] results in an even number. `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `j` is equal to the length of `nums` - 1.
    return count
    #The program returns the total number of pairs of elements (i, j) in `nums` such that the XOR operation between nums[i] and nums[j] results in an even number. `i` is equal to the length of `nums`, and `j` is equal to the length of `nums` - 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter nums, which is a list of integers. It calculates the total number of pairs of elements (i, j) in nums such that the XOR operation between nums[i] and nums[j] results in an even number. The function iterates through all possible pairs of elements in nums and increments count whenever the XOR operation results in an even number. Finally, it returns the total count of such pairs. The function assumes nums has at least 2 elements.
