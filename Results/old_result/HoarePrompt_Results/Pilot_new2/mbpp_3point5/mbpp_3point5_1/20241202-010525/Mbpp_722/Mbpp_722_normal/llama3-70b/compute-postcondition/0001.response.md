The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_data` is a dictionary where each key is a student name (string) and each value is a tuple of two floats representing the student's height and weight. `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and weight respectively. 

After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary containing the student names, heights, and weights for students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary of student data, a minimum height, and a minimum weight, and return a filtered dictionary containing the student names, heights, and weights that meet the specified criteria. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of student data, a minimum height, and a minimum weight, and returns a filtered dictionary containing the student names, heights, and weights for students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.**
