#State of the program right berfore the function call: student_data is a dictionary where each key is a student name (string) and each value is a tuple of two floats (student_height, student_weight). min_height and min_weight are floats representing the minimum height and weight respectively.**
def func_1(student_data, min_height, min_weight):
    return {name: (height, weight) for name, (height, weight) in student_data.
    items() if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight}
    #The program returns a dictionary containing the student names, heights, and weights for students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a dictionary of student data, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It filters the student data based on the condition that the student's height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight, returning a dictionary containing the names, heights, and weights of these filtered students. However, the code has a syntax error as the return statement is incomplete, resulting in a syntax error when trying to execute the function.
