Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly filters students based on the minimum height and weight criteria. It iterates over the student_data dictionary and selects only those students whose height and weight are both above the minimum specified values. The condition `if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight` ensures that only students meeting both criteria are included in the filtered result. There are no obvious cases where the program would fail to filter students correctly based on the given problem description.
