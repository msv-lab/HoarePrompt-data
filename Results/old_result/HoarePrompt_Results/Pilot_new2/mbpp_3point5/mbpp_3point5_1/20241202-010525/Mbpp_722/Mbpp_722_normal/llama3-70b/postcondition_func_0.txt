The function func_1 accepts a dictionary of student data, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It filters the student data based on the condition that the student's height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight, returning a dictionary containing the names, heights, and weights of these filtered students. However, the code has a syntax error as the return statement is incomplete, resulting in a syntax error when trying to execute the function.
