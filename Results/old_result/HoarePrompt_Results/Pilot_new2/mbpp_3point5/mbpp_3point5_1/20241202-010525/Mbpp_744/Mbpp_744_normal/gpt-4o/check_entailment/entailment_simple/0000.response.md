Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the function as described in the problem description. It iterates through the given tuple and checks if any item is None. If it finds a None value, it returns True. If no None value is found in the tuple, it returns False. This aligns with the requirement of checking if the given tuple has any None value or not.
