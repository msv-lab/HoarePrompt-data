Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided for the function `func_1` correctly implements the problem description. It iterates through the items in the tuple and returns True if it encounters a `None` value, otherwise it returns False. The function covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints also align with the code, confirming its correctness. Therefore, the code is correct.
