#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.**
def func_1(tup):
    return any(x is None for x in tup)
    #The program returns True if there is any element in the tuple `tup` that is None, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a tuple `tup` and returns True if there is any element in the tuple `tup` that is None; otherwise, it returns False. If `tup` is empty, the function will return False since there are no elements to check for None.
