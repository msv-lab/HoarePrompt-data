#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *s is a string and s is not empty
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop will return False if any character in the string `s` is different from the first character `first_char`. If all characters are the same as `first_char`, the loop will continue until the end of the string `s` is reached without changing the state of the variables. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `s` remains the same non-empty string, `first_char` is still the first character of `s`, and `char` is equal to `first_char` for all characters in `s`.
    return True
    #The program returns True if all characters in the string `s` are the same as the first character `first_char`, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. It checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same as the first character `first_char`. If all characters match the first character, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. The function does not cover the case where the input string `s` is empty, which should ideally return False.
