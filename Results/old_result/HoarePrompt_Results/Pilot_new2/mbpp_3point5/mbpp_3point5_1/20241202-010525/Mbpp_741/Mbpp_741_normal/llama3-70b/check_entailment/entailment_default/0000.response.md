Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct as it follows the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and returns True if all characters in the string are the same. The code achieves this by converting the string into a set (which removes duplicates) and then checking if the length of the set is equal to 1. This indicates that all characters in the string are the same. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or the output hints that the code does not cover. Therefore, the code is correct.
