Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether all characters in the input string are the same. It does so by first checking if the string is empty, in which case it returns True. Then, it initializes `first_char` as the first character of the input string. It then iterates through all the characters in the string, comparing each character to `first_char`. If any character is different from `first_char`, the program immediately returns False since not all characters are the same. If the loop completes without encountering a different character, it returns True, indicating that all characters are the same.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and correctly determines if all characters in the input string are the same.
