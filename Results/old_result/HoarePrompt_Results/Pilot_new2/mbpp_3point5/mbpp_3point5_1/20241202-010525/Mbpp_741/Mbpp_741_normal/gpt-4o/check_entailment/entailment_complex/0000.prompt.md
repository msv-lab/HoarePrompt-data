You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a python function to check whether all the characters are same or not.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string.
def func_1(s):
    if (not s) :
        return True
        #The program returns True
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *s is a string and s is not empty
    first_char = s[0]
    for char in s:
        if char != first_char:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop will return False if any character in the string `s` is different from the first character `first_char`. If all characters are the same as `first_char`, the loop will continue until the end of the string `s` is reached without changing the state of the variables. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, `s` remains the same non-empty string, `first_char` is still the first character of `s`, and `char` is equal to `first_char` for all characters in `s`.
    return True
    #The program returns True if all characters in the string `s` are the same as the first character `first_char`, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string. It checks if all characters in the string `s` are the same as the first character `first_char`. If all characters match the first character, it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False. The function does not cover the case where the input string `s` is empty, which should ideally return False.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
