According to the code, the loop will iterate through each character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is equal to `first_char`, and `char` is equal to `first_char`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the string should become the new `char`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is equal to the next character in `s`.**
