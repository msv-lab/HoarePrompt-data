Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input. It then uses a generator expression along with the `all` function to check if all elements in the list `lst` are in non-decreasing order by comparing each element with the next one. If all elements satisfy this condition, the function returns `True`, otherwise it returns `False`.

This program aligns with the problem description as it correctly determines whether a specified list is sorted or not, specifically checking for non-decreasing order. It covers all potential cases by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one, ensuring that the list is truly sorted in ascending order.
