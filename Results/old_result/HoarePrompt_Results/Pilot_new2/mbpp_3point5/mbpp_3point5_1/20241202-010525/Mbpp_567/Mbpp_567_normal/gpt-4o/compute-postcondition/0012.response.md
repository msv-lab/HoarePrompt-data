The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of comparable elements. The function iterates through the list and checks if each element `lst[i]` is greater than the next element `lst[i+1]`. If at any point during the loop, `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i+1]`, the function returns False. If the loop completes without finding such a pair of elements, the function returns True. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` of comparable elements and return True unless there is a pair of elements where the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i+1`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of comparable elements. It returns True unless at any point during the loop, lst[i] is greater than lst[i+1], in which case it returns False.**
