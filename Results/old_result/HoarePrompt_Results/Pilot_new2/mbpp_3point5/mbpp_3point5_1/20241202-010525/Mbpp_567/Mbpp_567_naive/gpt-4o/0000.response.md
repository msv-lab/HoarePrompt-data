Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not cover the case where the list is sorted in descending order. The program only checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element, but it does not consider the descending order scenario. 

For example, `assert func_1([20, 14, 12, 10, 8, 6, 4, 2, 1]) == False` would fail as the program does not handle the case where the list is sorted in descending order.
