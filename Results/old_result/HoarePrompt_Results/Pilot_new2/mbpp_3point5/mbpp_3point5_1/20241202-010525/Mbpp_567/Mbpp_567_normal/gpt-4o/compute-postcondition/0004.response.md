According to the code, the loop iterates over the indices of the list `lst` up to the second to last index, comparing elements at index `i` and `i+1`. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, and the element at index `i` is less than or equal to the element at index `i+1`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the index `i` should be incremented by 1, so the loop would iterate up to the new second to last index which is the original last index. This means that the new index `i` should be `i+1` and the element at this new index should be less than or equal to the element at the index `i+1+1` (or `i+2`).

State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 3 elements. The element at index i+1 is less than or equal to the element at index i+2**
