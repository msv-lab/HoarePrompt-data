According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than the length of the list `lst` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 3 elements, and the element at index i+1 is less than or equal to the element at index i+2. 

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the index `i` and ensure that the element at index i+1 is less than or equal to the element at index i+2. Therefore, for the next iteration of the loop, the new state should be:
State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 3 elements. The element at index i+1 is less than or equal to the element at index i+2 and i must be less than the length of lst - 2**
