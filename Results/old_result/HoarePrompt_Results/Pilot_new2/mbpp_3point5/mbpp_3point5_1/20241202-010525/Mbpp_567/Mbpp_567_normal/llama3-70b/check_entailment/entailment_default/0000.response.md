Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` of comparable elements and checks if all elements are in non-decreasing order. It does this by using a list comprehension to compare each element to the next element in the list, ensuring that each element is less than or equal to the next element. If this condition holds true for all elements, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.

After reviewing the code and the problem description, it seems that the code handles all possible cases and scenarios as described in the problem. Additionally, the output hints align with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct in determining whether a specified list is sorted or not.
