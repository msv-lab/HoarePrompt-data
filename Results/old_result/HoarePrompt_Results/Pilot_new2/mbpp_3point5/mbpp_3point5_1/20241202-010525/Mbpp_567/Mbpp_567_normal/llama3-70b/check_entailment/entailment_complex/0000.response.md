Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` as input and then checks if all elements in the list are in non-decreasing order. The program uses a list comprehension and the `all()` function to check if every element `lst[i]` is less than or equal to the next element `lst[i + 1]`. If this condition is met for all elements in the list, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.

This implementation correctly aligns with the problem description, as it checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by checking if it is in non-decreasing order. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
