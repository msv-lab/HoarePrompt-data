The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`. `lst` is a list and `tup` is a tuple. The function returns the concatenation of list `lst` and the elements of tuple `tup` after converting the elements of the tuple into a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and return the concatenation of `lst` with the elements of `tup` converted into a list. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a tuple tup, returns the concatenation of lst and the elements of tup converted into a list.**
