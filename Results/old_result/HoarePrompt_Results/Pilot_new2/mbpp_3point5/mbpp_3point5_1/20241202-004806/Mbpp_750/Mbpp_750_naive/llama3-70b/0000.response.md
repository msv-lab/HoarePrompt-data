Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input and returns a new list that contains all the elements of `lst` followed by the elements of `tup`. The program correctly converts the tuple `tup` to a list using the `list()` function and then concatenates it with the original list `lst`. This implementation follows the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring that the function works as expected.
