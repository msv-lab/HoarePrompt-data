You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and tup is a tuple.**
def func_1(lst, tup):
    return lst + list(tup)
    #The program returns the concatenation of list 'lst' and the elements of tuple 'tup' converted into a list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list lst and a tuple tup, then returns the result of concatenating lst with the elements of tup after converting them into a list. The code accurately performs this concatenation operation without any missing functionality or edge cases.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
