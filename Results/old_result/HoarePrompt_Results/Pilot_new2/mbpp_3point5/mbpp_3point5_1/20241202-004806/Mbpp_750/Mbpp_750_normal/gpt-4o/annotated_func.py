#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and tpl is a tuple.
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
    #The program returns the concatenation of list 'lst' and the elements of tuple 'tpl' converted into a list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list lst and a tuple tpl, then returns the concatenation of the list lst with the elements of the tuple tpl converted into a list. If either parameter is not a list or tuple, the function might not work as intended.
