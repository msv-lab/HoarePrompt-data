The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `tpl`, which is a tuple. After executing the function body, the program returns the concatenation of list `lst` and the elements of tuple `tpl` converted into a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and return the concatenation of `lst` with the elements of `tpl` converted into a list. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a tuple tpl, returns the concatenation of lst with the elements of tpl converted into a list.**
