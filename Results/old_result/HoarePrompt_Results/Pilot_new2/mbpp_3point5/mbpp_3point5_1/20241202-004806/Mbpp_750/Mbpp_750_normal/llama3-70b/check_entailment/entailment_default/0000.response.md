Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as inputs. It then concatenates the elements of the tuple `tup` to the list `lst` after converting the tuple elements into a list. This implementation aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires adding the given tuple to the given list. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and there are no edge cases that are not handled. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the function performs the concatenation operation correctly.
