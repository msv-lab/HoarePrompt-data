Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder, calculates the volume using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, and returns the volume. This exactly matches the problem description, which requires the function to return the volume of a cylinder based on its radius and height. The program is correct for all potential cases as it follows the problem description accurately.
