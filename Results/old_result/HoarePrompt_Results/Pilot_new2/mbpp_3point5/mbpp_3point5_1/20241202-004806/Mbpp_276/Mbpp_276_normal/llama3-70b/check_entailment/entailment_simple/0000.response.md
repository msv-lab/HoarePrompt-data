Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and correctly calculates the volume using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. The program returns the volume as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
