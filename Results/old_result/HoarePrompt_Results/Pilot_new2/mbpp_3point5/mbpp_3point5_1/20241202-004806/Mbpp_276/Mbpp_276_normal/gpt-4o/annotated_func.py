#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative numbers.**
def func_1(radius, height):
    volume = math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    return volume
    #The program returns the volume which is equal to math.pi * radius
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two non-negative numbers, calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula math.pi * radius^2 * height, and returns the calculated volume.
