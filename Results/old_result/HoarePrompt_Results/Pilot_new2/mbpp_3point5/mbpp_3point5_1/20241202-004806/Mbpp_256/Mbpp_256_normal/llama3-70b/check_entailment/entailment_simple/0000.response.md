Correctness: **True**

The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `is_prime`, which work together to determine the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number `n`. 

- The `is_prime` function correctly checks if a given number `num` is prime by iterating up to the square root of `num` and checking for divisibility.
- The `func_1` function correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than `n` by iterating from 2 to `n` and using the `is_prime` function to determine if each number is prime.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and returns the correct count of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number `n`.
