Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The program does not handle the case when the input `n` is 1 or 2. According to the problem description, the function should return 0 for these cases. However, in the provided program, there is no specific condition to check for these cases and handle them appropriately. As a result, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
