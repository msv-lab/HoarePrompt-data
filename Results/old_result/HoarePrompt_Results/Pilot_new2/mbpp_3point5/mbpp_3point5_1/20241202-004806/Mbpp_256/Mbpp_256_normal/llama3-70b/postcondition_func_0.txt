The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n and calculates the number of prime numbers between 2 and n (inclusive). If n itself is a prime number, the count is increased by 1. The function iterates through numbers from 2 to n (excluding n) and checks if each number is prime, incrementing the count accordingly. The function does not handle the case where n is less than 3 or negative numbers, which could lead to unexpected behavior.
