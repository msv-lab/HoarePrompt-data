According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range specified by `range(i * i, n, i)`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 2 and a prime number, `j` is 4, and `is_prime[j]` is False.

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state as follows:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 2 and a prime number, `j` is 6, `is_prime[j]` is False**
