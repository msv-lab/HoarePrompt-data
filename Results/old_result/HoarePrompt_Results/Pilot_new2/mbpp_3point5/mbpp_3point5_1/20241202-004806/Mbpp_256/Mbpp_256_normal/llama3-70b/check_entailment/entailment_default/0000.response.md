Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The `func_1` function correctly iterates through numbers from 2 to n (excluding n) and checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function. The count is incremented for each prime number found.
- The `is_prime` function correctly identifies prime numbers by checking if the number is divisible by any number in the range [2, sqrt(num)+1).
- The function handles the case where num is less than 2 by returning False, which aligns with the problem description.
- The output descriptions accurately describe the functionality of both functions and do not introduce any unexpected behavior.
