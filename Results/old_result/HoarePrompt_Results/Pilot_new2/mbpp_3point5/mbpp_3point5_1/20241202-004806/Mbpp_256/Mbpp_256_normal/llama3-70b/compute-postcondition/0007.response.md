According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num`, `i`, and the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and the square root of `num` is an integer. Additionally, `num` is not divisible by 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the updated state should be as follows:
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3, square root of `num` is an integer, `num` is not divisible by 2**
