According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of n elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, and `i` is 2.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next number in the range. Additionally, since the loop condition is `i` is less than the square root of `n`, the next iteration will be for `i` equal to 3.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of n elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 3**
