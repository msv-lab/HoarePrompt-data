According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 3 (larger than 2). Before the loop starts, `is_prime` list should be updated such that `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are False, and all the other elements are True. Additionally, `i` should be initialized as 2 to satisfy the starting range of the loop.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, n is larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of n elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 2**
