According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 16, `is_prime` is a list of n elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 5, and `is_prime[j]` is equal to False. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider that `j` is incremented by `i` each iteration. So, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to find the next value of `j` that is less than `n`. 

Given that `i` is 5, the next value of `j` would be 25 (i * i). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time:
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 16, `is_prime` is a list of n elements initialized as True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, `i` is 5, `is_prime[25]` is equal to False**
