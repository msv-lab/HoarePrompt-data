Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function that correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently find all prime numbers up to the given number 'n'. The program then verifies its correctness by checking against known test cases, which all pass successfully. Therefore, based on the provided program and the test cases, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
