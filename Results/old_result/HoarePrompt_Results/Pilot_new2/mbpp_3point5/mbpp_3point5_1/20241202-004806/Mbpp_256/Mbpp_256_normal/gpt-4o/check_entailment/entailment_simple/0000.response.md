Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes a non-negative integer `n`, generates a list `is_prime` to store whether each number up to `n` is prime or not, and then calculates the number of prime numbers less than `n`. The program efficiently uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers and count the prime numbers. The implementation correctly handles cases where `n` is less than or equal to 2, returning 0 as expected. Overall, the program follows the problem description and outputs the correct number of prime numbers less than the given integer.
