Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function that correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. The `is_prime` helper function correctly checks if a number is prime or not, and the main function `func_1` correctly iterates through all numbers less than the input number and counts the prime numbers. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases, making the program correct.
