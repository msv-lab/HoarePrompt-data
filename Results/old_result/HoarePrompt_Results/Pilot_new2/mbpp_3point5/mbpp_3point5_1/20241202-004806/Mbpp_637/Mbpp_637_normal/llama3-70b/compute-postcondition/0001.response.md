The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, both of which are non-negative integers representing the cost price and selling price of an item, respectively. After executing the function body, if the cost price is equal to the selling price, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and return True if the cost price is equal to the selling price. If the cost price is not equal to the selling price, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integers representing cost price and selling price, returns True if they are equal, otherwise it returns False.**
