Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the problem description by checking whether the cost price is equal to the selling price. If the cost price is equal to the selling price, the function returns True, indicating that there is no profit and no loss. If the cost price is not equal to the selling price, the function returns False, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, the program follows the problem description for every potential case.
