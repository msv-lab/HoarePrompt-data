The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `cost_price` and `selling_price`. Both `cost_price` and `selling_price` are non-negative integers representing the cost price and selling price of an item respectively. After executing the function body, if the cost price is equal to the selling price, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative integers `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and return True if the cost price is equal to the selling price of an item. If they are not equal, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integers representing the cost price and selling price of an item. Returns True if the cost price is equal to the selling price, otherwise returns False.**
