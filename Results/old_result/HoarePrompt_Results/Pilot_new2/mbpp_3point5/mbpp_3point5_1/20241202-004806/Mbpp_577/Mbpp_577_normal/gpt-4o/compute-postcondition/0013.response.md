Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. 
If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. 
If `n` is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to return 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5, and the last digit of the factorial of `n` if `n` is less than 5.**
