Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` is expected to return the last digit of the factorial of a given number if that number is less than 5, and 0 if the number is greater than or equal to 5. However, the code only checks if the given number is greater than or equal to 5 to return 0 without calculating the factorial. This means that for numbers less than 5, the code fails to calculate the factorial and return the last digit, which is not in line with the problem description. 

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
