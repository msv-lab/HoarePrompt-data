Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input. The program first checks if `n` is greater than or equal to 5, in which case it returns 0, as required by the problem description.

If `n` is less than 5, the program calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial, which also aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
