Correctness: False

The given program is incorrect because it does not return the correct last digit of the factorial for all cases. 

For example, if we test the function with `func_1(30)`, the expected output should be 0 since 30 factorial ends with a 0. However, the program returns 8 which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making it incorrect.
