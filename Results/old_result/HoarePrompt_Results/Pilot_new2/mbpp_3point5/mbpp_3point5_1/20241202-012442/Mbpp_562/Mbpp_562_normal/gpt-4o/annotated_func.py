#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists.**
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_length = 0
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        if len(sublist) > max_length:
            max_length = len(sublist)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, where `max_length` is equal to the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`.
    return max_length
    #The program returns the length of the longest sublist in the list 'list_of_lists', which is stored in the variable 'max_length'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists. It iterates over each sublist in the input list and determines the length of the longest sublist. The function then returns the length of this longest sublist as the output.
