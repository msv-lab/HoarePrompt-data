Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly iterates through each sublist in the `list_of_lists` and compares the length of each sublist to the current maximum length. It updates the `max_length` variable when a longer sublist is found. The function then returns the correct length of the longest sublist. All the provided test cases pass successfully, indicating that the function works as expected for various inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
