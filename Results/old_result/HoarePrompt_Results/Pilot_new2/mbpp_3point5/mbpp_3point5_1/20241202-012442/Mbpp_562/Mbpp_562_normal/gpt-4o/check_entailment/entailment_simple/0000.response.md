Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly finds the length of the longest sublist in the given list of lists. It iterates through each sublist, compares the length of each sublist with the current maximum length, and updates the maximum length if a longer sublist is found. Finally, it returns the length of the longest sublist, which is stored in the variable `max_length`. This program follows the problem description and always returns the length of the longest sublist in the list `list_of_lists`.
