The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists of the same length containing integers. After executing the function body, the program returns a list of the same length as `list1` and `list2`, where each element in the list is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`. If the length of `list1` is not equal to the length of `list2`, a ValueError is raised stating 'Both lists must be of the same length'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists `list1` and `list2` containing integers of the same length, and return a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`, while also handling the case where the input lists are not of equal length.
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, list1 and list2, containing integers of the same length. It returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in list1 by list2. If the lengths of list1 and list2 are not equal, a ValueError is raised.**
