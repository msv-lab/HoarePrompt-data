Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two lists, list1 and list2, containing integers of the same length. It then returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in list1 by list2. If the lengths of list1 and list2 are not equal, a ValueError is raised stating 'Both lists must be of the same length'. **

The code does what the annotations describe, ensuring that the input lists are of the same length before performing element-wise division. If the lengths do not match, it raises a ValueError as expected.
