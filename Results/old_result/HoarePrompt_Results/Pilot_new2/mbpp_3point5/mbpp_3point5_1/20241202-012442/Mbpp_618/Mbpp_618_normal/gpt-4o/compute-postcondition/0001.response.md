The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers with the same length. After executing the function body, the program returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of numbers with the same length, perform element-wise division between the corresponding elements in the lists, and return a new list with the results. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, which are lists of numbers with the same length. It returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in list1 by list2.**
