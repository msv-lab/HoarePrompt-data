Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input and returns a new list by dividing the elements of `list1` by the elements of `list2` element-wise using list comprehension and the `zip` function. The provided test cases cover different scenarios such as dividing integers and floats, dividing by 0, and having different lengths of input lists. All the test cases pass successfully, demonstrating that the function works correctly according to the problem description.
