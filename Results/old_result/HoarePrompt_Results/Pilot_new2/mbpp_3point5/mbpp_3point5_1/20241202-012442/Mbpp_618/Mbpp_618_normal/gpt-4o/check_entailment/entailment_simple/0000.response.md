Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input. It then uses a list comprehension to iterate over the elements of both `list1` and `list2` simultaneously using `zip` and performs element-wise division between the corresponding elements. The program returns a new list containing the results of the division.

This matches the problem description which asks for a function to divide two lists element-wise, and the program achieves this by dividing each element of `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. Therefore, the program is correct.
