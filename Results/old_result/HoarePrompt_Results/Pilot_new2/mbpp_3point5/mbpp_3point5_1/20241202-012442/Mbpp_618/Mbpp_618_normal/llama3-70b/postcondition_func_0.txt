The function func_1 accepts two lists, list1 and list2, containing integers of the same length. It then returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in list1 by list2. If the lengths of list1 and list2 are not equal, a ValueError is raised stating 'Both lists must be of the same length'.
