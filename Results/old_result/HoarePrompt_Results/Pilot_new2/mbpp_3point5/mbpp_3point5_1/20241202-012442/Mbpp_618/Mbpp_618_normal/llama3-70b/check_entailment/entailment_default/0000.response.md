Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in two lists, `list1` and `list2`, containing integers of the same length. It then returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`. If the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are not equal, a ValueError is raised stating 'Both lists must be of the same length'.

Upon reviewing the code, it can be seen that it correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description. It ensures that both input lists are of the same length, and then performs element-wise division on the two lists using list comprehension and the `zip` function. The code adheres to the specifications provided in the problem description and handles the case where the input lists are not of the same length by raising a ValueError.

Since the code aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases specified, the correctness is evaluated as **True**.
