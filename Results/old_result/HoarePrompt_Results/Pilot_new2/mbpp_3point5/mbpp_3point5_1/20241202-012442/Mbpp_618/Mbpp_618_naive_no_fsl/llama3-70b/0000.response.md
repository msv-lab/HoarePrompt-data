Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program checks if the two input lists are of the same length and raises a ValueError if they are not. Then, it divides the elements of the two lists element-wise using a list comprehension and the `zip` function. This logic covers all potential cases and ensures that the program follows the problem description.
