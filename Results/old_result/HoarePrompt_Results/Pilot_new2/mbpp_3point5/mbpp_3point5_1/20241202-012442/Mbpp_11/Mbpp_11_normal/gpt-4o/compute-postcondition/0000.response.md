Example Answer:
The `first_index` variable is assigned the value of the index of the first occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`. If `ch` is not found in `s`, `first_index` is assigned the value -1. The states of the other variables remain the same.
Output State: **s is a string, ch is a single character string, first_index is the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1 if ch is not found.**
