Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. It uses the `find()` method to get the index of the first occurrence and the `rfind()` method to get the index of the last occurrence of the given character in the string. Then it constructs and returns the modified string by removing the character between the first and last occurrences. The program handles the cases where the character is not found in the string by returning the original string. Upon reviewing the code and considering different test cases, it seems to correctly implement the desired functionality as described in the problem statement.
