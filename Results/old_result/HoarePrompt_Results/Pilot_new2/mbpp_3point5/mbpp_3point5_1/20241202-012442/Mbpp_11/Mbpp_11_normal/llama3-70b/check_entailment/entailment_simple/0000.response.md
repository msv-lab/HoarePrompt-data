Correctness: **False**

The program does not fully meet the problem description. While it correctly finds the first and last occurrences of the given character in the string, it does not remove the characters between the first and last occurrences as per the problem description. 

The line `return s[:first_occ] + s[first_occ + 1:last_occ] + s[last_occ + 1:]` should be modified to `return s[:first_occ] + s[first_occ + 1:last_occ] + s[last_occ + 1:] + s[last_occ + 1:]` to remove the characters between the first and last occurrences. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not fully adhere to the problem description.
