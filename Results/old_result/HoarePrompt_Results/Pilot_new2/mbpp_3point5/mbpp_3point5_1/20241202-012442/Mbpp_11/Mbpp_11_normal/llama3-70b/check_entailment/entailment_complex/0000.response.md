Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It first finds the first and last occurrence of the given character in the string and then removes the characters between these two occurrences. If both occurrences exist, it returns the modified string with characters removed. If either of the occurrences does not exist, it returns the original string `s`. The program meets the requirements of removing the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string.
