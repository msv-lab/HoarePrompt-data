Output State: `s` is a binary string repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times, `count` is the updated value, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `temp` is the substring of `s` starting from index `i+1` and ending at index `i + len(s) + 1`, `count` is updated to include the count of '1's in the substring `temp` modulo 2, `temp` is the substring of `s` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + len(s)`.
