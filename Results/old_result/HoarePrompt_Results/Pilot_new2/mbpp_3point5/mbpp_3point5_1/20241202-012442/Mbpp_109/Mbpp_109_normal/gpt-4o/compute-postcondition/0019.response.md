The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. 
`binary_str` is a string containing only '0's and '1's, and `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. 
After executing the function body, the program returns the count of times the integer value of `binary_str` is odd after each iteration. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `binary_str` containing only '0's and '1's, and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`, and return the count of times the integer value of `binary_str` is odd after each iteration.
