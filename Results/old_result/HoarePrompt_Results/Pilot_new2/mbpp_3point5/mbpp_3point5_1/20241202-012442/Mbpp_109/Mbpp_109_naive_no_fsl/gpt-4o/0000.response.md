Correctness: True

The program takes a binary string and the number of rotations as input. It then rotates the binary string the given number of times and checks if the resulting integer value is odd. If it is odd, it increments the count. The program then returns the total count of odd values after all rotations.

The provided test cases cover a variety of scenarios including both odd and even values, different lengths of binary strings, and different numbers of rotations. All test cases pass successfully, indicating that the program is correctly counting the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.
