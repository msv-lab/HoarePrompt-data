Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is a string containing only '0's and '1's with the last character moved to the beginning, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `count` is 1, `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str` in base 2. After entering the if condition, the `integer_value` is odd (integer_value % 2 == 1).***
