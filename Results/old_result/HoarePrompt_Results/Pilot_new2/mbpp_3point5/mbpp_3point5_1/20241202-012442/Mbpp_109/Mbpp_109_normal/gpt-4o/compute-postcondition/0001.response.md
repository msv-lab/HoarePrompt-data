According to the code, the loop can execute if `num_rotations` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `binary_str` is a string containing only '0's and '1's, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, and `count` is 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `num_rotations` should be greater than 0.
State: **`binary_str` is a string containing only '0's and '1's, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `count` is 0**
