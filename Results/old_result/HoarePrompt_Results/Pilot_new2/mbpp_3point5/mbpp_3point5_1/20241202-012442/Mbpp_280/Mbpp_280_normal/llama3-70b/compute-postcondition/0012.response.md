The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `arr` which is a list and `elem` which can be any data type. 

The function has multiple return cases:
- Case_1: If the first element in the list `arr` is equal to `elem`, the program returns True and the index `i`, where `i` is 0 (index of the first element in the list `arr`).
- Case_2: If the second element in the list `arr` is equal to `elem`, the program returns True and the value of `i`, which is 1.
- Case_3: If the third element in the list `arr` is equal to `elem`, the program returns True and the value of `i`, which is 2.
- Case_4: If none of the elements in the list `arr` is equal to `elem`, the program returns False and -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an element `elem`, and return True along with the index `i` if `elem` is found in the list at the specified index. If `elem` is not found in the list, it returns False and -1.
