According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 element, `i` is 0 (index of the first element), `x` is the first element in the list, and `x` is not equal to `elem`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 elements, and `i` should be 1 (index of the second element), `x` should be the second element in the list, and it should not be equal to `elem`.
State: **`arr` is a list that must have at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in the list and not equal to `elem`**
