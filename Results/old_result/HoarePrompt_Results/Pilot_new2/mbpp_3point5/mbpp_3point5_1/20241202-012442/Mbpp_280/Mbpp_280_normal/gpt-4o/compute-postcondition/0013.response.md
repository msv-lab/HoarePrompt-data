Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` of elements and an `element` of any data type. It iterates through the list to find the `element`. If the `element` is found at index i, it returns True along with the index i. If the `element` is not found, it returns False and index -1.** 

Potential missing functionality: It is not mentioned how the function handles the case when the input list `arr` is empty. The current implementation does not cover this scenario.
