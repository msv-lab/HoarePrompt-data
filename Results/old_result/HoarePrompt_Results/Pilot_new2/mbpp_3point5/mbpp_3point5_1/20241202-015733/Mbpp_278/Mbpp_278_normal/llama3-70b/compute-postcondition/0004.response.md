According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the tuple `tup`. If there is at least one element remaining in the tuple after the previous iteration, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element, and the element `elem` is not a tuple. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least 1 more element in the tuple `tup`.
State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements. The element `elem` is not a tuple**
