Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the elements of the tuple and checks if an element is a tuple. If it finds a tuple element, it returns the index of that element in the tuple. If no tuple element is found, it returns the length of the tuple. However, the code does not handle the case where there are multiple tuple elements in the tuple. It only returns the index of the first tuple element encountered, which may not be the correct behavior as per the problem description. 

For example, if the input tuple is `(1, 2, (3, 4), 5, (6, 7))`, the function should return `[2, 4]` as the output, indicating the indices of the tuple elements. But the current code will only return `2` for the first tuple element encountered.

Therefore, the code is incorrect and does not fully satisfy the problem description.
