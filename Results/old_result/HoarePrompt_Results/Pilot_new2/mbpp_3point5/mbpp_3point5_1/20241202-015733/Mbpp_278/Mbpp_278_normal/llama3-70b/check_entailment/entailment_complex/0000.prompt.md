You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to find the number of elements that occurs before the tuple element in the given tuple.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: tup is a tuple.
def func_1(tup):
    for elem in tup:
        if isinstance(elem, tuple):
            return tup.index(elem)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element. The element `elem` is not a tuple. The function returns the index of the first tuple in `tup`, if any. Otherwise, the function returns None.
    return len(tup)
    #The program returns the length of tuple `tup`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple. It iterates through the elements of the tuple and checks if an element is a tuple. If it finds a tuple element, it returns the index of that element in the tuple. If no tuple element is found, it returns the length of the tuple. Therefore, the function provides the index of the first tuple element in the tuple if present, otherwise returns the length of the tuple.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
