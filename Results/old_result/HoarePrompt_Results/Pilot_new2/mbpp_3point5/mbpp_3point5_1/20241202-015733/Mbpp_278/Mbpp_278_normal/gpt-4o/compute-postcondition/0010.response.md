According to the code, the loop can execute until the end of the `tup` tuple. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` is a non-empty tuple, `elem` is the next element in the tuple, `count` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, the next element `elem` should be the element following the current `elem` in the tuple `tup`
State: **`tup` is a non-empty tuple, `elem` is the next element in the tuple, `count` is 3**
