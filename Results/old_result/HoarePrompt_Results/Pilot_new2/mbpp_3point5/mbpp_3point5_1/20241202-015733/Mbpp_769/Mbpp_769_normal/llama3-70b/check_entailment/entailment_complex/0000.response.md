Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description as it returns a sorted list of unique elements that are present in either list1 or list2, but not in both. The use of set operations ensures that only unique elements are considered and the sorting ensures the final output is in ascending order. The program handles all potential cases and edge cases as described in the problem description. Thus, the program is correct.
