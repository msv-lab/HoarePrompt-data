Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the string with all spaces replaced by '%20'. The program uses the `replace` method to directly replace spaces with '%20' in the input string `s`. This implementation aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should replace all spaces in the given string with '%20'. Therefore, the program is correct as it meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
