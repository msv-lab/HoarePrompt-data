Correctness: **True**

The program defined in the annotated code correctly implements the problem description by using the `replace()` function in Python to replace all spaces in the input string with '%20'. This ensures that the output string has all spaces replaced as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
