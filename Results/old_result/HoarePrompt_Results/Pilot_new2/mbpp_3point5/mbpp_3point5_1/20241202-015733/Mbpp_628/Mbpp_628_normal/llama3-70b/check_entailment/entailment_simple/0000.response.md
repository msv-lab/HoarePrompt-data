Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and uses the `replace` method in Python to replace all spaces in the string with '%20'. This implementation exactly matches the problem description, which asks for a function to replace all spaces in the given string with '%20'. Therefore, the program is correct.
