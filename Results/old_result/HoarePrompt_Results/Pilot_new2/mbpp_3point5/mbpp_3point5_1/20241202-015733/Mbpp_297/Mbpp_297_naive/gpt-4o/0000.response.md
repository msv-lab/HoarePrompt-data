Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly flattens a given nested list structure by recursively going through each element and appending it to a flat list. The program accounts for the case where an element in the nested list is another list by recursively calling the function on that nested list. 

All the provided test cases pass successfully, indicating that the program works as expected for different nested list structures. Therefore, the program can be considered correct as it meets the requirements of the given problem description.
