Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a nested list as input and returns a flattened list as output. It uses recursion to iterate through the nested list structure and flatten it by appending non-list elements to the `flat_list` and recursively calling itself on sublist elements.

The program correctly flattens any given nested list structure as required by the problem description. It handles all cases where the input is a nested list and properly returns the flattened structure. Since the program uses recursion, it can handle nested structures of any depth and correctly flatten them.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
