Postcondition: ***nested_list is a list that must have at least 1 element, flat_list is updated based on the condition. If the first element of nested_list is a list, flat_list will contain the elements returned by func_1(element). Otherwise, if the first element of nested_list is not a list, flat_list will only contain the first element of nested_list.***
