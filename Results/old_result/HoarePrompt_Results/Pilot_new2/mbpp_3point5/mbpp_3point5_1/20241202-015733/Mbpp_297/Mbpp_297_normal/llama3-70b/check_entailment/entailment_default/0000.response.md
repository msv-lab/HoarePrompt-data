Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly follows the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a nested list as input and recursively flattens the nested list structure by iterating through each element. If the element is a list, it calls the `func_1` recursively on that element. If the element is not a list, it appends it to the `flat_list`. This process continues until all nested lists are flattened, and the function returns the flattened list. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and does not have any logical errors.
