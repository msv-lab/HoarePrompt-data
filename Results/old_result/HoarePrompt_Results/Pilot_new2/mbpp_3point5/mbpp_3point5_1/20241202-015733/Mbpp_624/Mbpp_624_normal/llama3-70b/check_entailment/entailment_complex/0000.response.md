Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of the string using the `upper()` method. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a Python function to convert a given string to uppercase. The program consistently follows the problem description for all potential cases.
