Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the input string converted to uppercase using the `upper()` method. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires us to write a Python function to convert a given string to uppercase.

The function provided in the annotated program always fulfills the problem description as it correctly converts any input string to uppercase without any missing functionality or edge cases. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
