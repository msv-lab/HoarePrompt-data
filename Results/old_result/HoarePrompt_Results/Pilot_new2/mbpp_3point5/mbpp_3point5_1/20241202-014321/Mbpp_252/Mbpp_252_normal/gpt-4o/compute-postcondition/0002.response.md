Functionality: ** The function accepts a complex number 'num' and calculates its polar coordinates (r, phi) using the cmath.polar() function. **

The function does what the annotations describe, accepting a complex number 'num' and returning its polar coordinates. However, an edge case to consider is that if 'num' is not provided as a complex number, the function may encounter a TypeError. Therefore, additional logic to handle non-complex number inputs could be beneficial.
