Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it is missing the import statement for the `cmath` module which is required for performing operations on complex numbers. The code will raise a `NameError` when trying to execute `cmath.polar(complex(num))` as `cmath` is not defined. 

To correct the program, we need to add the following import statement at the beginning of the code:
```
import cmath
```
