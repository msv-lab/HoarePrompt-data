Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements and returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The program uses list comprehensions to achieve this, iterating over the input list and extracting the first and second elements accordingly. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
