Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements. It then extracts all the first elements of the sublists to form the first list and all the second elements to form the second list, as described in the problem description. The function returns a list of two lists, with the first list containing all the first elements and the second list containing all the second elements. The code is handling all potential cases correctly as per the given problem description, and all the provided examples pass successfully. The output hints also accurately describe the functionality of the code, confirming that the code aligns with the problem description.
