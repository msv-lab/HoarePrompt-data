Correctness: **False**

The program does not follow the problem description as it is only removing lowercase characters, not substrings. For example, if we input 'PYTHon', the expected output should be 'PYTH', but the actual output is 'PYTHn' because 'on' is not removed as a substring. Hence, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as per the problem description.
