Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It takes a string as input and returns a new string that contains only the uppercase characters from the original string. The list comprehension `[char for char in s if char.isupper()]` filters out any lowercase characters from the input string 's' and returns only the uppercase characters. The `join` method then concatenates these uppercase characters into a new string, which is returned by the function. This process effectively removes all lowercase substrings from the given string, as required by the problem description.
