Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string that only contains the uppercase characters from the original string.

This function directly addresses the problem description of removing lowercase substrings from a given string by using list comprehension to filter out only the uppercase characters. Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description for every potential case.
