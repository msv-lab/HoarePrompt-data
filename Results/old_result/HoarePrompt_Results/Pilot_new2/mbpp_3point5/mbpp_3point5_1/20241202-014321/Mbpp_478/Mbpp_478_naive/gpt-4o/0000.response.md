Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program defines a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with only the uppercase characters. The program uses list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string and includes only the characters that are uppercase using the `isupper()` method. The program then joins these characters back together to form the final output string.

All the provided test cases pass and the logic of the program aligns with the problem description. The program correctly removes lowercase substrings from the given string, making it a correct solution to the problem.
