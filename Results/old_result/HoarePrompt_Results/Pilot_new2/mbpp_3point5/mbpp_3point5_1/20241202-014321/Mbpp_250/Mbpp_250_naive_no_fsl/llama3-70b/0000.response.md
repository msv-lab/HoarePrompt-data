Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program simply uses the `count` method available for tuples in Python to count the occurrences of the given element in the tuple. Since the description only requires counting the occurrences of the element in the tuple, the program meets the requirements for all potential cases. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the program would fail to count the occurrences of the element correctly.
