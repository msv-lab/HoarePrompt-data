Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the function described in the problem description. It takes in a tuple and an element, then counts the occurrences of that element in the tuple using the `count` method. The function returns the correct count of the element in the tuple, as required by the problem description. It does not handle cases where the element is not in the tuple, but the problem description does not specify that such cases need to be handled. Therefore, the program is correct.
