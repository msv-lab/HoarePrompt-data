Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct as it simply uses the `count` method of tuples in Python to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The problem description clearly states that the function takes a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as input and returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup, which is exactly what the code does. Additionally, there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the code might not be handling, and the output hints also agree with the code functionality. Therefore, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases.
