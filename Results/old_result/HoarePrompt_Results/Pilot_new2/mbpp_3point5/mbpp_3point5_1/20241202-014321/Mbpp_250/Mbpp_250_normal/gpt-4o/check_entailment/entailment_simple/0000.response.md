Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the `element` in the `tup`. This implementation exactly matches the problem description, as it correctly counts the occurrences of the `element` in the given tuple. Therefore, the program is correct.
