Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function called `func_1` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum value between them using the `max()` function. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a Python function to find the maximum of two numbers. The program consistently returns the correct maximum value for any given pair of integers, thus meeting the requirements of the problem description.
