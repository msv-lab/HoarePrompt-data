Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code accurately follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in an array and an element, then iterates through the array to check if the element exists. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with True and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with False and -1 as the index. The code handles all cases as described in the problem statement, and there are no edge cases mentioned in the description that the code fails to cover. The examples provided also show that the code works correctly for different input arrays and elements. Therefore, the code is correct.
