Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly iterates through the array and checks if the element is equal to the value at each index. If it finds a match, it returns a tuple containing True and the index of the element. If no match is found, it returns a tuple containing False and -1. The provided test cases also confirm that the function is working as expected for various inputs. Therefore, the program is correct.
