Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the function as described in the problem description. The function iterates through the array using enumerate to get both the index and element at that index. If the element is found, it returns a tuple containing True and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple containing False and -1. This behavior matches exactly what the problem description specifies.

Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
