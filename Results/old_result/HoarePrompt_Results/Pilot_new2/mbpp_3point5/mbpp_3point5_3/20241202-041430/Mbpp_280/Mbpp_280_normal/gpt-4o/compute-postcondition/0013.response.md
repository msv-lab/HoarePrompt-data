Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `arr` and an element `element`. It iterates through the list `arr` and returns True along with the index where the `element` is found if it exists in the list. If the `element` is not found, it returns False and -1 as the index value. The function accurately handles the cases where the element is found, the element is not found, and also when the loop does not execute.**
