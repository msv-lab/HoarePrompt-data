Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the list `arr` to find the first occurrence of the element `elem`. If the element is found, it returns True along with the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns False and -1. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, including when the element is found at different positions in the list. The code does not have any specific edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the description that it fails to handle. Therefore, the code seems to be correct.
