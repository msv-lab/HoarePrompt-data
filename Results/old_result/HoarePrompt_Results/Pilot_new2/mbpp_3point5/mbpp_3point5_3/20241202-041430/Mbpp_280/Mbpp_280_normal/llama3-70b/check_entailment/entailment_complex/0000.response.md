Correctness: **True**

The program `func_1` correctly follows the problem description. It takes in an array `arr` and an element `elem`, iterates through the list to find the first occurrence of `elem`, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). The annotations provided also cover the different scenarios based on the state of the program.

Even though the annotation does not explicitly mention the case when the list `arr` is empty, the return statement after the for loop handles this case correctly by returning False and -1. Therefore, the program meets the problem description for all potential cases.
