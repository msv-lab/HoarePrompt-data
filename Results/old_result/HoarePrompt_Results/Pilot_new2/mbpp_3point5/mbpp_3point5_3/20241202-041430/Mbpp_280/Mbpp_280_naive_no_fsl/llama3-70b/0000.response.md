Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function correctly takes in an array and an element, then iterates through the array to check if the element is present. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with a boolean indicating True and the index position of the element. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with a boolean indicating False and -1 as the index position. The function covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
