Output State: **If the loop executes, it means that the element was found in arr at some index. Therefore, after all iterations of the loop, the output state would be `arr` is a list with at least one element, `index` is the index where element was found, `value` is the element equal to `element`. If the loop does not execute, the output state would be `arr` is a list, `index` is not defined, `value` is not defined.**
