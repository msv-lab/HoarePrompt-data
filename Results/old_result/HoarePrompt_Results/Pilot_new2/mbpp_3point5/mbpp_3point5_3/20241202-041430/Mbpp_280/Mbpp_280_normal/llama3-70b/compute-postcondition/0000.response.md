According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, arr is still a list and elem is any data type. So for the loop to be executed the list must have at least 1 element and i is the index of the first element in the list, and x is the first element in the list.
State: **arr is a list that must have at least 1 element, elem is any data type, i is 0 (index of the first element in the list), x is the first element in the list**
