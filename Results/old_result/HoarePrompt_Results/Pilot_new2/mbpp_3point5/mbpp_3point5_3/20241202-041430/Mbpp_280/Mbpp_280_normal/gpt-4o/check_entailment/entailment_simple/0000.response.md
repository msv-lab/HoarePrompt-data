Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes in an array and an element, iterates through the array to check if the element is present, and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element. If the element is not found, it returns False and -1, as specified in the problem description. The program handles both cases where the element is found in the array and where it is not found, making it a correct implementation.
