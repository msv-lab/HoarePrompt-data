Correctness: True

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist within the input list. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for finding the length of the longest sublists. The program achieves this by using a generator expression within the `max` function to calculate the length of each sublist and then returning the maximum length. The annotations provided in the code also accurately describe the purpose of the function. Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
