According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list_of_lists. If the list has at least 2 sublists, the loop can execute again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, list_of_lists has at least 1 sublist, max_length is equal to the length of the first sublist, sublist is the first sublist in list_of_lists. For the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 2 sublists and the sublist should be the second sublist in the list_of_lists.
State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists that must have at least 2 sublists, max_length is equal to the length of the second sublist in list_of_lists, sublist is the second sublist in list_of_lists**
