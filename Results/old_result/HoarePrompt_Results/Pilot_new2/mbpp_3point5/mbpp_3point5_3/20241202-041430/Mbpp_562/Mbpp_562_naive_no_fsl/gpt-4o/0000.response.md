Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly finds the length of the longest sublist in a list of lists. It iterates through each sublist and compares the length of each sublist with the current maximum length, updating the maximum length if needed. The provided test cases cover various scenarios, including sublists with different lengths and varying number of sublists. In each case, the program returns the correct length of the longest sublist. Therefore, the program is correct.
