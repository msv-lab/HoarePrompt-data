Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string and a number of rotations as input. It then performs the specified number of rotations on the binary string by shifting it to the right each time. After each rotation, it converts the binary string to an integer and checks if the integer value is odd. If it is odd, the count is incremented.

The program correctly finds the number of times the decimal conversion of each shifted binary string results in an odd number, as required by the problem description. The program loops through the specified number of rotations, shifts the binary string, converts it to an integer, and checks if it's odd, updating the count accordingly. Finally, it returns the count of odd numbers encountered during the rotations.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
