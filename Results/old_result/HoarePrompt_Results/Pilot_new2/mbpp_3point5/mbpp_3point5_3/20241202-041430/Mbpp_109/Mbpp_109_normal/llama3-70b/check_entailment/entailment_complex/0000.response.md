Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the function described in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, repeats the binary string `s` by concatenating it until its length is at least `n`, counts the total number of '1's in all substrings of `s` with a length equal to the length of `s`, and calculates this count modulo 2. The program then returns this count.

The program follows the problem description accurately by finding the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times. With the initialization of the `count` variable to 0 and updating it with the count of '1's in each substring modulo 2, the program provides the correct output for the given input.
