Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`.
- It repeats the binary string `s` by concatenating it until its length is at least `n`.
- Then, it counts the total number of '1's in all substrings of `s` with a length equal to the length of `s`, and calculates this count modulo 2.
- Finally, the function returns this count.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly repeats the binary string and counts the number of '1's in the substrings as described. Additionally, the output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming its correctness.
