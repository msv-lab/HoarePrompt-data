The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str`, a string representing a binary number, and `num_rotations`, a non-negative integer. It then shifts the binary string to the right based on the `num_rotations` value, calculates the decimal value of each shifted string, and counts the number of times the result is an odd number. Finally, the function returns the count of odd decimal values.
