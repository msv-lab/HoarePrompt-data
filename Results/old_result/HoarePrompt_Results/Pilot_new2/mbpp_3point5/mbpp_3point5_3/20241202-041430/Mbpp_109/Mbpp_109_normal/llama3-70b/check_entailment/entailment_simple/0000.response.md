Correctness: **True**

The program takes a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n` as input. It then repeats the binary string `s` as many times as needed to have a total length greater than or equal to `n`. It then iterates through the first `n` characters of the repeated string, calculates the count of '1's in each substring of length equal to the length of the original string `s`, and updates the `count` variable by adding the count modulo 2.

Finally, the program returns the total count of '1's in all substrings of `s` of length `len(s)` modulo 2.

This aligns with the problem description of finding the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times, as the program correctly calculates the number of '1's in the substrings and returns the count modulo 2. Therefore, the program is correct.
