Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in two lists `list1` and `list2` containing numerical elements of the same length. It then returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`. The implementation uses list comprehension and the `zip` function to pair up corresponding elements from the two input lists and perform the division operation. The code correctly handles the division of elements in the lists and produces the expected output for the given examples. Additionally, there are no edge cases where the code might fail to perform the division operation as described in the problem statement. 

Therefore, based on the description and the provided code, the correctness of the program is **True**.
