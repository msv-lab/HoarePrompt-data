Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements in `list1` by `list2`. The annotations in the code also state that both `list1` and `list2` are lists of the same length containing numerical elements.

The implementation of the function using list comprehension and the `zip` function correctly divides the elements of `list1` by the elements of `list2` element-wise. Since the program follows the problem description and the provided annotations ensure that the lists are of the same length and contain numerical elements, the program is correct.
