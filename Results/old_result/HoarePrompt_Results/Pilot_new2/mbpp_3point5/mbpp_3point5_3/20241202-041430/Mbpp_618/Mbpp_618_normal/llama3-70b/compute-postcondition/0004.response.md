The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of equal length containing integers or floats. After executing the function body, the program returns a new list containing the element-wise division of each pair of elements from `list1` and `list2`. If the length of `list1` is not equal to the length of `list2`, a ValueError is raised with the message "Both lists must be of the same length". Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two lists of equal length containing integers or floats, perform element-wise division on each pair of elements, and return a new list. If the input lists are not of the same length, a ValueError is raised. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of equal length containing integers or floats and returns a new list with the element-wise division of each pair of elements. If the input lists are not of the same length, a ValueError is raised.**
