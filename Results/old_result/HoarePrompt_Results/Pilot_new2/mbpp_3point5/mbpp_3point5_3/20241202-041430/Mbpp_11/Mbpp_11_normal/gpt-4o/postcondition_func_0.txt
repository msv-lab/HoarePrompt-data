The function `func_1` takes in a string `s` and a character `ch`. It then finds the first and last index of character `ch` in the string `s`. If either index is -1 or they are the same, the function returns the original string `s`. Otherwise, it returns the modified string `s` with the characters at the first and last index of `ch` removed.
