Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` and a character `c`. It then removes the characters at the indices of the first and last occurrences of character `c` in the string `s` and returns the modified string. If the character `c` is not found in the string `s`, the function simply returns the original string `s`. **
