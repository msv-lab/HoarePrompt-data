Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description. While it correctly identifies the first and last occurrence of the given character in the string, it does not remove both occurrences as specified in the problem description. 

The line `return s[:first_occ] + s[first_occ + 1:last_occ] + s[last_occ + 1:]` should actually be modified to `return s[:first_occ] + s[first_occ + 1:last_occ] + s[last_occ + 1:]` to effectively remove both the first and last occurrences of the given character from the string.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not fully adhere to the problem description.
