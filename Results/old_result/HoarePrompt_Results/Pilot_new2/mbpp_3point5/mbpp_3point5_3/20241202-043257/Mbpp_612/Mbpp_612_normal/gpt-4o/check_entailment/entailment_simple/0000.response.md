Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input. It then creates two new lists `first_elements` and `second_elements` using list comprehensions to extract the first and second elements of each sublist in the input list respectively. Finally, it returns a list containing these two new lists.

This implementation meets the requirements of the problem description as it correctly returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first elements of each sublist and the second list contains the second elements of each sublist. The program follows the problem description for every potential case, so the correctness is true.
