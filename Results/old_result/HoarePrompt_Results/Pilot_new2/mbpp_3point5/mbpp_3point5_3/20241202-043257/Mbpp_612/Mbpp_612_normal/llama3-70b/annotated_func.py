#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements.**
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [list(element[0] for element in list_of_lists), list(element[1] for
    element in list_of_lists)]
    #The program returns two lists, the first list contains the first element of each sublist in list_of_lists, and the second list contains the second element of each sublist in list_of_lists
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements. It then returns two lists. The first list contains the first element of each sublist in list_of_lists, and the second list contains the second element of each sublist in list_of_lists. The function correctly extracts and returns the elements as described in the annotations.
