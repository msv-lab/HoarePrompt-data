The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements. After executing the function body, the program returns two lists: 'first_elements' and 'second_elements'. 'first_elements' contains the first element of each sublist in 'list_of_lists', while 'second_elements' contains the second element of each sublist. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists where each sublist has two elements, and then return two lists: 'first_elements' and 'second_elements' containing the first and second elements of each sublist, respectively.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, returns lists 'first_elements' and 'second_elements' containing the first and second elements of each sublist in 'list_of_lists', respectively.**
