Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to correctly follow the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements, and it returns two lists. The first list contains the first element of each sublist, and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The code achieves this by using list comprehension to extract the first and second elements from each sublist and then returning these two lists. 
The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly extracting the elements as described in the problem description. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, and there are no apparent edge cases or scenarios where the code might fail, we can conclude that the code is correct.
