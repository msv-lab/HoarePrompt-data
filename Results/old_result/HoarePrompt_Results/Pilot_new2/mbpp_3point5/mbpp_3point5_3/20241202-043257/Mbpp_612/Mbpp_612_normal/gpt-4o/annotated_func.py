#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements.**
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    first_elements = [sublist[0] for sublist in list_of_lists]
    second_elements = [sublist[1] for sublist in list_of_lists]
    return [first_elements, second_elements]
    #The program returns lists 'first_elements' and 'second_elements' which contain the first and second elements of each sublist in 'list_of_lists' respectively
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. It then extracts the first and second elements of each sublist and returns them as separate lists 'first_elements' and 'second_elements'.
