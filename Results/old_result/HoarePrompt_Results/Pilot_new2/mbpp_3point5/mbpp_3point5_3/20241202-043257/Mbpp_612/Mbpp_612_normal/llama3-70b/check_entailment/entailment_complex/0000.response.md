Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by taking a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returning a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The program uses list comprehensions to achieve this and the annotations clearly explain the functionality of the code. The program always follows the problem description and correctly extracts and returns the elements from the input list of lists.
