Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct as it follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. It then extracts the first and second elements of each sublist and returns them as separate lists 'first_elements' and 'second_elements'. The code then returns a list of two lists, one containing all the first elements and the other containing all the second elements. The provided test cases also pass, indicating that the code is functioning as expected. The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implementing the described functionality.
