Correctness: False

The provided program is incorrect because it does not match the problem description. The program is supposed to count the occurrences of an element in a tuple, but the test cases provided are checking for counts of elements that are not in the tuple. For example, the first test case checks for the count of element 4, which is not present in the tuple. Since the program does not handle this case correctly, it is incorrect.
