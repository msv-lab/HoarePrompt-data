Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python function `func_1` correctly takes in a tuple and an element, and then counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple using the `count()` method. The test cases provided cover different scenarios such as when the element is not present in the tuple, when the element occurs multiple times in the tuple, and when the element occurs at the beginning, middle, and end of the tuple. All test cases pass successfully, indicating that the program works as expected and follows the problem description.
