Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program defines a function called `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and returns the count of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`. The function uses the `count` method of tuples in Python, which correctly counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple. This implementation meets the requirements of the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
