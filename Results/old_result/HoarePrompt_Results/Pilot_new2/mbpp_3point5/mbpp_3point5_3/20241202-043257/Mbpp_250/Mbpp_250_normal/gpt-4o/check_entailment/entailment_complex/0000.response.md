Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element, and returns the count of the element in the tuple using the `count` method of tuples. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires the function to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The program is concise and correctly implements the desired functionality without missing any edge cases. Hence, the program is correct.
