Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element, and then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the given element in the tuple. This exactly matches the problem description, which asks for a function that counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple. The program correctly implements this functionality.
