Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program defines a function `func_1` that accepts a complex number `num` and returns its polar coordinates (r, phi) using the `cmath` library.
- The initial assertions provided in the code test the function with input values 1, 4, and 5, and in all cases, the output matches the expected polar coordinates (r, phi) as (num, 0.0).
- The code aligns with the problem description and produces the correct output for the given test cases. There are no edge cases or scenarios identified where the code does not follow the problem description.
