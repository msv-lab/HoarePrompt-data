Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect. It is missing the import statement for the `cmath` module, which is needed to calculate the phase of a complex number. Without this import statement, the program will raise a `NameError` when trying to execute `cmath.phase(c)`.

Additionally, the program does not include the logic to handle the conversion of complex numbers to polar coordinates correctly. The correct way to convert a complex number to polar coordinates is to calculate the absolute value (magnitude) of the complex number and the phase angle.

Therefore, the program should be updated as follows:
```
import cmath

def func_1(c):
    return (abs(c), cmath.phase(c))
```

With these corrections, the program should work correctly for all potential cases.
