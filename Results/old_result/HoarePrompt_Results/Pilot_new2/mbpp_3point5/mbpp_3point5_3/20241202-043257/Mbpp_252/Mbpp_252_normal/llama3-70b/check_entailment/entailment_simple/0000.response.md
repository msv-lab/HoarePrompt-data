Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function that takes a complex number as input and returns its absolute value (magnitude) and phase (angle) in polar coordinates. This matches exactly with the problem description, which asks for a function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates. The program correctly computes the absolute value and phase of the complex number, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.
