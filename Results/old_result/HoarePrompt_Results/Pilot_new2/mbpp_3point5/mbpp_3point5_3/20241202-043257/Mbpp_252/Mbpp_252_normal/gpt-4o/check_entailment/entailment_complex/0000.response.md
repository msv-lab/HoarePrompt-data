Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number as input and returns its polar coordinates using the `cmath` library. The program matches the problem description as it accurately converts complex numbers to polar coordinates. The `cmath.polar()` function is specifically designed for this purpose, making the program correct.
