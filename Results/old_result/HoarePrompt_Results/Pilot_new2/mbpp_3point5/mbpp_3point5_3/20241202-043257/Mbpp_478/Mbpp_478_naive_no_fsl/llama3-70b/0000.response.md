Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function that takes a string as input and returns a new string with only the uppercase characters. This aligns with the problem description of removing lowercase substrings from the given string. The program uses a generator expression within the `join` method to filter out lowercase characters and concatenate the remaining uppercase characters into a new string. This logic covers all potential cases where the program could fail, so the program is correct.
