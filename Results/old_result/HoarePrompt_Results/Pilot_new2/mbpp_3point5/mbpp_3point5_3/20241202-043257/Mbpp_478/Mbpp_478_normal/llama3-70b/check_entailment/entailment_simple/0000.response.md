Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string `s`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. The program achieves this by using a generator expression to filter out lowercase characters and then joining the remaining uppercase characters to form the final string. It correctly removes lowercase substrings and preserves only the uppercase characters, thus meeting the requirements of the problem description.
