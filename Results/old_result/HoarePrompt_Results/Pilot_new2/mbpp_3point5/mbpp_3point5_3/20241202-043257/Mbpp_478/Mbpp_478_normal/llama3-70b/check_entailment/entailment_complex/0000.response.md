Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string that contains only the uppercase characters from the original string `s. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. Since the program only retains uppercase characters and discards lowercase characters, it effectively removes the lowercase substrings from the input string. Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
