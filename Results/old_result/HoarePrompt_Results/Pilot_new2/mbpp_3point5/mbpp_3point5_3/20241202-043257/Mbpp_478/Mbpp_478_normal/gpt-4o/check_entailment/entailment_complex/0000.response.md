Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string `s`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function that removes lowercase substrings from a given string. Since the program filters out lowercase characters and only retains uppercase characters, it effectively removes lowercase substrings as required. Hence, the program is correct.
