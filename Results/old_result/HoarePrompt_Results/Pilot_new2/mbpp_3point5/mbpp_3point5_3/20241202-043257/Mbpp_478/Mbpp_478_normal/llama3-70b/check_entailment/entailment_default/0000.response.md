Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code snippet provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string `s`. The code achieves this by using a generator expression within the `join` function to iterate over each character in the input string `s` and filter out the lowercase characters using the `isupper()` method. Since the description and the code perfectly align, and there are no potential cases mentioned where the code might fail to meet the requirements, we can conclude that the code is correct.
