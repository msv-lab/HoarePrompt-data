Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given Python program correctly removes all lowercase substrings from the input string by utilizing a generator expression to filter out lowercase characters using the `isupper()` method. It iterates through all characters in the input string `s` and only includes uppercase characters in the final result. This implementation aligns with the problem description, and it covers all potential cases where lowercase substrings need to be removed.
