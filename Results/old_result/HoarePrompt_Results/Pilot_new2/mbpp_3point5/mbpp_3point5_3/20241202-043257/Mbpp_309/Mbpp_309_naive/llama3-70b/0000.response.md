Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program defines a function that returns the maximum of two numbers using the built-in max() function, which correctly follows the problem description. For any input values of 'a' and 'b', the function will return the maximum value, thus meeting the requirements. There are no edge cases or scenarios where this program would fail to return the correct maximum value.
