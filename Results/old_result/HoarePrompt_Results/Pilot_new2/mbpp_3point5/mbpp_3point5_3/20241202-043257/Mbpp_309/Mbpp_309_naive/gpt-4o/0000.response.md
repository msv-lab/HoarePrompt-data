Correctness: **True**

The given Python program defines a function `func_1(a, b)` that returns the maximum of two numbers `a` and `b` using a ternary operator. The function then asserts the correctness of the function by comparing it with expected results for different input cases. 

For all the provided test cases:
1. `func_1(5, 10)` correctly returns `10` which is the maximum of the two numbers.
2. `func_1(-1, -2)` correctly returns `-1` which is the maximum of the two negative numbers.
3. `func_1(9, 7)` correctly returns `9` which is the maximum of the two numbers.

Since the program fulfills the requirements of finding the maximum of two numbers for all the provided test cases, the correctness of the program is **True**.
