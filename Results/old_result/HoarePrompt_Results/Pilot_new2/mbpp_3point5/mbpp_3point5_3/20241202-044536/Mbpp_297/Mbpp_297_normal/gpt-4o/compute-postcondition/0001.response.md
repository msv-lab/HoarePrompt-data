According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least one item, the loop will execute. Since the flat_list is empty initially, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the nested_list must have at least one item.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure that must have at least one item, flat_list is an empty list**
