Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that accepts a nested list as input and recursively flattens the nested list structure by applying the function to any nested lists within the input list. The function returns a flat list that contains all the items from the nested list after flattening the structure. The code correctly implements this functionality by checking if each item in the list is a list itself, and recursively calling `func_1` on those nested lists. The function then appends non-list items to the flat_list. The examples provided in the code also demonstrate the correct flattening of nested lists. Additionally, the output hints also confirm that the function is designed to recursively flatten any nested lists within the input list and return a flat list with all items. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct.
