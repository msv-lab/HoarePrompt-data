Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the function to flatten a nested list structure. It recursively checks each element in the nested list, if it encounters another list, it calls itself recursively until it reaches a non-list element. This process ensures that all nested lists are flattened into a single list as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements and is correct.
