Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the function `func_1` to flatten a given nested list structure. It recursively flattens the nested list structure by applying `func_1` to any nested lists within the `nested_list`. The function then returns a flat list that contains all the items from the `nested_list` after it has been flattened. The comments in the code clearly explain the state of the program before and after the function call, as well as the overall functionality of the function. The program meets the requirements specified in the problem description and is therefore correct.
