Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a nested list as input and recursively flattens the nested list structure to return a flat list containing all elements from the nested list. The code iterates over each element in the input list, and if the element is a list, it recursively calls the `func_1` function on that element. If the element is not a list, it appends the element to the `flat_list`. This logic aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires flattening a nested list structure. The code handles nested lists correctly and returns a flat list as expected. The code also does not have any edge cases that it is not handling, and the output hints agree with the code's functionality. Overall, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
