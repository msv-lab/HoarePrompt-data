Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a nested list as input and recursively flattens the nested list structure to return a flat list containing all elements. The program correctly handles nested lists by using recursion to flatten any nested lists within the input list. The function follows the problem description accurately, as it indeed flattens a given nested list structure. Therefore, the program is correct.
