The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of any data type. After executing the function body, the program returns a list containing elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both, sorted based on their index in the combined list of `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists `list1` and `list2`, and return a new list containing elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both, sorted based on their index in the combined list. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, list1 and list2, and returns a new list containing elements that are in either list1 or list2 but not in both, sorted based on their index in the combined list.**
