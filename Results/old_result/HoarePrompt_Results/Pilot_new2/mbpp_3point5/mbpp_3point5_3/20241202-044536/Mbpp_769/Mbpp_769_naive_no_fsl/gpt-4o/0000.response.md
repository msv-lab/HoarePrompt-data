Correctness: False

The provided program is incorrect because it does not return the elements that are present in one list but not in the other. Instead, it returns the symmetric difference between the two lists, which includes elements that are present in one list or the other, but not both.

For example, if we test the program with the following input:
```
assert func_1([1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1]) == [2, 3, 6, 7]
```
The expected output should be [2, 3, 6, 7], as 2 and 3 are present in the first list but not in the second list, and 6 and 7 are present in the second list but not in the first list. However, the actual output of the program will be different as it calculates the symmetric difference instead of the difference between the two lists.
