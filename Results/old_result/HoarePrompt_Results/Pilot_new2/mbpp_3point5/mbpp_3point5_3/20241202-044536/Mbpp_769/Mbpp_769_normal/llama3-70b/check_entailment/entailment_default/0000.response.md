Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the function to get the difference between two lists. It takes two lists, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted list of unique elements that are present in either list1 or list2 but not in both. The code uses the XOR operator `^` with set operations to achieve this, which is an efficient way to find the symmetric difference between two lists. The code also sorts the final result before returning it, as expected in the problem description. There are no edge cases or scenarios identified where the code would not work as described. The output hints also align with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
