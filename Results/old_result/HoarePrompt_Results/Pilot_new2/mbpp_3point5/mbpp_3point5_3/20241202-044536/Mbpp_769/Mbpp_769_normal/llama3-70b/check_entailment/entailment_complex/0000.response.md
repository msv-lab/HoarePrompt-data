Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description by using the symmetric difference operation between two lists. The `set` data type is used to get unique elements from each list, then the `^` operator is used to perform the symmetric difference, and finally the `sorted` function is applied to get a sorted list of the unique elements that are present in either list1 or list2 but not in both. This approach ensures that the program returns the desired output as described in the problem statement.
