Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two lists, list1 and list2, converts them into sets, finds the symmetric difference between the sets, converts the result back to a list, and sorts the list based on the index of elements in the combined list of list1 and list2. The function then returns this sorted list of elements that are present in either list1 or list2 but not in both. **
