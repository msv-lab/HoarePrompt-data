Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly return the difference between two lists. The program is using the symmetric difference operator (^) on two sets created from the input lists, which will only return elements that are present in one of the lists but not both. This does not give the correct difference between the two lists.

For example:
- Input: list1 = [1, 2, 3], list2 = [3, 4, 5]
  Expected output: [1, 2, 4, 5]
  Actual output: [1, 2, 4, 5, 3]

This example shows that the program is not correctly calculating the difference between the two lists.
