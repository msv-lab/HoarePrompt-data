The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. The parameter `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are strings (student names) and values are tuples of two floats (student_height, student_weight). The parameters `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively.

After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The input `student_dict` is a dictionary with keys as student names and values as tuples of height and weight.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary `student_dict` with student names and tuples of height and weight, along with minimum height `min_height` and minimum weight `min_weight`. It then returns a filtered dictionary with only the students meeting the height and weight criteria specified. 
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters student_dict, min_height, and min_weight. It returns a dictionary with only the students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.**
