Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a dictionary student_dict, and two floats min_height and min_weight. It then filters the student_dict to include only students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight. The function returns a new dictionary with the filtered students. However, if the student_dict is empty or if the keys in student_dict are not strings or if the values in student_dict are not tuples of two floats, the function might not behave as expected.**
