Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in a dictionary `student_data` where each key is a student name and the corresponding value is a tuple of two floats (student_height, student_weight). It then filters the student data based on the criteria that the student's height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, returning a new dictionary with the filtered student information. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and there are no edge cases identified where the program does not work as expected. The output hints also align with the code functionality.
