The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_data` is a dictionary where each key is a student name and the corresponding value is a tuple of two floats (student_height, student_weight). `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimal height and minimal weight respectively. 

After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary where each key is a student name and the corresponding value is a tuple of two floats (student_height, student_weight) for students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary `student_data` containing student names and their corresponding height-weight tuples, as well as the minimal height and minimal weight values. It then filters out and returns a new dictionary with students who meet the criteria of having height greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight greater than or equal to `min_weight`.
