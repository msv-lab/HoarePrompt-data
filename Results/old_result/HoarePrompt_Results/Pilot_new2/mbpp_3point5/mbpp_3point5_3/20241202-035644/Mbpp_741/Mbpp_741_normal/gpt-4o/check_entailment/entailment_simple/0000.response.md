Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and checks whether all the characters in the string are the same. It first checks if the string is empty, and if it is, it returns True as there are no characters to compare. 

Then, it initializes `first_char` to be the first character of the string `s`, and iterates through each character in the string. If any character is found that is different from `first_char`, it immediately returns False, indicating that not all characters are the same. If the loop completes without finding any differing characters, it returns True, indicating that all characters in the string are the same.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description as it correctly checks whether all characters in the string are the same and returns True if they are and False if they are not.
