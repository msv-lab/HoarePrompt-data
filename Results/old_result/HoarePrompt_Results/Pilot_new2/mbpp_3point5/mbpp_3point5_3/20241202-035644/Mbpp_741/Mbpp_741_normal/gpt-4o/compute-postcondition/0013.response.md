Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string containing characters. The first character of `s` is `first_char`, and `char` is also equal to `first_char`. If `char` is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `s`, `first_char`, and `char`.***
