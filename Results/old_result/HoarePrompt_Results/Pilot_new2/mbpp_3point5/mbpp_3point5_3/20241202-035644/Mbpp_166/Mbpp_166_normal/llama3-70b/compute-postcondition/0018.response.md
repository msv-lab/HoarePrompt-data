According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is updated after each pair `(i, j)` where XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, `i` is 1, and `j` is the last index of `nums`. Since the loop will execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is updated after each pair (i, j) where XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, `i` is 1, and `j` is the last index of `nums` incremented by 1**
