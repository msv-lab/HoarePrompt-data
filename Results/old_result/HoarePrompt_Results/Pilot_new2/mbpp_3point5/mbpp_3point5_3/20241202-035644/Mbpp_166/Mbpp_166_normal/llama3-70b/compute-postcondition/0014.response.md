According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is in the range from `i + 1` to the last index of `nums`. Since `i` is 1 and `j` is the last index of `nums`, the loop can execute. The condition that `nums` has at least 1 element ensures that the loop can start. At the start of the loop, `count` is the total number of pairs of elements (i, j) in the list `nums` such that the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `count` must be updated after each pair (i, j) where XOR results in an even number.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is updated after each pair (i, j) where XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, `i` is 1, `j` is the last index of `nums`**
