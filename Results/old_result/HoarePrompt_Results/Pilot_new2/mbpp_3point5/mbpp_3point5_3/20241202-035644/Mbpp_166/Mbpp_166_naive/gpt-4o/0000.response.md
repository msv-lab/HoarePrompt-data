Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in the list that xor to an even number. It first calculates the count of even and odd numbers in the list, then calculates the number of pairs that can be formed using these even and odd counts. The function passes all the provided test cases and the logic is sound, making it correct for all potential cases.
