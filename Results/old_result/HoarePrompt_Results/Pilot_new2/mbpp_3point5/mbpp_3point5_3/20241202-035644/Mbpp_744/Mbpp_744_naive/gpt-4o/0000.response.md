Correctness: **True**

I believe the provided program is correct for the given problem description. The function iterates through the tuple elements and checks if any of them is `None`. If it encounters a `None` value, it immediately returns `True`, indicating that the tuple has a `None` value. If no `None` value is found, it returns `False`, indicating that the tuple does not have any `None` values. 

The program has been tested with multiple test cases, and it correctly identifies whether the given tuple contains a `None` value or not in all cases. Hence, the correctness of the program is **True**.
