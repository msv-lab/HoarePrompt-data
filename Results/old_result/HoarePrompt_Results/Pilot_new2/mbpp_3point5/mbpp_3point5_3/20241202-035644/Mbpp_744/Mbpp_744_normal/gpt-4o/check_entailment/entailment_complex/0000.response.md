Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and checks if there are any `None` values in the tuple. It iterates through the elements of the tuple and if it encounters a `None` value, it returns `True`. If there are no `None` values in the tuple, it returns `False`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which asks for a function to check if the given tuple has any `None` value or not. The program handles all potential cases correctly and returns the expected output.
