The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple. After executing the function body, the program can return True in multiple cases. In Case 1, Case 2, and Case 3, the program returns True. However, in Case 4, the program returns False. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return True in multiple cases based on the input tuple values.
Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and returns True in multiple cases, and False in another case.**
