Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems correct and follows the problem description. The function func_1 accepts a tuple `tup` and returns True if any element in the tuple is None. Otherwise, it returns False. The code uses the any() function along with a generator expression to check if any element in the tuple is None. This logic aligns with the given problem description. Additionally, there are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that the code does not handle. Hence, the code is correct.
