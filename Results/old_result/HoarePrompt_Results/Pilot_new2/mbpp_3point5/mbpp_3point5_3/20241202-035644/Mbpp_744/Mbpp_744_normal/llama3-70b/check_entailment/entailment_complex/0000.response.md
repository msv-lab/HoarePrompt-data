Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input and uses the `any()` function along with a generator expression to check if any element in the tuple is `None`. If any element is `None`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which requires checking if the given tuple has any `None` value. The program accurately implements this logic and meets the requirements of the problem description.
