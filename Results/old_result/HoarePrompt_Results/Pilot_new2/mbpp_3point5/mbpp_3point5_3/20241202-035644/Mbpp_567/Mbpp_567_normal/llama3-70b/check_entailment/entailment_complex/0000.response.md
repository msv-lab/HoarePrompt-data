Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function func_1 that takes a list of comparable elements and returns True if all elements in the list are in non-descending order (each element is less than or equal to the next element), and False otherwise. The function achieves this by using a generator expression in the return statement to check if each element is less than or equal to the next element in the list.

The program follows the problem description accurately by checking if the list is sorted in non-descending order. It does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-comparable elements, and it also does not check for the edge case where the list has only one element, as mentioned in the annotations. This meets the requirements of the problem description, making the program correct.
