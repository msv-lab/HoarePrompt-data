According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `lst`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `lst` being a list of comparable elements does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `lst` is a list of at least 2 comparable elements. Additionally, the variable `i` will start at 0.
State: **`lst` is a list of at least 2 comparable elements, `i` is 0**
