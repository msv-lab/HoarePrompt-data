The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of comparable elements. It iterates through the list and checks if the elements are in non-decreasing order. If the elements are in non-decreasing order, it returns True. If there is only one element in the list, the function returns True without executing the loop. If the loop finds a pair of elements that are out of order, it returns False. However, the function does not handle the case where the list is empty, so it may lead to unexpected behavior if an empty list is passed as input.
