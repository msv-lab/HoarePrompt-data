#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list of comparable elements.**
def func_1(lst):

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, if there are at least 2 elements in the list `lst`, then the elements in `lst` are in non-decreasing order. If there is only one element in `lst`, the loop does not execute. If the loop executes and finds a pair of elements that are out of order, it returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True if the elements in list `lst` are in non-decreasing order after the loop executes. If there is only one element in `lst`, the loop does not execute. If the loop executes and finds a pair of elements that are out of order, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of comparable elements. It iterates through the list and checks if the elements are in non-decreasing order. If the elements are in non-decreasing order, it returns True. If there is only one element in the list, the function returns True without executing the loop. If the loop finds a pair of elements that are out of order, it returns False. However, the function does not handle the case where the list is empty, so it may lead to unexpected behavior if an empty list is passed as input.
