The function func_1 accepts a list of comparable elements and returns True if all elements in the list are in non-descending order (each element is less than or equal to the next element). Otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle cases where the input list is empty or contains non-comparable elements, such as objects of different types. It also does not check for the edge case where the list has only one element.
