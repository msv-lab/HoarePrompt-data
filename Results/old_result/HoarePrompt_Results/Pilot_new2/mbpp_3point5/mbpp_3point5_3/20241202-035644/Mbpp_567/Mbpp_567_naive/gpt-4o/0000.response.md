Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program is incorrect because it only checks the immediate neighbor in the list to determine if it is sorted or not. It does not consider the entire list for sorting order. 

For example, when the input list is `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 15, 14, 20]`, the program will return True since the immediate neighbors `15` and `14` are in ascending order. However, the list is not entirely sorted as `14` should not come after `15`.
