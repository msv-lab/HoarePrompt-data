Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program defines a function is_prime to check if a number is prime or not.
2. It then iterates through all numbers from 2 to n (excluding n) and counts the prime numbers.
3. The program correctly returns the count of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
4. The logic is correct and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
