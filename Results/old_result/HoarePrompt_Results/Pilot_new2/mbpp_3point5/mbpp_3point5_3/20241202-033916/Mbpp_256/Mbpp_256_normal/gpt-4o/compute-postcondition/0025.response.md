According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i`. In this case, `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, so the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the values of `i`, `n`, and `is_prime` need to be adjusted to ensure the loop executes. 

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values except for `is_prime[0] = False` and `is_prime[1] = False`, `i` is 4, `j` is `i * i = 16`.**
