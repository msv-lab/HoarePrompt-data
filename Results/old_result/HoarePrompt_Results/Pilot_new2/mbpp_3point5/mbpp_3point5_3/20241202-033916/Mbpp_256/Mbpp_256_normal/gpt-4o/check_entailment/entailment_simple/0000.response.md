Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes in a non-negative number `n` and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. The program efficiently finds all prime numbers up to the square root of `n` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and then counts the number of prime numbers found. This method ensures that the program returns the correct count of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n` for all potential cases.
