According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer, `num` is greater than or equal to 4, and `num` is not divisible by `i`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Since `i` starts from 2, the next value of `i` would be the current value of `i` + 1. Therefore, the next value of `i` would be `i` + 1.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer, `num` is greater than or equal to 4, `num` is not divisible by `i + 1`**
