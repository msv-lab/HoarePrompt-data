Output State: **If the loop executes, then `num` is a non-negative integer and a prime number, as the loop checks for divisibility from 2 to the square root of `num`. If the loop does not execute, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4 and is not divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `num`.**
