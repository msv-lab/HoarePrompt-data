Output State: `n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values, `is_prime[0] = False`, `is_prime[1] = False`, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than `i * i`, `is_prime[i]` is False, `j` is the next value after the last iteration, `is_prime[j]` is False, Next value after `j` within the range of `i * i` to `n` must have `is_prime` as False. The value of `is_prime[j]` is updated to `False`.
