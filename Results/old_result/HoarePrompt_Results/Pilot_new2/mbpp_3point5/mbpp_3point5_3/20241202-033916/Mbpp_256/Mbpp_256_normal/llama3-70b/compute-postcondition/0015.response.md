The function `is_prime` accepts a non-negative integer parameter `num`. After executing the function body, the program can return either False for Cases 1 to 4 or True for Case 5, which implies that `num` is a non-negative prime number. Therefore, the functionality of the function is_prime is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and determine if it is a prime number, returning True if it is prime and False otherwise.
