Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the function `func_1` that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. The program first checks if the input number `n` is less than or equal to 2, in which case it returns 0 as expected. 

For numbers greater than 2, the program correctly uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers in a list `is_prime`. It iterates through numbers up to the square root of `n` and marks multiples of prime numbers as `False`. Finally, it returns the sum of the remaining `True` values in the `is_prime` list, which corresponds to the number of prime numbers less than `n`.

The program always follows the problem description and correctly counts the prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.
