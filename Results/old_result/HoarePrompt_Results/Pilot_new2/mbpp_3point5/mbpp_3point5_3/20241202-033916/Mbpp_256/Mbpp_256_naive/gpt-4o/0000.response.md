Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. It uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to efficiently mark off multiples of prime numbers. The program then sums up the boolean list of prime numbers to get the count of prime numbers less than the given number. The program has been tested with example cases where it returns the expected results, indicating that it works as described in the problem statement.
