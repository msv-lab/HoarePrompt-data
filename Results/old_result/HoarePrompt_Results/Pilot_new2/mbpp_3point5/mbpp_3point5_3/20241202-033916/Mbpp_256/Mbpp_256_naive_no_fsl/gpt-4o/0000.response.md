Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number for all the test cases provided. It generates a list of boolean values to mark prime and non-prime numbers, then iterates through the list to mark the multiples of each prime number as non-prime. Finally, it returns the sum of the boolean list, which corresponds to the count of prime numbers. The logic is sound and the program produces the expected results for the provided test cases.
