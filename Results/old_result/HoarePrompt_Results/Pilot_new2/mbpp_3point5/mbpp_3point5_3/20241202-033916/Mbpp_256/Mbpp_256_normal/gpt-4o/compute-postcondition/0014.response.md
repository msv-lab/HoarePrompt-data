Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer larger than 2, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` filled with `True` values, `is_prime[0] = False`, `is_prime[1] = False`, `i` is 2. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then `is_prime[i]` is set to False, and all multiples of `i` from `i * i` to `n` are marked as `False` in `is_prime`.***
