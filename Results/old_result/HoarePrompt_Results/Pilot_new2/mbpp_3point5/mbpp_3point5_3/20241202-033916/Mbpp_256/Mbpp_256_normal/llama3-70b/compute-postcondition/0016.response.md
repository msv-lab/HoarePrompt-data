Functionality: The function `is_prime` accepts a non-negative integer parameter `num` and determines if it is a prime number. It returns False if `num` is less than 2 or if it is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `num`. If the loop does not execute, the function returns True, indicating that `num` is a non-negative prime number. The missing functionality in the annotations is handling the case where `num` is 2, which should return True since 2 is a prime number.
