Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in two non-negative integer parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`. The function then checks if the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`, and returns True if they are equal, otherwise, it returns False. This logic correctly aligns with the problem description. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where the input values are negative or not integers, which is fine as the problem description does not specify to handle such cases. 

Upon reviewing the output hints, they confirm that the function should return True if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`, and False otherwise. The hints are consistent with the code and do not introduce any additional conditions.

Overall, the code follows the problem description for all potential cases provided, as it accurately checks for the condition specified and returns the expected output.
