Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that checks if the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`. This aligns with the problem description which requires the function to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss. The program returns True only if the cost_price is equal to the selling_price, which means there is no profit or loss. The program explicitly states that it does not handle cases where cost_price or selling_price are not integers or negative values, which is fine as the problem description does not require handling such cases. Therefore, the program is correct as it performs the required task as specified in the problem description.
