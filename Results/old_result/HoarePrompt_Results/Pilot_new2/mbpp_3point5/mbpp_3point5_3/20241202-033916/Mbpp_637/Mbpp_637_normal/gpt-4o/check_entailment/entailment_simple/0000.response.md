Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price, as stated in the problem description. If the cost price is equal to the selling price, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. This behavior aligns with the requirement of determining if there is no profit and no loss. Therefore, the program meets the problem description and is correct.
