Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder based on the provided formulas for the volume of a cylinder given the radius and height. The assertions in the code are checking the calculated volume against expected values with a relative tolerance of 0.001, which accounts for any small differences due to floating-point arithmetic. The program is simple and straightforward, and the calculations are correct for the given inputs.
