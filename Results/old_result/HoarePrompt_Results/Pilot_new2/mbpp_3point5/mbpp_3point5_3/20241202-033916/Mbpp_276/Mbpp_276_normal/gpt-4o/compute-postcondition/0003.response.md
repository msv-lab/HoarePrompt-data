Functionality: **The function `func_1` calculates the volume of a cylinder given the `radius` and `height` as non-negative numbers by using the formula `volume = math.pi * radius^2 * height`. The function returns the calculated volume. However, the function assumes that the `math` module has been imported for the calculation.**
