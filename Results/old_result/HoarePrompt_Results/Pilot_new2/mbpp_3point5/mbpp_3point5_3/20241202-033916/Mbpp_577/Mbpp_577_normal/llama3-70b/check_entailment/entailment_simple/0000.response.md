Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The provided program does not actually find the last digit in the factorial of a given number as stated in the problem description. Instead, it only checks the value of the input number `n` and returns different values based on specific conditions. It does not compute the factorial nor find the last digit of the factorial.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is considered incorrect.
