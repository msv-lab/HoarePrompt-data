Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0 as specified in the problem description. If `n` is less than 5, the function correctly calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial.

The program has been annotated to show the state of the program at different points, making it clear that the function returns the correct output based on the value of `n`. The program has two cases that cover all possible scenarios:

1. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, it returns 0.
2. If `n` is less than 5, it calculates the factorial and returns the last digit.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and correctly implements the required functionality.
