Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a non-negative integer `n` as input.
- If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function immediately returns 0 as the last digit of the factorial will always be 0 for numbers greater than or equal to 5.
- If `n` is less than 5, the function correctly calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial using the modulo operator.
- The code covers both cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the expected output for each case. 
- The output hints align with the code behavior and further confirm that the code is correct for the specified problem.
