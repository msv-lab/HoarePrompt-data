Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number as per the problem description. The program only returns a fixed value based on the input number, rather than calculating the factorial and determining the last digit. For example, if we input 5, the factorial of 5 is 120, and the last digit is 0. However, the program will return 0 for any input greater than 4, which is incorrect.
