Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as parameters. It then concatenates the elements of the tuple `tup` to the list `lst` and returns the result as a new list. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to add the elements of a given tuple to a given list. The program consistently does what the problem description asks for every potential case.
