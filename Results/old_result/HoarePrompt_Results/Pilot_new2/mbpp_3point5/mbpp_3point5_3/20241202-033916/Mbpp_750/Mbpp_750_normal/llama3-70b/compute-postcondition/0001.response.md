The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list and `tup`, which is a tuple. After executing the function body, the program returns the concatenation of list `lst` and the elements of tuple `tup` as a new list. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and return the concatenation of `lst` with the elements of `tup` as a new list.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and returns the concatenation of `lst` with the elements of `tup` as a new list.**
