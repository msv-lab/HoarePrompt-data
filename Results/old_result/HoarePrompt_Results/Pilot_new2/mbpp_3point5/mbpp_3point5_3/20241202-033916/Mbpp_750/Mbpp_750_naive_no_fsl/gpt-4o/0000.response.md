Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input and returns a new list by concatenating the elements of `lst` and the elements of `tpl` converted to a list. The assert statements provided in the code verify that the function works correctly by adding the tuple elements to the list as expected. The function implementation is simple and straightforward, and for all the given cases, it correctly adds the tuple elements to the list. Therefore, the program is correct.
