#State of the program right berfore the function call: lst is a list and tpl is a tuple.**
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
    #The program returns the concatenation of list `lst` and the elements of tuple `tpl` converted into a list
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl` after converting the tuple elements into a list.
