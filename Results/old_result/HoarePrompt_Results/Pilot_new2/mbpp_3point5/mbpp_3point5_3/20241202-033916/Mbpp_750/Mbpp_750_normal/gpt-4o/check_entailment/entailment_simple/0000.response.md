Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as inputs. It then concatenates the elements of the list `lst` with the elements of the tuple `tpl` after converting the tuple into a list using the `list()` function. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to add the given tuple to the given list. The program achieves this by combining the list and tuple elements into a single list. Thus, the program is correct as it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
