Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input. The function then returns the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl` after converting the tuple elements into a list.

This implementation meets the problem description as it correctly adds the elements of the tuple to the given list by converting the tuple to a list first. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description.
