Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The code provided correctly follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements. It then returns two listsâ€”one containing the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists` and the other containing the second element of each sublist. The code achieves this by using list comprehensions to extract the first and second elements of each sublist, which aligns perfectly with the problem description. 

There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description which are not handled by the code. The code seems to be following the problem requirements accurately. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that it is correctly implementing the desired functionality.
