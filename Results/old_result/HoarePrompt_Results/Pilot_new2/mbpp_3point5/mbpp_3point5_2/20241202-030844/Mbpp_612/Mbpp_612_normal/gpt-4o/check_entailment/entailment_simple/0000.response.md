Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input. It then creates two separate lists `first_elements` and `second_elements` by extracting the first and second elements from each sublist in the input list of lists. Finally, it returns a list containing `first_elements` and `second_elements`, which is exactly what the problem description asks for.

The program always correctly extracts the first and second elements from each sublist and returns them as two separate lists. Therefore, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases.
