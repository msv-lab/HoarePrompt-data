Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a complex number `c` as input and returns the absolute value of the complex number using `abs(c)` and the phase of the complex number using `cmath.phase(c)`. This aligns perfectly with the problem description of converting complex numbers to polar coordinates, where the absolute value represents the magnitude (r) and the phase represents the angle (theta) in polar coordinates. Therefore, the program is correct as it fulfills the requirements of the problem description.
