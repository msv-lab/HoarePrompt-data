The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a complex number. After executing the function body, the program returns the polar coordinates of the complex number `num` as a tuple (r, phi), where `r` is the magnitude and `phi` is the phase angle in radians. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a complex number `num` and return its polar coordinates as a tuple. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a complex number `num` and returns its polar coordinates as a tuple (r, phi) where r is the magnitude and phi is the phase angle in radians.**
