Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string by joining only the uppercase characters from the input string. This aligns with the problem description of removing lowercase substrings from the given string. The code uses a generator expression to iterate over the characters in the input string and only includes the uppercase characters in the output string. This logic covers all potential cases where lowercase substrings need to be removed, making the code correct.
