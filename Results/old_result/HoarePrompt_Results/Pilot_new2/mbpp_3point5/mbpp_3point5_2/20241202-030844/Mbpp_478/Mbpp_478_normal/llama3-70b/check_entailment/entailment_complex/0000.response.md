Correctness: **True**

The program meets the requirements of the problem description. It takes a string as input and returns a new string that consists of only the uppercase characters from the input string. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for lowercase substrings to be removed. Since the program only keeps the uppercase characters, it effectively removes the lowercase substrings from the given string. Therefore, the program is correct.
