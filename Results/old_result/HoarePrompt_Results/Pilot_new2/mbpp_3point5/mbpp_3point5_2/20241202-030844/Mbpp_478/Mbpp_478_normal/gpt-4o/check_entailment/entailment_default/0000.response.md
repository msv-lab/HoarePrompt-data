Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string that consists of only the uppercase characters from the original string `s`. The code uses list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `s` and only includes the character in the output string if it is an uppercase character. The code seems to be following the problem description correctly for all potential cases. There are no edge cases identified where the code does not meet the given requirements. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the code is correct.
