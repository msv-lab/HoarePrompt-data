Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string that consists of only the uppercase characters from the original string `s`, which aligns with the problem description of removing lowercase substrings from a given string. The list comprehension `[char for char in s if char.isupper()]` correctly filters out lowercase characters from the input string `s` and only keeps the uppercase characters, which is the desired behavior according to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
