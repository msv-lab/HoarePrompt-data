Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly takes in a tuple and an element, then counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple using the `count` method. The three assertions provided in the program seem to cover different scenarios - checking if the element is not present in the tuple, checking if the element occurs multiple times in the tuple, and checking if the element occurs at the beginning, middle, or end of the tuple. All these cases seem to be handled correctly by the function, making it a correct implementation based on the problem description.
