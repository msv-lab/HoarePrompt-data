Correctness: **True**

The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem` as input. It then uses the `count` method of tuples in Python to count the occurrences of the element `elem` in the tuple `tup` and returns this count.

This implementation accurately counts the occurrences of the element in the tuple, which aligns with the problem description. The program covers all potential cases and edge cases for counting the occurrences of the element in the tuple, making it correct.
