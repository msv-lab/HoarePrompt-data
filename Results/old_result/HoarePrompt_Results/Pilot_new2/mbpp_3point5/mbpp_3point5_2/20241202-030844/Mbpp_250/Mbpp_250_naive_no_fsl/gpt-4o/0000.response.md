Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function that takes in a tuple and an element, then uses the `count` method of tuples to count the occurrences of the given element in the tuple. The provided test cases cover the scenarios where the element is not present in the tuple, where the element appears multiple times in the tuple, and where the element appears at least once in the tuple. The program correctly handles these scenarios, so it is considered correct.
