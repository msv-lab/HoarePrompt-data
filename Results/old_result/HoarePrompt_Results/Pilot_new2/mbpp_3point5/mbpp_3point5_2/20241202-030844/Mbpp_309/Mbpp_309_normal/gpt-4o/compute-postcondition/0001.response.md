The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are both integers. The function compares the values of `a` and `b`, and returns the larger integer between the two. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and return the larger integer between them.
Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the larger integer between them.**
