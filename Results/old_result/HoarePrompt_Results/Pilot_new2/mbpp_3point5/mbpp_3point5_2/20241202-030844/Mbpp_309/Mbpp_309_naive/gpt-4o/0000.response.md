Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters `a` and `b` and returns the maximum of the two numbers using a ternary operator. The function is then tested with multiple test cases using the `assert` statements. The logic of returning the maximum of two numbers is implemented correctly and all the test cases pass as expected. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that are not handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
