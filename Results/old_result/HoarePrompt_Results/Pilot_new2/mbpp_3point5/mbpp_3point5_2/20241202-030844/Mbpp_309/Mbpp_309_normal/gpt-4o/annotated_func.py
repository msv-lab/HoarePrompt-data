#State of the program right berfore the function call: a and b are integers.**
def func_1(a, b):
    return a if a > b else b
    #The program returns the larger integer between 'a' and 'b', where 'a' and 'b' are integers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the larger integer between them. If `a` is equal to `b`, it will return `a`.
