Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program defines a function that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum value between them using the built-in `max()` function. This aligns with the problem description which asks for a function to find the maximum of two numbers. The program always returns the correct maximum value between the two integers provided, making it correct.
