Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly iterates through the array using `enumerate` to check if the element is present in the array. If the element is found, it returns a tuple with the boolean value `True` and the index of the element. If the element is not found, it returns a tuple with the boolean value `False` and -1. The test cases provided cover different scenarios and the function returns the expected output in each case. Therefore, the program is correct.
