Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `index` is the index of the second element, and `value` is the value of the second element. If the `value` is equal to the second element in the list `arr`, the function returns True and updates the `index` variable to represent the index of the second element. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
