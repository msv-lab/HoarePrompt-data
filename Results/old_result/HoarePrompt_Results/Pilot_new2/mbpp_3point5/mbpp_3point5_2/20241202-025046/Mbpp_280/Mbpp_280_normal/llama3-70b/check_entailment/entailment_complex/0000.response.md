Correctness: **True**

The program is correct because it follows the problem description accurately. It takes in an array and an element, iterates through the array to find the first occurrence of the element, and returns a tuple with a boolean indicating if the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found). The annotations provided also confirm that the function behaves as described in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements.
