Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a list `arr` and an `element`. It then iterates through the elements of the list using `enumerate` and checks if any element is equal to the given `element`. If a match is found, it returns True along with the index of that element. If no match is found, it returns False and -1 as the index value.

This implementation aligns perfectly with the problem description, as it accurately determines whether the element is present in the array and returns the correct index if it exists. The program covers all potential cases, ensuring that it meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
