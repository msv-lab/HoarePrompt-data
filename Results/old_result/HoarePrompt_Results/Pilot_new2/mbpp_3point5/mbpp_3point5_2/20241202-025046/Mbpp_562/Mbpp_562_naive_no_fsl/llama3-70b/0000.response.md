Correctness: True

Explanation: The given Python program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist in the input list. The program achieves this by using a generator expression to iterate through each sublist in the input list and then finding the length of each sublist using the `len()` function. Finally, it returns the maximum length using the `max()` function. This logic correctly implements the problem description and should work for all potential cases.
