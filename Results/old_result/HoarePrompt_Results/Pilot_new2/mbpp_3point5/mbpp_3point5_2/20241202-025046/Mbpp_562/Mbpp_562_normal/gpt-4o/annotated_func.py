#State of the program right berfore the function call: list_of_lists is a list of lists.**
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    max_length = 0
    for sublist in list_of_lists:
        if len(sublist) > max_length:
            max_length = len(sublist)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist. `max_length` is updated to the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`
    return max_length
    #The program returns the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists. It iterates through the sublists to find the maximum length and returns that value as the maximum length of the sublists in `list_of_lists`.
