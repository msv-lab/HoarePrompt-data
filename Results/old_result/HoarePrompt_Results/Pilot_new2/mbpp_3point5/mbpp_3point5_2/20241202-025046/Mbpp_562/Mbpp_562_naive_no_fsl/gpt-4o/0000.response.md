Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly finds the length of the longest sublists in the given list of lists for all the provided test cases. It iterates through each sublist and updates the `max_length` variable if it encounters a sublist with a greater length. The assert statements also validate the correctness of the program for the given test cases.
