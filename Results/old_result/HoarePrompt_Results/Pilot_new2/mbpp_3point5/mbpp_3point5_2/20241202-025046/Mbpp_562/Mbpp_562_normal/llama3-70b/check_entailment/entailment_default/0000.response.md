Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to follow the problem description as it defines a function `func_1` that accepts a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist within the list of lists. The code uses a generator expression to calculate the length of each sublist and then returns the maximum length. Since there are no specific edge cases mentioned in the problem description and the code logic seems to align with the requirements, the code is deemed correct. 

The output hints also support the correctness of the code by stating that the function returns the length of the longest sublist within the list of lists 'lists'. Therefore, based on both the code and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct and meets the problem description.
