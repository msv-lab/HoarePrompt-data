According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list_of_lists. If the list has at least 2 sublists, the loop executes again for the second time. At the end of the last iteration, list_of_lists has at least 1 sublist and max_length is updated to the length of the sublist. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list_of_lists must have at least 2 sublists.
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 sublists, `max_length` is updated to the length of the sublist in the previous iteration**
