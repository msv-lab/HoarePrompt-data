Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist within the list of lists. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which states that the function should find the length of the longest sublist.

Additionally, the program correctly uses the `max` function to find the length of the longest sublist in the list of lists, fulfilling the requirements of the problem description. 

Overall, the program is correct as it follows the problem description and provides the expected functionality.
