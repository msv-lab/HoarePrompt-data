According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `list_of_lists`. If the list has at least 1 sublist, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `max_length` being 0 does not ensure the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `list_of_lists` having at least 1 sublist. 
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist, `max_length` is 0**
