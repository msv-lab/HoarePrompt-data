Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists that must have at least 1 sublist with the current value of `max_length` being 0. If the length of the sublist is greater than `max_length`, then the current value of the length of the sublist is greater than `max_length. `max_length` is assigned the value of `len(sublist)`.**
