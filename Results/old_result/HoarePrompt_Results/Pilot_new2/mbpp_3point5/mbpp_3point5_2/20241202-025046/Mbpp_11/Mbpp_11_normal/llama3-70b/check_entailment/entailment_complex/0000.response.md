Correctness: **False**

The given program does not completely meet the requirements of the problem description. While it does remove the first and last occurrence of the given character, it incorrectly includes the characters between the first and last occurrence in the final result. The problem description only asks for the character at the first and last occurrence to be removed.

Therefore, the program does not strictly adhere to the problem description and is considered incorrect.
