Correctness: **True**

I have reviewed the provided function `func_1` and tested it with the given test cases. The function accurately removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string as described in the problem description. Additionally, the function handles scenarios where the character is not found in the string or when only one occurrence of the character is present. Since the function works correctly for all the provided test cases and covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, it can be considered correct.
