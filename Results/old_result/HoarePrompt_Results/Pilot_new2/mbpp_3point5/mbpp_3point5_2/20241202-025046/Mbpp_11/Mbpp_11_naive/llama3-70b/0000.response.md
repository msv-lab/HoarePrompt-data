Correctness: **False**

The given program fails to handle the case where the given character appears only once in the string. In such a scenario, the function will remove the character at the first occurrence but not at the last occurrence as expected. This results in incorrect behavior for this specific case. 

For example, consider the input string "hello" and the character 'o'. The expected output should be "hell", removing the first and last occurrences of 'o'. However, the program will output "hell" by only removing the first occurrence, not the last one.
