Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The annotated program accurately follows the problem description. It correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. The program first finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of the character in the string. If the character is not found or the first and last occurrences are the same, it returns the original string. Otherwise, it constructs a new string by excluding the character at the first and last indices. This implementation satisfies the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
