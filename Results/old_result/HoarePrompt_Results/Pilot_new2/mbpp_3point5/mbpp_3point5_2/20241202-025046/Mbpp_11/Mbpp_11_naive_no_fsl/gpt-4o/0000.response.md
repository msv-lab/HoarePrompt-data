Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function that successfully removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the input string. It correctly identifies the first and last index of the character using the `find()` and `rfind()` functions. The slicing operation is then performed to remove the character from the string. The test cases provided cover different scenarios and the program produces the expected output for each case. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
