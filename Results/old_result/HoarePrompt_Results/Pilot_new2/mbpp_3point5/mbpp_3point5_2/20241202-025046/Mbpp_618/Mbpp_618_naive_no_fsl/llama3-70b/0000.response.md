Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not completely follow the problem description. The program will raise a `ValueError` only when the lengths of the two input lists are not equal. However, the problem description specifies that the program should divide two lists element-wise, but it does not handle the case where the denominator might be 0. In this case, the division operation will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` instead of properly handling it. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases.
