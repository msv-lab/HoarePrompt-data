Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists as input and returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from the two input lists. The program then asserts the output of the function for three different test cases, and in each case, the output matches the expected result as mentioned in the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
