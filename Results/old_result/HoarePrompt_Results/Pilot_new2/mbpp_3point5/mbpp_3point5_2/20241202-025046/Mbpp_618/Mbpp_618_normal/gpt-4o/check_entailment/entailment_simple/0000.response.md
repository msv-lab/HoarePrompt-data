Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two input lists `list1` and `list2`, both containing integers of the same length. It then uses a list comprehension and the `zip` function to iterate through the elements of both lists and divide the corresponding elements. Finally, it returns a new list containing the results of the division.

The program meets the requirements of the problem description as it divides two lists element-wise and returns a new list with the results. Since it explicitly states that both input lists are guaranteed to have the same length, there are no edge cases where the program would not follow the problem description.
