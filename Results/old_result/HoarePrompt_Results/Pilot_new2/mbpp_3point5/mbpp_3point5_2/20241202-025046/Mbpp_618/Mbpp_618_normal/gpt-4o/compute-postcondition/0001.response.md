The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of integers with the same length. After executing the function body, the program returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from `list1` by `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists of integers with the same length, perform element-wise division between the corresponding elements of the two lists, and return a new list with the results of the division. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists of integers with the same length and returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from list1 by list2.**
