You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
I am now giing you the problem description. This is what the function must do.
PROBLEM DESCRIPTION: Write a function to divide two lists element wise.
This was the problem description. Lets move on to the  annotated program. The program must do what the problem description says for it to be correct.

Annotated Program:
```
#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers of the same length.**
def func_1(list1, list2):
    if (len(list1) != len(list2)) :
        raise ValueError('Both lists must be of the same length')
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *list1 and list2 are lists of numbers of the same length. If the length of list1 is not equal to the length of list2, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. Otherwise, there are no changes to the lists.
    return [(x / y) for x, y in zip(list1, list2)]
    #The program returns a list of the result of dividing each element in list1 by the corresponding element in list2
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers of the same length. It then divides each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2` and returns a new list containing the results. If the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are not equal, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. The function does not handle potential division by zero errors, so this could be a missing edge case to consider.
```
The program is correct only if it meets the problem description! The problem description is defined before the program.  Return Correctness: **True** if the program follows the problem description, otherwise return Correctness: **False** if the program does not do what the problem description asks for for every potential case.
If the program is correct explain why it always does what the problem description say. If it is incorrect explain why it does not do what the problem description says or a case where it doesnot follow the problem description.
