Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input. It first checks if the lengths of both lists are equal. If they are not equal, it raises a `ValueError` as specified in the problem description. If the lengths are equal, it then performs element-wise division of the elements in `list1` by the corresponding elements in `list2` using list comprehension and `zip` function. Finally, it returns a new list containing the results of the division.

The program meets the requirements of the problem description as it correctly divides two lists element-wise and raises an error if the lists are not of the same length. It handles the specific case outlined in the problem description and returns the expected output.
