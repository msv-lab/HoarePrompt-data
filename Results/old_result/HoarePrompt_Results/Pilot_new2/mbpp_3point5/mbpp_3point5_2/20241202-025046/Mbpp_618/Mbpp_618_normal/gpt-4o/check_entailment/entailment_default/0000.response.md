Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the function `func_1` as described in the problem description. It accepts two lists of integers with the same length, divides each corresponding pair of elements from `list1` by `list2`, and returns a new list containing the results of these divisions. The code uses list comprehension and the `zip` function to achieve this element-wise division. The provided test cases also validate that the code works as expected for different input scenarios. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that the code does not handle correctly.
