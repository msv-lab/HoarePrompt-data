#State of the program right berfore the function call: list1 and list2 are lists of integers with the same length.**
def func_1(list1, list2):
    return [(a / b) for a, b in zip(list1, list2)]
    #The program returns a new list where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from list1 by list2. Both list1 and list2 are lists of integers with the same length.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two lists of integers with the same length, divides each corresponding pair of elements from list1 by list2, and returns a new list containing the results of these divisions. Both list1 and list2 must have the same length to perform the division operation accurately.
