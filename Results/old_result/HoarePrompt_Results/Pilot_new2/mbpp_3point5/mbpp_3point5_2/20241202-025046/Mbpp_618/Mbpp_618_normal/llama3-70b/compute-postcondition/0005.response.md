Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers of the same length. It then divides each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2` and returns a new list containing the results. If the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are not equal, a ValueError is raised with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. The function does not handle potential division by zero errors, so this could be a missing edge case to consider.**
