#State of the program right berfore the function call: binary_str is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and num_rotations is a non-negative integer.**
def func_1(binary_str, num_rotations):
    count = 0
    for _ in range(num_rotations):
        binary_str = binary_str[-1] + binary_str[:-1]

    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, `binary_str` is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's. `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. `count` is the number of times the integer value of the rotated `binary_str` is odd. `integer_value` is the integer value of the final rotated `binary_str` in base 2.
    return count
    #The program returns the number of times the integer value of the rotated `binary_str` is odd.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str`, which is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and `num_rotations`, a non-negative integer. It rotates the `binary_str` based on `num_rotations`, calculates the integer value of the rotated string, and counts the number of times the integer value is odd. The function then returns the count of odd integer values.
