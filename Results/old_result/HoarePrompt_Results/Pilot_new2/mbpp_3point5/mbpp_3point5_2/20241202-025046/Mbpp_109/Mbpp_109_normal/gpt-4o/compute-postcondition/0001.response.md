According to the code, the loop will execute if num_rotations is at least 1. Since binary_str is not directly involved in the loop condition, it does not need to be adjusted. At the start of the loop, count is 0, so it must be adjusted to 1 for the loop to execute.

State: **`binary_str` is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 1**
