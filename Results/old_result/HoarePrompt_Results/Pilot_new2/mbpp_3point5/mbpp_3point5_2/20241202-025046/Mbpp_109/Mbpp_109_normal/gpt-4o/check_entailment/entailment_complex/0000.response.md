Correctness: **True**

The program implements the function `func_1` as described in the problem description. It takes in a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`, rotates the string `num_rotations` times, calculates the integer value of the rotated string, and counts the number of times the integer value is odd. The program then returns the count of odd integer values.

The program correctly counts the number of times the integer value of the rotated `binary_str` is odd, so it meets the requirements of the problem description.
