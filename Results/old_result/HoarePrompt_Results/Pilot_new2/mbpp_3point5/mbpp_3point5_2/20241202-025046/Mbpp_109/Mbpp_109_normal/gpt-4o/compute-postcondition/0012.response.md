According to the code, the loop can execute `num_rotations` times. At the end of the last iteration, `binary_str` is rotated, `num_rotations` is decremented by 1, `count` may be updated based on the condition of the new `integer_value` being odd or even. If the new `integer_value` after rotation is odd, `count` is updated to 2; otherwise, it remains 3.

State: **`binary_str` is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, `num_rotations` is one less than the previous value, `count` is either 2 or 3 based on the condition of the new `integer_value` after rotation, `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated `binary_str` in base 2**.
