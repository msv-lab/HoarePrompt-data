Correctness: **True**

The given program implements the function `func_1` as described in the problem description. It takes a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, repeats the string `s` enough times to make its length greater than or equal to `n`, then calculates the total number of occurrences of '1' in the string `s` modulo 2 and returns this count. The program correctly handles all possible cases and follows the problem description accurately.

The program ensures that the binary string `s` is repeated enough times to cover the length required for `n`. It then correctly calculates the occurrences of '1' in the rotated string modulo 2. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of the program's behavior.
