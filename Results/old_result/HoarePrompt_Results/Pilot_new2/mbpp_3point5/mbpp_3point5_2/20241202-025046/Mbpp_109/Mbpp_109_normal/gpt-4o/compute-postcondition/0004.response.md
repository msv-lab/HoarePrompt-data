Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's. `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. `count` is 1. `binary_str` is the result of rotating the original `binary_str` to the right by 1 position. `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str` in base 2. The current value of `integer_value` is odd (integer_value % 2 == 1)***
