Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The function takes a binary string `s` and an integer `n` as input. It then rotates the binary string `s` `n` times and counts the number of occurrences of '1' in each rotation. If the count of '1' in a rotation is odd, it increments the `count` variable. Finally, it returns the total count of rotations where the count of '1' is odd.

The program correctly handles the problem description by rotating the binary string `s` the given number of times and correctly counting the number of '1's in each rotation. It then checks if this count is odd and increments the `count` variable accordingly. Since the logic in the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases, the correctness is True.
