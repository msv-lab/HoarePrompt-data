Correctness: False

The program provided is incorrect as it does not handle the case where the list is not sorted in ascending order. For example, the assertion `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False` should return False since the list `[1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]` is not sorted in ascending order.
