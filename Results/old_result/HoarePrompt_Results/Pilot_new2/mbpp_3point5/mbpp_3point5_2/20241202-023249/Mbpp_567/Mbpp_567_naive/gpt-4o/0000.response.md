Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly determine whether the specified list is sorted or not. It only checks if each element is less than or equal to the next element, which is not sufficient to ensure the list is sorted in ascending order. 

For example, consider the list [1, 3, 2]. The program would return True for this list, but it is not sorted as 3 comes before 2. Hence, the program is incorrect in this case.
