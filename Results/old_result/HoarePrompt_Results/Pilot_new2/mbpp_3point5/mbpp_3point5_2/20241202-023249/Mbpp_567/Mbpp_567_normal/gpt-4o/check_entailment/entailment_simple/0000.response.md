Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program defines a function that takes a list as input and checks whether the elements in the list are in non-decreasing order. It does this by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. If at any point an element is greater than the next one, the function returns False. If the loop completes without finding such a case, it returns True.

This program correctly follows the problem description because it effectively checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by verifying if all elements are in non-decreasing order. The logic used in the program aligns with the requirements of the problem description.
