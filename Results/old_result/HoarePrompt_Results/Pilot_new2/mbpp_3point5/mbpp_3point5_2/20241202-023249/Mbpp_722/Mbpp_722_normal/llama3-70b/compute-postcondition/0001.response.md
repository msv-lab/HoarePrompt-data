The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. 
`student_data` is a dictionary where keys are student names and values are tuples of float (student_height, student_weight). 
`min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively. 
After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary containing student names as keys and tuples of their height and weight as values, for students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to filter out students from the `student_data` dictionary based on their height and weight, returning a new dictionary with only the students meeting the specified height and weight criteria. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary with student data, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It returns a filtered dictionary containing student names and their corresponding height and weight, for students whose height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight.**
