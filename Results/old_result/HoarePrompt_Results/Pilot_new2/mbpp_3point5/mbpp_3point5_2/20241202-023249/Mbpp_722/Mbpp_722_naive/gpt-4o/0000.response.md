Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out students whose height and weight are both above the minimum values given. The program iterates through the student dictionary, checks if the height and weight of each student are greater than or equal to the minimum height and weight, and includes only those students in the final filtered dictionary. The provided test cases cover various scenarios where the function is expected to return the correct output, and based on those test cases, the function behaves as described in the problem description.
