Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. The parameter `student_dict` is a dictionary where keys are strings representing student names and values are tuples of two floats (student_height, student_weight). The function filters the student information based on the minimum height and weight provided, returning a dictionary with only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`.**
