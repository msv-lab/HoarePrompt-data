According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `tup`. If `tup` has more items, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` has at least 1 item and all items in `tup` are not None. So for the loop to execute one more time, `tup` must have more than 1 item.
State: **`tup` is a tuple that must have at least 2 items. All items in `tup` are not None**
