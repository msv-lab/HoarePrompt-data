Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be following the problem description correctly. The function `func_1` checks if the string `s` is empty and returns True if it is. Then it compares all characters in the string to the first character, returning True if they are all the same and False if any character is different. The code seems to cover all potential cases mentioned in the problem description. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the code is correct.
