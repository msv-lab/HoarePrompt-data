Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input. It then uses the `set` function to remove duplicate characters from the string `s` and checks if the length of the resulting set is equal to 1. If the length is 1, it means all characters in the string `s` are the same, so it returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

This implementation correctly checks whether all characters in the input string are the same, as specified in the problem description. The use of sets allows for a concise way to check for duplicates, and the comparison of the length of the set with 1 ensures that all characters are the same.
