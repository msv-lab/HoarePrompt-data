According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If there are more characters remaining in the string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string with characters remaining, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the next character after `first_char` in `s`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be more characters remaining in the string `s`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string with characters remaining, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the next character after `first_char` in `s**`.
