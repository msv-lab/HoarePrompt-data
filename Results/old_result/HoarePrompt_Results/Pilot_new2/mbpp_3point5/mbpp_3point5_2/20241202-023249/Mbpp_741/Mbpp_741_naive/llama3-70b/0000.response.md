Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` checks if all characters in the input string `s` are the same by converting the string to a set (which removes duplicates) and checking if the length of the set is equal to 1. This logic correctly captures the essence of the problem description which is to check if all characters are the same or not. It covers all potential cases where if the input string contains different characters, the set will have a length greater than 1 and the function will return False. Therefore, the program is correct.
