Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether all characters in the input string `s` are the same or not. It first checks if the string is empty, and if so, it returns True. Then, it initializes `first_char` to the first character of the string `s` and iterates through each character in `s`. If any character is different from `first_char`, it immediately returns False. Otherwise, if all characters are the same, it returns True at the end. This logic ensures that the program accurately determines whether all characters are the same in the input string.
