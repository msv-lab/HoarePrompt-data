Postcondition: ***nums is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, count is the total number of times ((nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0) is true for all valid pairs of i and j, where i is len(nums) + 1, i is the index after the last element in nums. Additionally, after entering the if condition (((nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0)), the current values of nums[i] and nums[j] satisfy the condition where the result of the XOR operation between nums[i] and nums[j] is an even number.***
