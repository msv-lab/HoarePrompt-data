According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `nums` has at least 1 integer. Since the loop iterates over the length of `nums`, it will execute as long as the list is not empty. At the start, `count` is 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the list must have at least 1 integer present, `i` is 0, and the loop body will be executed.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 1 integer, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
