The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. It iterates through all valid pairs of elements in the list and counts the total number of pairs where the bitwise XOR operation between the pair results in an even number. The function then returns this count as the output. The function accurately calculates the total number of valid pairs where the condition ((nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0) is true.
