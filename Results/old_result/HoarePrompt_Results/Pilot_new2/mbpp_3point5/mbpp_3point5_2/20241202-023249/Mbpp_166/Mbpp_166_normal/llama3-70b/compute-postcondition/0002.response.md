According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and the length of `nums`. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `i` is 0, so we need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `nums` must have at least 2 integers, `count` remains 0, and `i` is now 0 as mentioned in the initial state.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers that must have at least 2 integers, `count` is 0, `i` is 0**
