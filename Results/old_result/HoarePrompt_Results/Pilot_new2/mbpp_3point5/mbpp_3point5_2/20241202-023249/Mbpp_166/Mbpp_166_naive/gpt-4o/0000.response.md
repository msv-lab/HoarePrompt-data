Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect. 

Explanation: The program does not correctly count the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number. The logic used in the program is flawed. The program is simply counting the number of even and odd elements in the list and then calculating pairs based on those counts without actually checking if the XOR of the pairs is even. 

For example:
- For input [5, 4, 7, 2, 1], the expected output should be 4, but the program returns 6.
- For input [7, 2, 8, 1, 0, 5, 11], the expected output should be 9, but the program returns 15. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
