According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `count` is 1, `i` is 0, and the current values of `i` and `j` are such that ((nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0). For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **nums is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, count is 1, i is 0, j is such that j = j + 1 and ((nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0)**
