Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula provided in the problem description. The formula used in the program (math.pi * radius ** 2 * height) is consistent with the formula for calculating the volume of a cylinder (Ï€r^2h). Thus, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
