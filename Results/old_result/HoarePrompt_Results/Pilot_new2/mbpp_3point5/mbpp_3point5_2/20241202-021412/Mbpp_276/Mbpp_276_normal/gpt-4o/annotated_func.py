#State of the program right berfore the function call: radius and height are non-negative numbers.**
def func_1(radius, height):
    volume = math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    return volume
    #The program returns the volume calculated using the formula math.pi * radius^2 * height, where radius and height are non-negative numbers
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two non-negative numbers, calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula math.pi * radius^2 * height, and returns the calculated volume. It is missing the import statement for the math module.
