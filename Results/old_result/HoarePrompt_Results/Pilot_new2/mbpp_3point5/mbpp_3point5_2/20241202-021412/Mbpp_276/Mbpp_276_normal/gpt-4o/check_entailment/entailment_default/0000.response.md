Correctness: **False**

The code does not include the import statement for the math module as mentioned in the problem description. This means that the code will throw an error when trying to use `math.pi` in the `func_1` function. 

Additionally, the code seems to be correctly calculating the volume of a cylinder using the formula `math.pi * radius^2 * height`. The output hints also agree with the code in terms of what the function `func_1` is supposed to do.
