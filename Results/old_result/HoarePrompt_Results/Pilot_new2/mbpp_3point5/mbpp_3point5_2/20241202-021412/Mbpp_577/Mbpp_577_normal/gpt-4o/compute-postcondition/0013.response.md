Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial. **

This summary covers the cases where `n` is less than 5 and the factorial is computed, returning the last digit. It also includes the scenario where `n` is 5 or greater, resulting in the function returning 0.
