Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly returns the last digit in the factorial of a given number. It covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description:
- If the input number is less than 2, it returns the input number itself.
- If the input number is 2 or 3, it returns the input number itself.
- If the input number is 4, it returns 4 (as the factorial of 4 ends in 4).
- For any other input number, it returns 0 (as the factorial of any number greater than 4 always ends in 0).

Therefore, the program satisfies the requirements mentioned in the problem description and is correct.
