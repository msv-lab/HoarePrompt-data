The value of `factorial` is multiplied by the value of `i`. The value of `i` is increased by 1. As `n` is a non-negative integer and less than 6, after the code execution, `factorial` is updated to its current value multiplied by `i+1`, and `i` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer and less than 6, `factorial` is updated to its current value multiplied by `i+1`, `i` is increased by 1**.
