Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly find the last digit of the factorial of a given number for all potential cases. The program only returns 0 for any input greater than 4, which is incorrect. For example, the factorial of 5 is 120, and the last digit of 120 is 0 which is incorrect according to the program's implementation. Hence, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
