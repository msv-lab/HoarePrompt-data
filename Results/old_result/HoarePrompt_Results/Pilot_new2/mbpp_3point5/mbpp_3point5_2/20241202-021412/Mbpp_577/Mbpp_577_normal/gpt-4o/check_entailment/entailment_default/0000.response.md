Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of the factorial. The code includes assertions with example test cases, and upon manual testing, the function produces the expected output for the given inputs. Additionally, the output hints also align with the logic of the code, confirming that the implementation is correct. Overall, the code satisfies the problem description and handles all potential cases as specified.
