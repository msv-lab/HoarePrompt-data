Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not adhere to the problem description. The function `func_1` returns different values based on specific conditions for `n` values less than or equal to 4, but the problem description specifies that the function should find the last digit in the factorial of a given number. The function does not calculate the factorial of the given number and find its last digit, so it does not meet the requirements of the problem description. 

Additionally, the output hints do not support the functionality described in the code. The code does not calculate the factorial of the input number, but rather returns fixed values based on specific conditions, which does not align with the output hints or the problem description. 

Therefore, the code is incorrect.
