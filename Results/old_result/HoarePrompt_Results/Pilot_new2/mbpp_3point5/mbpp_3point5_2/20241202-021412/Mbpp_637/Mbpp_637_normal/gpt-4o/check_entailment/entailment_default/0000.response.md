Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes two arguments `cost_price` and `selling_price`. It then checks if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price` and returns True if they are equal, otherwise it returns False. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which states that the function should return True if the cost price is equal to the selling price, and False otherwise. Additionally, the provided test cases also confirm that the code is working correctly for all potential cases mentioned in the problem description. Hence, the code is correct.
