Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The annotated program consists of a function `func_1` that checks whether the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`. This directly aligns with the problem description which asks for a function to check if there is no profit and no loss, which would mean that the cost price is equal to the selling price. Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the requirements of the problem description.
