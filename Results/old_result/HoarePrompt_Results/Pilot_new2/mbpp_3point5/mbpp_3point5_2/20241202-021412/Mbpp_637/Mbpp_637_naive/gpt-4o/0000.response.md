Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price. If they are equal, it means there is no profit or loss, hence returning `True`. If they are not equal, it means there is either profit or loss, hence returning `False`. The provided test cases cover both scenarios, where the code returns the expected output for each case. Therefore, the program is correct.
