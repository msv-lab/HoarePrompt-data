Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl` as input, then converts the tuple to a list using the `list()` function and concatenates it to the original list `lst` using the `+` operator. The function then returns the concatenated list. 

In all the provided test cases, the function correctly adds the elements of the tuple to the given list and returns the expected output. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the function fails to follow the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
