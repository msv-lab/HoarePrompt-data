The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `tup`, which is a tuple. The function returns a new list that is the concatenation of the elements in the list `lst` and the elements in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and return a new list that contains the elements of both `lst` and `tup` concatenated together.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the elements of `lst` and `tup`.**
