The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `tpl`, which is a tuple. After executing the function body, the program returns a new list that consists of the elements of list `lst` followed by the elements of tuple `tpl`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, then return a new list containing the elements of `lst` followed by the elements of `tpl`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list lst and a tuple tpl, returns a new list that consists of the elements of lst followed by the elements of tpl.**
