Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input and returns a new list by adding the elements of the tuple to the list. The program simply converts the tuple to a list using the `list()` function and concatenates it with the given list. This logic is correct as it satisfies the problem description of adding the given tuple to the given list. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
