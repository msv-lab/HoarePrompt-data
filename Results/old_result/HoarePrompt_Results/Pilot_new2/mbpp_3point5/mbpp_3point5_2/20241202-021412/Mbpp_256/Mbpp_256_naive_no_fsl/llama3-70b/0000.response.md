Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program defines a function that correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number `n`. The `is_prime` function correctly determines if a number is prime or not, and the main function iterates through numbers from 2 to `n-1` (exclusive) and counts the prime numbers. The logic is implemented properly and there are no edge cases where the program fails to count the prime numbers as required by the problem description. Hence, the program is correct.
