According to the code, the loop can execute based on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2 such that `is_prime[i]` is True, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1] are False, `j` is in the range `[i * i, n)`, `is_prime[j]` is False, `j` is updated to the next value where `is_prime[j]` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False. To execute the loop one more time, we need to find the next `j` value where `is_prime[j]` is False.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2 such that `is_prime[i]` is True, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1] are False, `j` is updated to the next value where `is_prime[j]` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False**.
