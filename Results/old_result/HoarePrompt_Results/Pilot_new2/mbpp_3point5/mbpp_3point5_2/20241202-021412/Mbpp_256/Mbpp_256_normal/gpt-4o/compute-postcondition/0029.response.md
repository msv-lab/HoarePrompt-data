According to the code, the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 5. For the next iteration, `i` will be increased by 1, so `i` will be 6. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be greater than 6.

State: **`n` is at least 6, `i` is 6, `is_prime[4]` is False, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are False, `is_prime[3]` is True, multiples of 3 in the range `[3 * 3, n)` are set to False, all other `is_prime[j]` where `j` is not a multiple of 3 in the range `[3, n)` are False**
