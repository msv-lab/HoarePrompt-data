Output State: **After the loop finishes executing, all elements of `is_prime` will be updated based on the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then `is_prime[j]` where j is a multiple of i and in the range `[i * i, n)` will be set to False. All other `is_prime[j]` where j is not a multiple of i in the range `[i, n)` will remain True.**
