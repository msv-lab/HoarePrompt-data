The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a non-negative integer. The function has multiple cases for returning a value based on the input `num`:

Case 1: If `num` is a non-negative integer less than 2, the function returns False.
Case 2: If `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2 and divisible by 2 without a remainder, the function returns False.
Case 3: This case will return False.
Case 4: This case will return False.
Case 5: If `num` satisfies neither Case 1 nor Case 2, the function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and determine if it is a prime number based on the given conditions.
