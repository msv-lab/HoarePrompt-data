Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, the function applies the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to generate a list of prime numbers up to `n`, and then returns the sum of all prime numbers in the list. The code accurately implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine prime numbers and calculates the sum correctly. Additionally, the examples provided in the code assert statements also validate that the code is functioning as expected for those cases.
