According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is in the range `[i * i, n)` and `is_prime[j]` is False. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 2 such that `is_prime[i]` is True, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1] are False, `j` is in the range `[i * i, n)`, `is_prime[j]` is False. 

To execute one more time, `j` must be incremented by `i`, which means `j` should be updated to be greater than the current `j` value but still less than `n` and `is_prime[j]` should be False after the update.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 2 such that `is_prime[i]` is True, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1] are False, `j` is in the range `[i * i, n)`, `is_prime[j]` is False, `j` is updated to the next value where `is_prime[j]` is False.**
