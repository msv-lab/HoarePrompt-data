According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `is_prime[3]` is False, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` remain False, all `is_prime[j]` multiples of 3 in the range `[3 * 3, n)` are False, `j` is the next multiple of 3 after the previous iteration's `j`, and `is_prime[j]` is now False. 
To execute the loop one more time, the next multiple of 3 after the previous iteration's `j` needs to be calculated. This next multiple of 3 can be obtained by adding `i` (which is 3) to the previous `j`. Based on the given information, the next multiple of 3 after the previous iteration's `j` should be 6. Thus, `j` should be updated to 6.
State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `is_prime[3]` is False, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` remain False, all `is_prime[j]` multiples of 3 in the range `[3 * 3, n)` are False, `j` is 6, `is_prime[6]` is now False**.
