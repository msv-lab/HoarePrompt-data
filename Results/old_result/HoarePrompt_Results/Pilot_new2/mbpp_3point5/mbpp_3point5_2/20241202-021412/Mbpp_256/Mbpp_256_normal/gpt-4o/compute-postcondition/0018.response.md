According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range `[i * i, n)` and increments by `i` each time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `is_prime[3]` is False, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` remain False, and all `is_prime[j]` multiples of 3 in the range `[3 * 3, n)` are False. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next multiple of 3 after the previous iteration's `j`. This means that the next multiple of 3 after `i * i` needs to be calculated and assigned to `j`. Additionally, `is_prime[j]` needs to be updated to False for this new `j`.

State: **`n` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `is_prime[3]` is False, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` remain False, all `is_prime[j]` multiples of 3 in the range `[3 * 3, n)` are False, `j` is the next multiple of 3 after the previous iteration's `j` and `is_prime[j]` is False**
