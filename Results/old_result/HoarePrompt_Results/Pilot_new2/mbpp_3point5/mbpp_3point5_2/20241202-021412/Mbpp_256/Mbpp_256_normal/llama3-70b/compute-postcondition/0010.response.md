According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `num`. If `num` is not divisible by 3, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must still be a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2 but not divisible by 3.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2 and not divisible by 3**
