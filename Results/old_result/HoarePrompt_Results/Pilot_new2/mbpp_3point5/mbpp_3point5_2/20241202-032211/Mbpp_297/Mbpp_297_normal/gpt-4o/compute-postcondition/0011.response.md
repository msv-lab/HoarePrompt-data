According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least one more element to iterate over, the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `flat_list` is a list. If the next `item` is a list, `flat_list` will contain elements returned by `func_1(item)` for the second element in `nested_list` and elements previously in `flat_list`. If the next `item` is not a list, `flat_list` will contain `item` itself.

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be at least one more element in `nested_list` to iterate over.

State: **`flat_list` is a list. If `item` is a list, `flat_list` will contain elements returned by `func_1(item)` for the second element in `nested_list` and elements previously in `flat_list`. If `item` is not a list, `flat_list` will contain `item` itself.** There must be at least one more element in `nested_list` to iterate over.
