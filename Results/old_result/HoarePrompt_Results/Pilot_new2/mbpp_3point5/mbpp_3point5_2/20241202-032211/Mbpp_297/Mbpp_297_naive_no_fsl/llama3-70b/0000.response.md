Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly flattens a given nested list structure by recursively iterating through each element of the list. The program extends the flat_list with the flattened result of any nested lists encountered. This logic ensures that the program accurately flattens all levels of nesting within the input list. Additionally, by appending non-list elements directly to the flat_list, the program maintains the order of elements in the original nested list structure. Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and handles all potential cases of nested lists.
