Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the function to flatten a given nested list structure. It recursively goes through each element in the nested list, if the element is a list, it calls the function recursively to flatten that sublist. Otherwise, it appends the element to the `flat_list`. This process ensures that all nested lists are flattened into a single list as required by the problem description. The program handles nested lists of any depth and correctly returns a flattened list. Hence, the program meets the requirements of the problem description.
