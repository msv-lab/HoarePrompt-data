Correctness: **True**

In the given program, the function `func_1` recursively flattens a nested list structure by checking each item in the input list. If the item is a list, it calls itself recursively to flatten that sublist. If the item is not a list, it appends the item to the `flat_list`. This process continues until all nested lists are flattened.

The program has been tested with multiple nested list inputs and in all cases, it correctly flattens the nested list structure and returns the expected output. Therefore, based on the provided examples and the logic of the program, it can be concluded that the program is correct for all potential cases.
