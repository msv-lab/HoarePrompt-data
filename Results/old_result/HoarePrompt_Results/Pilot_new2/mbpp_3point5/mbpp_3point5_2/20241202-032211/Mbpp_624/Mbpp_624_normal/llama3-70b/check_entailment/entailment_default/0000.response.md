Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of the string using the `upper()` method. This aligns perfectly with the problem description, which states that the function should convert a given string to uppercase. There are no edge cases or missing functionalities in the code, and the output hints also confirm that the function is correctly implemented. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
