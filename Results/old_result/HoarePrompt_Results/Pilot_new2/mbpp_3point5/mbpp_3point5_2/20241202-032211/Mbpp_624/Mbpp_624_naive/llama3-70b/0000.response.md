Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of the string using the `upper()` method in Python. This implementation directly aligns with the problem description of converting a given string to uppercase. 

Since the `upper()` method in Python reliably converts a string to uppercase for all potential cases, we can confidently say that the program is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
