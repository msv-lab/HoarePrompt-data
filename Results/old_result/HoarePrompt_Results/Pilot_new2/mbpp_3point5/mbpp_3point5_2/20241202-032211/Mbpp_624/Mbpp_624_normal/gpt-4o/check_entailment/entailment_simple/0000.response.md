Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of the input string using the `upper()` method. This aligns with the problem description, which asks for a function to convert a given string to uppercase. The program works correctly for all possible cases as the `upper()` method in Python ensures that all characters in the string are converted to uppercase.
