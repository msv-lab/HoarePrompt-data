Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple `tup` as input. It iterates through the elements of the tuple and returns the index of the first tuple found in the tuple. If no tuple is found, it returns the length of the tuple. This matches the problem description accurately.

The program correctly handles the case where there are multiple tuples in the input tuple. By using `tup.index(elem)`, it ensures that the index of the first tuple encountered is returned. Additionally, by returning `len(tup)` if no tuples are found, it covers the scenario where there are no tuples in the input tuple.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
