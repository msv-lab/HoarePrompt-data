Correctness: **False**

In the given program, the function `func_1` is supposed to return the difference between two lists by finding the elements that are unique to each list. However, the program does not work correctly for all potential cases. 

For example, if we consider the input lists `[1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1]`, the expected output based on the problem description should be `[2, 3, 6, 7]`. However, the program returns `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` which includes elements that are not in either of the input lists. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem description.
