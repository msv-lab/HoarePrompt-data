Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. While the code correctly finds the symmetric difference between the two input lists and converts it into a list, the sorting of the result list is based on the index of elements in the concatenated list of list1 and list2. This sorting approach may not always correctly order the elements as expected. For example, in the case where the elements in the result list have the same index in both input lists, the sorting based on the concatenated list index might not be accurate. This indicates a potential flaw in the implementation that deviates from the problem description.
