Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function correctly calculates the difference between two lists by first converting them to sets to remove duplicates, then using the symmetric difference operator (^) to find elements that are present in only one of the lists. The result is then sorted before being returned. This logic covers all potential cases and the function works as expected.
