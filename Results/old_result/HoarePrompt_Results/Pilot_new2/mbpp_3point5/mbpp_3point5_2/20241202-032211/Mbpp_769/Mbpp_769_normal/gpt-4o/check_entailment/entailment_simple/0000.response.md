Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in two lists `list1` and `list2`. It first converts both lists into sets `set1` and `set2` to get the unique elements in each list. Then, it calculates the symmetric difference between the two sets to get the elements that are unique to either set. The program then converts the resulting set back into a list `result_list` and sorts it based on the index of each element in the concatenated list of `list1` and `list2`.

The program correctly implements the problem description by getting the difference between two lists and returning a sorted list of unique elements. It follows the requirements of the problem description and hence the correctness is True.
