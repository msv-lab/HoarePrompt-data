The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`. `list1` and `list2` are lists. After executing the function body, the program returns a sorted list of unique elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists `list1` and `list2`, and return a sorted list of unique elements that are present in either list1 or list2, but not in both. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists list1 and list2, returns a sorted list of unique elements present in either list1 or list2, but not in both.**
