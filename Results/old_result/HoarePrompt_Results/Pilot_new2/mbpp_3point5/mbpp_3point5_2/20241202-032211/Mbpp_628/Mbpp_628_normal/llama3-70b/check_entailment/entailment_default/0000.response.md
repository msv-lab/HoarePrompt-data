Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and replaces all spaces in the string with '%20' using the `replace` method. The problem description specifies that the function should accept a string parameter `s` and return a new string where all spaces are replaced by '%20', which is exactly what the code does. There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the code does not handle, and the output hints also confirm that the code aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
