Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum number of bourles the user can hold after the evening based on the given problem description. It correctly determines the minimum buy price and the maximum sell price, then calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought and the remaining bourles after buying those shares. Finally, it calculates the total bourles after selling the maximum number of shares at the maximum sell price.

The program handles the case where the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, indicating that there is no profit to be made, and simply prints the initial number of bourles the user has.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly determines the maximum number of bourles the user can hold after the evening.
