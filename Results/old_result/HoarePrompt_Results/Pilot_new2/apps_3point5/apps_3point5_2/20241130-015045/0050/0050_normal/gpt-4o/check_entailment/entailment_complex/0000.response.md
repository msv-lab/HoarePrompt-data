Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads the input values for the number of shares, prices of shares, and initial investment. It then calculates the maximum profit that can be obtained from buying and selling the shares based on the given parameters. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, it prints the initial investment. Otherwise, it calculates the total profit by determining the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the initial investment, the remaining amount after buying shares, and the total profit from selling the bought shares. The function finally prints the total profit achieved.

The program covers all cases as described in the problem description and implements the required logic correctly.
