Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of ways to buy shares, the number of ways to sell shares, and the initial amount of bourles.
2. The program then reads the prices for buying and selling shares and sorts them in ascending order for buying and descending order for selling.
3. It iterates through the buying opportunities and buys as many shares as possible with the available bourles, updating the remaining amount of bourles.
4. It then iterates through the selling opportunities and sells all the shares bought earlier, updating the final amount of bourles.
5. The output is the correct maximum number of bourles that can be held after the evening.
6. The program handles all potential cases where buying and selling shares can maximize the final amount of bourles.
