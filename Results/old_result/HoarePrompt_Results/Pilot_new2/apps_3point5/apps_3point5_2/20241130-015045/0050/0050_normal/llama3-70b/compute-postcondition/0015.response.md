Output State: **n, m, r are all integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, s_i and b_i are integers indicating the price of shares such that 1 <= s_i, b_i <= 1000, s is a list containing integers obtained from splitting the input and sorted in ascending order, b is a list containing integers obtained from splitting the input and sorted in descending order, i is 1, shares is assigned the value of the integer division of r by s[i]. If r is greater than or equal to s[i], the current value of r is greater than or equal to s[i]. If r is less than s[i], we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. `shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`.**
