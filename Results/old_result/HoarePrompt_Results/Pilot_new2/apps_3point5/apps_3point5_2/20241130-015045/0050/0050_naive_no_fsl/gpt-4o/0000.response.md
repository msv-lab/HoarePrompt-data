Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly determines the minimum buy price and maximum sell price. It then calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the available bourles and the remaining bourles after buying those shares. Finally, it calculates the total bourles after selling all the shares bought at the maximum sell price. The logic seems to be correct and covers all the cases as per the problem description.
