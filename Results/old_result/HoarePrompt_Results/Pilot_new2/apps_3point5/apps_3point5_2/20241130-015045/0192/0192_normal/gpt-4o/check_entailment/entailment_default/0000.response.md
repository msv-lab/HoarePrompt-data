Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers `x` and `y` from input, then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length `y` if he starts with the equilateral triangle of side length `x`. The formula used in the code `((x - y) // 2) + ((x - y) % 2)` correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required to transform the triangle as per the problem description. The code handles all potential cases and aligns with the problem description. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly solved by the code, confirming its correctness.
