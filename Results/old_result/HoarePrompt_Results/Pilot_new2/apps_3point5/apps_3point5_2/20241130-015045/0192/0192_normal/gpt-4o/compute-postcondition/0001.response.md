Example Answer:
The code calculates and prints the value of ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2). It is important to note that x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000, and they are assigned the integers obtained from splitting the input. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000**
