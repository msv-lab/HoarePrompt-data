Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program takes the input values for x and y, calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y using the formula ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2), and then prints the result. The formula correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required by considering the difference between x and y, ensuring that the triangle sides remain integers, and handling both even and odd differences appropriately. The program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
