Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads two integers x and y from the input and prints the absolute difference between x and y. The problem description states that in a single second, Memory can modify the length of a single side of the current triangle such that it remains a non-degenerate triangle. The code correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x by simply taking the absolute difference between x and y. The code covers all potential cases as it adheres to the problem description for all possible input values within the given constraints.
