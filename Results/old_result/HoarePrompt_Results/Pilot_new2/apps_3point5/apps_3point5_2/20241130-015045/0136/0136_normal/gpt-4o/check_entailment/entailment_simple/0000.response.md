Correctness: **True**

The program correctly reads two very large integers a and b from the input, removes any leading zeros, and compares the two numbers. It then prints "<" if a < b, ">" if a > b, and "=" if a = b, as specified in the problem description. The program logic handles all possible cases including when the lengths of a and b are equal, a is less than b, and a is greater than b. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
