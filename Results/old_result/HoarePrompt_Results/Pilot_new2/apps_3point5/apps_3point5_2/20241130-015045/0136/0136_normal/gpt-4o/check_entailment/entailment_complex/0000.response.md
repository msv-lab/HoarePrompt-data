Correctness: **True**

The program takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input and removes any leading zeros if present. It then compares the lengths of `a` and `b` and prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if they are equal. The program correctly handles cases where `a` or `b` evaluate to '0' and scenarios where the lengths of `a` and `b` are different. The annotations in the code also explain the state of the program at different points, making it clear how the comparison is done. Overall, the program follows the problem description and behaves as expected for all cases.
