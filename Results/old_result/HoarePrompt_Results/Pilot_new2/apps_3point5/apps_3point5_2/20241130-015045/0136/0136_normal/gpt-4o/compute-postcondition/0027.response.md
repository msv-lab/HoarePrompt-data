Functionality: **The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads input values for two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, removing leading zeros if present. Then, it compares the lengths of `a` and `b`, printing '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>', if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if they are equal. The functionality of the function is to compare and print the relationship between two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, handling cases where `a` or `b` evaluates to '0' and scenarios where the lengths of `a` and `b` are different.**
