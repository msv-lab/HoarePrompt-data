According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18
- `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18
- `total_days` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`
- `numerator` is equal to 1
- `denominator` is equal to 1
State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is equal to 1, `denominator` is equal to 1**
