Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `total_days` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, `denominator` is equal to `(denominator * total_days) % MOD`, `i` is an integer such that 0 ≤ i < k + 1, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`**.
