The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. It iterates over the value of `b`, updating the values of `a` and `b` accordingly until `b` becomes 0. Finally, the function returns the final value of `a` after all iterations. The function essentially implements the Euclidean algorithm to find the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b`.
