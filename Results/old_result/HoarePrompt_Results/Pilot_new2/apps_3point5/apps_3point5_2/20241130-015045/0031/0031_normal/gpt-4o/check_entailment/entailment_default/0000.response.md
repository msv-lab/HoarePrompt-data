Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code seems to correctly implement the Birthday Paradox problem as described in the problem statement.
- The `func_1` function calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm, which is necessary for simplifying fractions.
- The `func_2` function correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days, where k people are interviewed.
- The code efficiently handles the calculation of probabilities and reduces the fractions to irreducible form.
- The program also correctly handles the cases specified in the problem description and provides the output in the required format.
