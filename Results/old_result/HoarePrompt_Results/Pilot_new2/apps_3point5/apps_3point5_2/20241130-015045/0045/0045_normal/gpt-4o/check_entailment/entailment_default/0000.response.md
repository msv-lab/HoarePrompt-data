Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input values for `n` and `k` and then calls the `func_1` function to generate a sequence of k positive numbers with a maximum greatest common divisor that sums up to `n`.
- The function first calculates the minimum sum that the sequence can have, which is `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`. If this calculated minimum sum is greater than `n`, then it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
- If the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`, the function then calculates the value of `d` as `n // min_sum`, which is the common divisor for all elements in the sequence.
- It then computes the remainder after dividing `n` by `min_sum` and generates a sequence list by incrementing `d` from `1` to `k` in steps of `1`. If there is a remainder, it distributes the remainder across the sequence.
- Finally, the function returns the generated sequence.
- The code then prints the resulting sequence if it is not -1.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case and correctly generates a sequence of k positive numbers with a maximum greatest common divisor that sums up to `n`.
