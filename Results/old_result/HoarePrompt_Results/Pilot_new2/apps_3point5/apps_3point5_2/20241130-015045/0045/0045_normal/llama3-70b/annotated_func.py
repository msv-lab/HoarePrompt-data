#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10.**
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `a` is equal to the greatest common divisor of the original values of `n` and `k`, and `b` is 0
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of `n` and `k`, which is stored in variable `a`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. It calculates the greatest common divisor of the original values of `n` and `k` using the Euclidean algorithm and returns that value. The function correctly handles the case where one of the input integers is 0 due to the nature of the algorithm, resulting in the function returning the non-zero input value as the greatest common divisor.
