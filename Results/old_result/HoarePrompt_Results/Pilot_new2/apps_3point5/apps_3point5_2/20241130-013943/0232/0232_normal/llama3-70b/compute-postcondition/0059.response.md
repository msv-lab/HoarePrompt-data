Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary with color as the key and the updated value where the count of `color` has been incremented by 1. `i`, `j`, `n`, and `color` remain the same as described in the initial state. The current values of `i`, `j`, `n`, and `color` remain unchanged. All the values in `window_counts` are sorted, and each value matches the corresponding value in the list `counts`.***
