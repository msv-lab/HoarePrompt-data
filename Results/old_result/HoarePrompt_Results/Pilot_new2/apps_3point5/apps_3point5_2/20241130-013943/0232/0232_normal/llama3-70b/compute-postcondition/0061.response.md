Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary with color as the key and the updated value where the count of `color` has been incremented by 1, `i`, `j`, `n`, and `color` remain the same as described in the initial state. The values in `window_counts` are still sorted and match the corresponding values in the list `counts`. `found` is True. The `break` statement is executed, so the program breaks out of the current loop or if statement.**
