The loop can execute if the colors list is not empty. Additionally, to execute the loop, color needs to take on each value in the colors list. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors list contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} and is not empty; counts list is populated with integers obtained from splitting the input; color_counts is an empty dictionary; color is the first color in the colors list**
