Postcondition: ***`found` remains True, `window_counts` contains counts of each color equal to their corresponding targets, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `n`, `n` is the total number of colors, `color` is now equal to the last color in the list `colors`. If `color` was not present in the `window_counts` dictionary, `window_counts[color]` is now equal to 2.***
