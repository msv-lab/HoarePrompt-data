Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if block with the condition 'found', the state of the program variables is as follows: `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` list contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} and is not empty, `counts` list is populated with integers obtained from splitting the input, `color_counts` dictionary contains the count of each color in colors, `found` remains True, `window_counts` dictionary includes the count of each color as a key with the corresponding value, and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement if all counts in `window_counts` after sorting match the corresponding targets in `counts`.***
