Postcondition: ***`found` remains True. `window_counts` contains counts of each color equal to their corresponding targets. `i` is incremented by 1. `j` is equal to `n-1`. `n` is the total number of colors. `color` is the last color in the list `colors`. `color` is the last color in the list `colors` corresponding to index `n-1`. `window_counts[color]` is now equal to 1 if the color was not present in the `window_counts` dictionary.***
