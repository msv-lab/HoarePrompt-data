Postcondition: ***At least one color count in `current_counts` is less than the desired count. Not all color counts in `current_counts` are equal to the desired counts in `desired_counts`. The count of the color at index `colors[left]` in `current_counts` has been incremented by 1. `left` has been incremented by 1. If all color counts in `current_counts` are equal to the desired counts, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes.***
