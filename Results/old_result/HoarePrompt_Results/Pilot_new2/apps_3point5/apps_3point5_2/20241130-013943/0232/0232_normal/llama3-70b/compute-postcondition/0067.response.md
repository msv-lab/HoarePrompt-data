Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary where the count of each color has been decremented by 1, except for the color 'color' which is now 1. `i`, `j+1`, `n`, and `found` remain unchanged. The values in `window_counts` are sorted and match the corresponding values in the list `counts`. The variable `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j] + 1`.**
