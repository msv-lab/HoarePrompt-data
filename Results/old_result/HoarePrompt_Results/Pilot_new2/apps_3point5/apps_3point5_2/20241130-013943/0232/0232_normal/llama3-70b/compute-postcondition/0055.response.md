Postcondition: ***window_counts dictionary is initialized as an empty dictionary, `i` is the starting value, `j` is equal to `i`, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, and `color` is equal to `colors[i]`. The current value of `i` and `j` is the starting value. If the color is not already in window_counts, then the color is not in window_counts.***
