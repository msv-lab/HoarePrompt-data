Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if else block, `window_counts` has been incremented by 1 for the color `color`, except for the color 'color' which is now 1 if color not in `window_counts`, `i` is increased by 1, `j+1` is increased by 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to `j+1`, `found` is True, and `color` is the color at index `j` in the list `colors`. Additionally, the condition that all `count` values in `window_counts` are equal to their respective `target` values has been checked using the `zip` function. If this condition is met, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
