Postcondition: ***window_counts is a dictionary and is initialized with the color as the key and the value 0. `i`, `j` are the starting value, `n` must be greater than or equal to `i`, and `color` is equal to `colors[i]`. If the color is not already in window_counts, then the color is now in window_counts with a value of 0.***
