Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases. It checks the relationship between the number of upvotes, downvotes, and unknown votes and prints the appropriate result according to the rules specified in the problem description. It covers all scenarios where the result can be determined with certainty and correctly identifies when the result is uncertain. The output hints also align with the code logic and confirm that the code functions as intended. Overall, the code meets the requirements of the problem description and provides the correct output for all possible cases.
