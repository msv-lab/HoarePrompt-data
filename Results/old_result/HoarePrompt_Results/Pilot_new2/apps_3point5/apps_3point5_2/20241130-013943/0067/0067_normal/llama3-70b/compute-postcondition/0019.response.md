Functionality: **The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, `z` from the input. It then checks the relationship between `x`, `y`, and `z` and prints a specific character based on the conditions. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, it prints '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints '-'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is 0, it prints '0'. If `x` is equal to `y` and `z` is not 0, it prints '?'. If none of the above conditions are met, it also prints '?'. The function does not explicitly return any values or accept parameters.**
