Postcondition: ***Output State: min_upvotes is equal to x. max_upvotes is equal to x + z. min_downvotes is equal to y. max_downvotes is equal to y + z. The condition (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) is false, meaning max_upvotes is greater than or equal to min_downvotes. The current state of the program variables after entering the if condition is that the statement (max_downvotes < min_upvotes) is true.***
