Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the smallest integer n that Vasya could pass to Kate based on the given input strings. It iterates through the string received by Kate, checks if each character is in the substring that Vasya remembers, and constructs the smallest possible integer n accordingly. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles the scenario where the substring may contain leading zeroes. Overall, the program is correct for all potential cases.
