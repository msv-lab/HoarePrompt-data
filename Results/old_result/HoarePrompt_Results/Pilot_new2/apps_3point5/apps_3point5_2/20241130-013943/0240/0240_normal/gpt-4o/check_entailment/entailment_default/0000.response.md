After reviewing the provided code and the problem description, as well as the output hints, I have come to the conclusion about the correctness of the program.

Function 1: The `func_1` function takes a string `s` and a substring `sub` as input and aims to find the smallest possible initial integer `n`. It calculates the difference in lengths between `s` and `sub`, updates the counts of characters in `s` using Counter objects, generates possible numbers from the remaining characters after subtracting the counts of `sub_counter` from `s_counter`, and returns the smallest number. The function seems to cover all cases as per the problem description, including handling the scenario where the input data is correct and the smallest number always exists. The output hints also confirm the functionality of the function. Therefore, 

Correctness: **True**

Function 2: The `is_valid_number` function checks if the substring `sub` is present in the number `num_str` and if the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`. However, the function uses `n_len` without defining it within the function, which could lead to unexpected behavior. Additionally, the function does not handle cases where `num_str` or `sub` are empty strings. This could potentially impact the correctness of the function as it might not be able to handle edge cases correctly. 

Correctness: **False**

Function 3: The `generate_possible_numbers` function generates all possible numbers by permuting the digits in `chars` and yields those numbers that contain the substring `sub`. The code seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem description. The output hints also support the function's approach of permuting the digits and checking for the presence of the substring `sub`. Therefore, 

Correctness: **True**

Overall, the program seems to correctly implement the functionality required to find the smallest possible initial integer `n` based on the information provided, except for the issue identified in Function 2.
