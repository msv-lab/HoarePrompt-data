#State of the program right berfore the function call: s and t are strings.**
def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` is a string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, `n` is a string containing the concatenation of all characters in `s` that are present in `t_set`
    n += t
    return int(n)
    #The program returns the integer value of the concatenation of all characters in string `s` that are present in the unique elements of string `t`, followed by string `t`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters `s` and `t`. It creates a new string `n` by concatenating all characters from `s` that are present in the unique elements of `t`, followed by the whole string `t`. Finally, it converts this resulting string into an integer and returns it.
