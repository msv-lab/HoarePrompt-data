Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes two inputs, the string received by Kate and the substring that Vasya remembers. It then iterates through the input string, only adding the characters that are present in the remembered substring to a new string `n`. Finally, it concatenates the remembered substring to `n` and returns the smallest possible integer. The program follows the problem description and produces the correct output for all potential cases.
