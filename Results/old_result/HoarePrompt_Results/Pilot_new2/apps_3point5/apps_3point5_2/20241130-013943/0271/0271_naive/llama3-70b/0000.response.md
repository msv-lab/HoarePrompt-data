Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly identifies the nearest integer that ends with 0 to round the input number 'n'. It covers all possible cases where the input number can be rounded down or rounded up to the nearest integer ending with 0. For example, for the input 5, it correctly outputs 0 or 10, both of which are valid according to the problem description. The logic for rounding down or rounding up based on the remainder of n % 10 is correctly implemented. Additionally, it handles the case where n is already an integer ending with 0 by outputting n itself.
