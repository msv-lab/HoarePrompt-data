Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user and then based on the value of `n`, it performs specific calculations and prints a modified version of `n`. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it rounds `n` down to the nearest multiple of 10. The function does not accept any parameters and returns nothing.**
