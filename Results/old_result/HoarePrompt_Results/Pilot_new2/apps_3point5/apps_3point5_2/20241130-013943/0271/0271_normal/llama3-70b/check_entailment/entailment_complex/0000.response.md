Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes an input integer `n` and rounds it to the nearest integer that ends with 0. If `n` is already divisible by 10, it prints the current value of `n` as it is already rounded. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10 by subtracting the remainder of `n` divided by 10 if the remainder is less than or equal to 5, and by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder if the remainder is greater than 5.

The program covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and produces the correct output for each case. So, it is correct.
