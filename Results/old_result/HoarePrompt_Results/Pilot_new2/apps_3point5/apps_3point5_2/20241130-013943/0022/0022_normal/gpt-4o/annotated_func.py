#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string containing only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000.**
def func_1(s):
    n = len(s)
    for i in range(n // 2):
        if s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]:
            return False
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, if the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` in string `s` are equal for all `i`, the function returns True, otherwise it returns False.
    return True
    #The program returns True if the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` in string `s` are equal for all `i`, otherwise it returns False
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts a string `s` containing only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It iterates through the string comparing characters at symmetric positions. If all characters at symmetric positions are equal, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. The function covers both the case when the string is empty and when it has an odd or even length, accurately identifying palindrome strings. However, the function does not handle cases where the input string contains non-English letters or special characters.
