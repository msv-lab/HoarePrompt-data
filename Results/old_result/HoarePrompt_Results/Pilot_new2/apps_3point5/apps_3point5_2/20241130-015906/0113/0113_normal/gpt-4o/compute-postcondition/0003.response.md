The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. The program returns the positive integer x, which is equal to n. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers n and k, and return the positive integer x, which is equal to n.
