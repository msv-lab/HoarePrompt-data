Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `wait_time` are updated based on the conditions in the if else block. If `wait_time` < `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is set to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If the condition is false, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i` remain the same, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
