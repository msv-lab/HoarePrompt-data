#State of the program right berfore the function call: **Precondition**: **n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route, respectively.**
def func_1(n, t, bus_routes):
    min_wait_time = float('inf')
    chosen_route = -1
    for i in range(n):
        s_i, d_i = bus_routes[i]
        
        if s_i >= t:
            wait_time = s_i - t
        elif (t - s_i) % d_i == 0:
            wait_time = 0
        else:
            wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i
        
        if wait_time < min_wait_time:
            min_wait_time = wait_time
            chosen_route = i + 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, `min_wait_time` will contain the minimum wait time calculated for all bus routes. `chosen_route` will be the index of the chosen route with the minimum wait time, starting from 1. All other variables will have their final values based on the loop conditions and calculations.
    return chosen_route
    #The program returns the index of the chosen route with the minimum wait time, starting from 1
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. It iterates through the list of bus routes and calculates the minimum wait time for each route based on the input time `t`. It then determines the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time and returns that index starting from 1. The function aims to assist Serval in choosing the bus route with the shortest wait time. However, the code does not handle scenarios where two bus routes have the same minimum wait time. It selects the first encountered route in such cases.
