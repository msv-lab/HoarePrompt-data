The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route, respectively. 

The function `func_1` returns the index of the chosen route with the minimum wait time, starting from 1. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to determine the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time based on the input parameters `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`, and return the index starting from 1.
