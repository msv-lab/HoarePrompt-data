Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `wait_time` are updated based on the conditions in the if else block. If s_i >= t, `wait_time` is set to s_i - t. If (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `wait_time` are updated and `wait_time` is set to 0. If the condition is false, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `wait_time` are updated and `wait_time` is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i.***
