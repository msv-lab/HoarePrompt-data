Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input and stores the bus routes in a list of tuples.
- The `func_1` function iterates through each bus route and calculates the minimum wait time for Serval based on the input time `t`.
- The code handles scenarios where the first bus of a route arrives after the input time `t`, where the wait time is 0, and where the wait time is calculated based on the time difference between the input time `t` and the arrival time of the first bus of the route.
- The code then selects the bus route with the minimum wait time and returns the corresponding index.

Based on the code and the problem description, it seems that the program handles all cases correctly and the output hints also align with the code's functionality. Hence, the correctness of the program is **True**.
