Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines two functions `func_1` and `func_2` to calculate the greatest common divisor of a list of integers and find all divisors of a given integer in reverse order, respectively.
2. The annotations provide a clear explanation of what each function does and the state of the program before and after the function calls.
3. The problem description is well-defined and the functions adhere to the requirements by correctly calculating the greatest common divisor and finding all divisors of a given integer.
4. The output of the program is the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of the list `A` after the operations, which aligns with the problem description.
5. The code handles the constraints specified in the problem description such as the range of values for `N`, `A_i`, and `K`.
6. The annotations and code logic cover various potential cases such as finding all divisors, calculating the greatest common divisor, and ensuring the correctness of the output.
7. Since no case has been found where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description and the provided annotations, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
