The function `func` reads two integers N, K and a list A of N positive integers. It then calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A. After that, it finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to its square root and prints it. The function does not directly return any value, but it effectively calculates and outputs the maximum divisor of the gcd based on the input values.
