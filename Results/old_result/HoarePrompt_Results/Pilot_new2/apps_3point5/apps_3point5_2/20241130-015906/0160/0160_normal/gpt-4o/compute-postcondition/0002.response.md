Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of N integers, N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, each element of `A` is an integer between 1 and 10^6, `K` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `divisors` is an empty set, `x` must be greater than or equal to 1. For the current values of x, i such that (x % i == 0), are divisors of x***
