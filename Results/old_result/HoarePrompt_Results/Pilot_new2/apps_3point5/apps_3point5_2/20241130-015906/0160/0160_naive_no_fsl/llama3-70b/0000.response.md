Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A, then iterates from 1 to the square root of gcd to find the maximum divisor that satisfies the conditions. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases.
