The function `func` takes user input `s` which is an integer in the range 0 to 99. It then converts this integer into its word representation. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the word equivalent from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. For numbers between 20 and 99, it prints the word representation of the tens place followed by a hyphen and the ones place value if applicable. The function does not return any value but directly prints the word representation.
