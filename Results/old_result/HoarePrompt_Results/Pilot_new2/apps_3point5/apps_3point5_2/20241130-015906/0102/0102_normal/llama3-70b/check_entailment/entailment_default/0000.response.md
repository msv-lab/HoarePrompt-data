Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes an integer input `s` representing Tavas's score and converts it into its word representation. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the word equivalent from the `ones` list. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. For numbers between 20 and 99, it prints the word representation of the tens place followed by a hyphen and the ones place value if applicable. The code appears to cover all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case based on the rules defined. The output hints also align with the code logic and confirm that the code is correctly implementing the task.
