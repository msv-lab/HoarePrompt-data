Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program handles the case where the difference between a and b is 0 by checking if c is 0 and a equals b, and printing 'YES' in that case.
- For other cases, the program calculates whether it is possible for b to appear in the sequence using the given conditions, and prints 'YES' if it is possible, and 'NO' otherwise.
- The program covers all possible scenarios provided in the problem description and gives the correct output for each case.
