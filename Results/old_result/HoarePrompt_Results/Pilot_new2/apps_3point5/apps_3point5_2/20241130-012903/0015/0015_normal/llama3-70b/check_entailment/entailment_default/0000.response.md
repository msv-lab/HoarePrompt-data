Correctness: **True**

The code seems to correctly follow the problem description for all potential cases. The program correctly handles the scenario where the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and non-negative, printing 'YES' in this case. It also correctly handles the scenario where `c` is 0 and checks if `a` is equal to `b`, printing 'YES' accordingly. The logic in the code aligns with the problem description for all the examples provided. Therefore, the code is correct.
