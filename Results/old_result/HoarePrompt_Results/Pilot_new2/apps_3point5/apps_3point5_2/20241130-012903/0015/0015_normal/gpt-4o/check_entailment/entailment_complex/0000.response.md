Correctness: **True**

The program takes three integers as input representing the first element of the sequence, Vasya's favorite number, and the difference between neighboring elements. It then checks if Vasya's favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence, in which case it prints 'YES'. If the favorite number is not equal to the first element, it checks if the difference between the favorite number and the first element is divisible by the difference between the neighboring elements and if the result is non-negative. If both conditions are satisfied, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'.

This logic follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
