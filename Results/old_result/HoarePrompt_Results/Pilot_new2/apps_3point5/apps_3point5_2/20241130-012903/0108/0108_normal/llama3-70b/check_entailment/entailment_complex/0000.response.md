Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads a string consisting of only lowercase English letters and then iterates over the alphabet, replacing each character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet until all 26 characters are included in the result string. If the result string contains all 26 letters, it is printed; otherwise, -1 is printed. This matches the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
