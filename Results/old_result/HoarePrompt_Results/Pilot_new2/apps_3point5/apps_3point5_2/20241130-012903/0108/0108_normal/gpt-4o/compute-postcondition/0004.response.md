According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if both `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of string `target`. 
Right before the loop, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of target, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. 
To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of string `s` and `j` needs to be less than the length of `target`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of target, `i` must be less than the length of `s`, `j` must be less than the length of `target`**
