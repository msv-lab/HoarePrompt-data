Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle the case where the input string already contains the English alphabet in order as a subsequence. For example, if the input string is "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", the program will output "-1" even though no changes are needed as the English alphabet is already present in order. This means the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
