Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of target, `i` must be less than the length of `s`, `j` must be less than the length of `target`. If `(s[i] == target[j])`, then the character at index `i` in `s` matches the character at index `j` in `target`.***
