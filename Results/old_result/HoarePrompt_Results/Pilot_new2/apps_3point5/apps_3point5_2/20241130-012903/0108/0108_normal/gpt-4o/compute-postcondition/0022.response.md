Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of target, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to the length of `target` if all characters of `target` were found in `s`, else `j` is less than the length of `target`. If `j` is equal to `target_len`, the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' is printed. Otherwise, if `j` is not equal to `target_len`, -1 is printed.***
