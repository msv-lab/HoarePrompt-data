According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute another time. At the end of the last iteration, `s` must contain the character `char_next` and `char_next` must not be the last character in the alphabet. This means `char_next` needs to be adjusted to the next character in the alphabet so that the loop can execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` contains the character `char_next` (next character in the alphabet), `char_next` must not be the last character in the alphabet, `res` contains the concatenation of `s` and `char`, `s` now contains the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet, preserving the rest of the characters in `s` intact**
