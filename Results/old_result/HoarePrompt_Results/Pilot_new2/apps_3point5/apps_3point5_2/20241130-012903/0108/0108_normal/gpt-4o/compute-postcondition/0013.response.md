According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `target`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` + 2 and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of target, `i` must be less than the length of `s` + 2, and `j` has either been incremented by 1 or remained the same based on the condition `s[i] == target[j]` after the execution of the if else block. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of `s` + 3 and `j` needs to be less than `target_len`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is the length of target, `i` must be less than the length of `s` + 3, and `j` must be less than `target_len`**
