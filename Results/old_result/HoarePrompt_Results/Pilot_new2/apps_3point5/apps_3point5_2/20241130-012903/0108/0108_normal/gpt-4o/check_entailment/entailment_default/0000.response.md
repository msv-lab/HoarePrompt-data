Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly reads a string `s` and iterates through it to find the characters of the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in the same order. If all characters are found in `s`, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If not, it prints -1. The code follows the problem description and works for all potential cases. The output hints also agree with the code and provide a clear understanding of the code's functionality.
