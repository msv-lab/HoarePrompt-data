According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l`, `r`, and the range from `l` to `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l`, `r`, and `k` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + num) % MOD where num is equal to l, and the range from l to r must have at least one number. 

In order for the loop to execute one more time, the range must include the next number after the previous iteration's `num`. Therefore, the next number after the previous `num` is `num + 1`, and the new states should be adjusted accordingly:
State: **`l` is (num + 1), `r` is r, `k` is k, `total_sum` is updated to (total_sum + num + 1) % MOD**
