Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The function `count` is used to calculate the count of valid numbers within a range and memoizes the results to avoid redundant calculations. The main function correctly computes the difference between the count of valid numbers from $1$ to $r$ and from $1$ to $l-1$ to get the final sum, which is then returned modulo $998244353$. The logic implemented in the program follows the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring correctness.
