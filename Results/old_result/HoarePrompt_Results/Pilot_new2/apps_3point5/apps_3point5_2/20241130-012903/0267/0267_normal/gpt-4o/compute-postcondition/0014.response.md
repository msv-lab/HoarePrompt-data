Functionality: ** The function func_2 accepts three integers l, r, and k with specific constraints and calculates the total sum of all numbers in the range from l to r, including r, where each number satisfies the condition specified by func_1(num, k). The function then returns this total sum. **

Note: The code seems to accurately calculate the total sum based on the conditions specified by func_1(num, k). However, it would be important to verify if func_1(num, k) is defined and functions as expected to ensure the correctness of the functionality.
