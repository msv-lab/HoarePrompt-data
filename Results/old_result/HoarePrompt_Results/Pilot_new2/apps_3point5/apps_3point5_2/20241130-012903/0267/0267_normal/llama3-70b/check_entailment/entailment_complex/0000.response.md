Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided code consists of two functions: `func_1` and `count`. The `func_1` function calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`. It achieves this by utilizing the `count` function to calculate the count of numbers divisible by `k` within certain ranges.

The `count` function efficiently calculates the count of numbers divisible by `k` in a given range using dynamic programming and memoization. It covers different cases such as when `k` is 0, when the pair `(n, k)` is already present in the dictionary `dp`, and when `n < 10 ** k`. The function correctly calculates the count of numbers meeting the specified criteria and stores the results in the dictionary `dp`.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description by correctly calculating the sum of numbers meeting the criteria specified in the problem statement. The annotations provide examples of edge cases that the code handles appropriately. Therefore, the code is deemed correct for all potential cases based on the problem description and the provided examples.
