According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding 9 * 10. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `dp[n, k]` should now include another 9 * 10. 
State: **The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding 9 * 10 again**
