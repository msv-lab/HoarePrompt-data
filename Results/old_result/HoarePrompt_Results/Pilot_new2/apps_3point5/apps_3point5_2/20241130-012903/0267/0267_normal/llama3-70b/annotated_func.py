def func_1(l, r, k):
    dp = {}
    return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
    #The program returns the difference between the count of numbers divisible by k in the range from l to r (inclusive) and the count of numbers divisible by k in the range from 1 to l-1 (exclusive), modulo MOD
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts three integers l, r, and k. It calculates the count of numbers divisible by k in the range from l to r (inclusive) and subtracts the count of numbers divisible by k in the range from 1 to l-1 (exclusive). The result is then returned after taking the modulo MOD.

        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated after all the iterations of the loop have finished according to the formula `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))` for each iteration of the loop, where `i` ranges from 1 to k-1. `n` and `k` maintain their original values.
        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)

    return dp[n, k]
    #The program returns dp[n, k]
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. `n`, `k`, and `dp` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, 1 <= k <= 10, and `dp` is a dictionary. The function calculates and stores values in the dictionary `dp` based on certain conditions. If k is 0, the function returns 0. If the pair (n, k) is already present in the dictionary dp, it returns the corresponding value. Otherwise, it calculates `dp[n, k]` based on the defined formulas and returns the final value stored in dp at key (n, k).
