According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `k`. For the next iteration, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Additionally, the value of `dp[n, k]` needs to be updated as described in the problem statement.
State: **The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated as specified, `i` is incremented by 1**
