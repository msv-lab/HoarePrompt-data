Postcondition: ***n, k, and dp are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is a dictionary where the pair (n, k) is not present. If n < 10 ** k, the dp dictionary now contains the key-value pair (n, k) : n. Otherwise, the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated to `dp[n, k] + (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1), maintaining the original values of `n` and `k`.***
