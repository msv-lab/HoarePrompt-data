Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It takes in three positive integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has. It then calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used to make the compote based on the given ratio of 1:2:4. Finally, it calculates the total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) that can be used to make the compote and prints the result.

For every potential case, the program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay can use to make the compote, following the given ratio.
