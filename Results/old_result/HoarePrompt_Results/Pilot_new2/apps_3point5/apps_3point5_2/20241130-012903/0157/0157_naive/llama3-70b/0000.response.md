Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote. It does this by finding the minimum of the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and one-fourth of the number of pears, as these are the limiting factors based on the given ratio. Then it calculates the total by adding the min_lemon, min_lemon * 2 (apples), and min_lemon * 4 (pears), which satisfies the compote recipe ratio. The program covers all potential cases and produces the correct output as described in the problem statement.
