Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes to form all integers from 1 to x. The program iterates through all possible numbers and checks if it can be formed using the available cube faces. The function `can_form_number` checks if a given number can be formed using the cube faces provided. The program then increments x until it reaches the maximum number that can be formed. The program logic aligns with the problem description, and there are no identified cases where the program does not work as expected.
