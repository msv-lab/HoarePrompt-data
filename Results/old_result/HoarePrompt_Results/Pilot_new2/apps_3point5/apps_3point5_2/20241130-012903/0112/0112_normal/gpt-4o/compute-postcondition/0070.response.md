The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, which is an integer greater than 0. 

After executing the function body, the function returns False under the following conditions:
- Case 1: If no cube was found for any digit in the list `digits` after iterating through all elements and checking for each cube face in `cube_faces`.
- Case 2: If the loop iterated through all elements in `digits` and did not find the next digit `digit` in any of the `cube_faces` lists, leaving `found` as False.
- Case 3: If the program returns False for any other reason not specified in Case 1 or Case 2.

The function returns True under the following condition:
- Case 4: If none of the conditions from Case 1, Case 2, or Case 3 are met.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `num` greater than 0 and return True if certain conditions are met based on iterating through elements in `digits` and checking for cube faces in `cube_faces`, otherwise return False.
