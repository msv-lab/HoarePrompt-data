Postcondition: ***`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num` with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where all elements are set to False except for the element at index i which is set to True, `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is set to True, and `used_cubes[i]` is True. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
