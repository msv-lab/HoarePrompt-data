According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `digits` list and the current `digit`. If there are more digits to iterate through in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True if `digit` is in any of the `cube_faces` lists, and the loop has iterated through all elements in `digits` and checked for each cube face in `cube_faces`. Additionally, `found` is False. So for the loop to execute one more time, the next digit in the list needs to be selected.
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True if `digit` is in any of the `cube_faces` lists, and the loop has iterated through all elements in `digits` and checked for each cube face in `cube_faces`.
