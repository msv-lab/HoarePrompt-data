According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True, `i` is 0.

To execute the loop one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1
- If the cube at the next index `i` has not been used and the `digit` is in the faces of that cube, then `found` will remain True

State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, `found` is True, `i` is 1**
