The code `digits = list(str(num))` converts the integer `num` into a list of its digits. The variable `num` is an integer greater than 0. Therefore, after the code is executed, `digits` will contain a list of the individual digits of the number `num`.

Output State: **num is an integer greater than 0, digits is a list containing the digits of num**
