According to the code, the loop can execute if n is greater than 0. At the start of the loop, the loop index i needs to be adjusted to ensure proper iteration. Since the loop has checked for each cube face in cube_faces, the next cube face needs to be identified. Additionally, the state `found` being False indicates that the loop has not found a match, so it should remain as is. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are: `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, and the next cube face in `cube_faces`.
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where each element represents whether the cube at that index has been used (True) or not (False), `digit` is the next digit in the list `digits`, next cube face in `cube_faces`, `found` is False, i is adjusted accordingly**
