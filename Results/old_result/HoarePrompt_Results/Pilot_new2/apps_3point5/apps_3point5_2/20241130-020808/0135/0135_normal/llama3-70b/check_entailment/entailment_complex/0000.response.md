Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It reads two integers `n` and `k`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`, and checks if any remainder is repeated. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No'. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' indicating that all remainders are distinct.

The program ensures that the remainders are distinct by using a set to keep track of the remainders seen so far. If a remainder is already in the set, it means that it has been seen before, and the program prints 'No'. This logic follows the requirements of the problem description and ensures that the output is correct for all cases.
