Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. `i` is 2. `seen` is a set containing the value 0. `remainder` is the remainder of the division of `n` by 2, which is always 0 if n is even, and 1 if n is odd. If `remainder` is in `seen`, the function does something (specific action not specified)**
