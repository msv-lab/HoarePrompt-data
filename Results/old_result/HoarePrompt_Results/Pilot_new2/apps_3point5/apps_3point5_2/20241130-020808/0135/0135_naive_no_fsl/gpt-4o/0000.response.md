Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given program takes input values n and k, and then checks if all the remainders modulo i (1 ≤ i ≤ k) are distinct. It correctly handles the case where k >= n by returning 'No'. It then uses a set to keep track of the remainders seen so far, and if it encounters a remainder that has already been seen, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The program follows the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
