According to the code, in order for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `x` needs to iterate over the elements in the list `assigned`. At the end of the last iteration, `x` is the last element in the list `assigned`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `x` should be the second last element in the list `assigned`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_i ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the second last element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the second last element of list `a`**
