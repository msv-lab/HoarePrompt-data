Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and sorted in ascending order, `m` is 2. The value of `m` is incremented by 1 after the code snippet has been executed. The condition inside the if statement is met, as `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`.**
