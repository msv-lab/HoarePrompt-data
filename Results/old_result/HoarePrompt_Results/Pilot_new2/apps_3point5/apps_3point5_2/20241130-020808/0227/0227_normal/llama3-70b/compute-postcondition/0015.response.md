Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and sorted in ascending order, `m` is the number of times `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1] * 2` as `i` iterated over the range 1 to `n`. The value of `m` is printed if `m` is less than or equal to 23, otherwise -1 is printed.**
