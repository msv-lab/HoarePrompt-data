Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the described sequence of operations based on the input sequence `a`. It iterates through the sorted input sequence `a` and checks if each element is double the previous element. If not, it increments the variable `m`. Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise, it prints -1.

The program covers all possible cases and correctly calculates the minimum number of variables required to perform the sequence of operations as described in the problem.
