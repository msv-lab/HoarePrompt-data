Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, `a`, `b` are integers obtained from the input split, `a_floor` is equal to the remainder of (a - 1) divided by m plus 1, `a_block` is calculated as specified above, `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` is assigned the minimum value between the absolute difference of a_block and b_block or n minus the absolute difference of a_block and b_block, multiplied by 15. Additionally, `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`. `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10.**
