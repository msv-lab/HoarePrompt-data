The function `func` reads input values for n, m, k, a, b, and performs calculations based on these values. It calculates `a_floor` and `a_block` based on the input, then calculates `b_floor` and `b_block`. It determines `min_block_time` as the minimum time between blocks multiplied by 15. Additionally, it calculates `min_floor_time` based on the floors of a and b. The function then prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`. It handles cases where a_floor is greater than b_floor and vice versa to calculate the appropriate `min_floor_time`. The function does not return any value.
