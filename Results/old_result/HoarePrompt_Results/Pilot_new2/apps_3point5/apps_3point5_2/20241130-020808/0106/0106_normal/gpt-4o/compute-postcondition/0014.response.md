Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts five parameters `n, m, k, a, b`, where `n, m, k, a, and b` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. Additionally, `a` and `b` are distinct numbers. The function calculates the total time taken to move from location `a` to location `b`, considering the floor and block numbers of the locations, as well as walking times and exit times. The total time includes the time to exit, minimum walk time between blocks, and time to reach the target floor.**

Potential Edge Cases:
1. The function does not handle any error cases like invalid inputs.
2. If the floor numbers of locations `a` and `b` are the same, the function does not account for the time to move between floors.
