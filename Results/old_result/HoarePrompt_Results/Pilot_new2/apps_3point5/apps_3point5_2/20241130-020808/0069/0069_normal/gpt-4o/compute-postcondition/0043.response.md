Output State: `x` is an integer obtained from the value of `data` at index 1, `T` remains greater than 0, `index` is 3, `results` contains either -1 or 0 based on whether `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `n` is an integer obtained from the value of `data` at index 0, `s` is a string obtained from the value of `data` at index 2, `balance` is correctly calculated and remains 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of n+1 integers fully updated with the correct values after the loop finishes execution, count variable has been appended to the results list.
The value of `s` is assigned the value of `data` at index + 2.
