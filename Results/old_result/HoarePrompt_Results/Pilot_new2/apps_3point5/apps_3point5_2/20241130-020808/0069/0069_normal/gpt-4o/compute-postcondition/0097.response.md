According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `prefix_balances` list. Since `i` is equal to `n`, the loop will only run if `n` is greater than or equal to 0. The loop body does not affect the state.

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **prefix_balances is a list of n+1 integers fully updated with the correct values, i is equal to n, n is greater than or equal to 0, each element in prefix_balances is the sum of the previous element and 1 if the corresponding element in string s is '0', otherwise it subtracts 1 from the previous element, balance is not equal to 0, count is 0**
