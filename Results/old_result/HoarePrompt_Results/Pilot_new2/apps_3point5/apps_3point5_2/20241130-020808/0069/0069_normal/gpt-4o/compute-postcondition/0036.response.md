Postcondition: ***All the variables are correctly initialized and updated as required. If ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) evaluates to true, then count is increased by 2. The state of the program variables remains consistent with the preconditions after the execution of the if-else block.***
