According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `fractions`. If there are still fractions left to iterate over, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `fraction` is either 'D' or not 'D'. If `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is 1 and `remocrats` is 0. If `fraction` is not 'D', `depublicans` is 0 and `remocrats` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more fraction left to iterate over.
State: **n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, fractions is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction to iterate over**
