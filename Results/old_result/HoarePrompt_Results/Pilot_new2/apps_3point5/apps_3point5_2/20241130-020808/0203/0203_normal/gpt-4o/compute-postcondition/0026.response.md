Postcondition: ***n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, votes is a non-empty string, d_queue and r_queue are not empty. If d_index < r_index, then a new element is added to d_queue which is equal to the previous d_index plus n. If d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, then r_queue has r_index + n appended to it.***
