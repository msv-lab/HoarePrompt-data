According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more fractions left in the `fractions` string. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is still within the valid range, and there is at least one more fraction to iterate over. If the last fraction was 'D', then `depublicans` was increased by 1. If the last fraction was not 'D', then `remocrats` was increased by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next fraction in the string needs to be considered:
- If the next fraction is 'D', then `depublicans` will be increased by 1 in the next iteration.
- If the next fraction is not 'D', then `remocrats` will be increased by 1 in the next iteration.

State: **n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, fractions is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction to iterate over, next fraction will determine if depublicans or remocrats will be increased**
