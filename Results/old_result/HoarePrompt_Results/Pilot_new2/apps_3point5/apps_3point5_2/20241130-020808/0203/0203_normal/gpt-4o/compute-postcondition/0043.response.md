Output State: **n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, votes is a non-empty string. d_queue and r_queue are empty. d_index and r_index are not affected by the code snippet as the print statement does not manipulate any variables. The loop will not execute as the conditions for the loop are not met. Since the program enters the else block after the loop, the output state remains unchanged.**
