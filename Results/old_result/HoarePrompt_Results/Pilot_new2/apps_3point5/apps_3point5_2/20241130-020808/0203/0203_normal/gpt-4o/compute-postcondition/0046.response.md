Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `votes` representing employees from either 'D' (depublicans) or 'R' (remocrats). It then assigns the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters to separate queues based on their appearance order. The function simulates a process where 'D' and 'R' employees are removed from their respective queues at the same time and added back with an offset of `n`. After this simulation, if the 'D' queue is not empty, it prints 'D'; otherwise, it prints 'R'.**
