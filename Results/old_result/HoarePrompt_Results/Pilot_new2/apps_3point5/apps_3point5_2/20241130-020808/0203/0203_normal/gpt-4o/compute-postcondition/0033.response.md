According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` is not empty, `d_index` is the first element removed from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the first element removed from `r_queue`, and the condition `d_index < r_index` is satisfied. For the loop to execute one more time, `d_queue` needs to have a new element added which is equal to `d_index + n`, and `r_queue` needs to contain the result of appending the value of `r_index + n`.
State: **n is an input integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, votes is a non-empty string, d_queue has a new element added which is equal to d_index + n, r_queue contains the result of appending the value of r_index + n**
