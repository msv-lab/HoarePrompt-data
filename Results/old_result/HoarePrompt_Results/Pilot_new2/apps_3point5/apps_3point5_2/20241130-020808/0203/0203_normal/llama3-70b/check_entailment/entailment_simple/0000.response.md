Correctness: **True**

The program correctly counts the number of 'D' and 'R' fractions in the input string and determines the outcome of the vote based on which count is higher. This aligns with the problem description where the outcome is determined by the fraction with the higher count. The program also handles the case where the counts are equal by printing 'R', which is also consistent with the problem description. Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
