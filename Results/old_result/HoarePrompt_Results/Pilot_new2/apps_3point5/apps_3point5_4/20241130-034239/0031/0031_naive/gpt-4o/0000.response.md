Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It uses the formula for calculating combinations and takes care of reducing the fractions to their simplest form by finding the greatest common divisor. The program also handles cases where k is greater than 2^n and outputs 1 1 as per the problem description. The code seems to cover all potential cases and provides the correct output as expected.
