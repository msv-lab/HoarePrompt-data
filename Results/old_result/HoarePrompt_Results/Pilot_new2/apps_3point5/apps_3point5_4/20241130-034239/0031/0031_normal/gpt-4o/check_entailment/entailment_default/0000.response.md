Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_2` correctly handles the calculation of the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday in Udayland as described in the problem statement. It calculates the numerator and denominator using modulo arithmetic and then reduces the fraction to its irreducible form. The code also accounts for the edge case where `k` is greater than the total number of days in a year `2^n` by directly printing `1 1`, as it is guaranteed that two people will share a birthday in such a scenario. 
- The output hints also align with the code's functionality. The hints provide insight into the computations performed by the function and validate the correctness of the code. Therefore, based on the code and the description provided, the program seems correct for all potential cases.
