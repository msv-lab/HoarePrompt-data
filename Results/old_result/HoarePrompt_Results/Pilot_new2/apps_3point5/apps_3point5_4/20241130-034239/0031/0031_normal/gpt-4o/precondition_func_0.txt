**Input**: The input consists of two integers, \(n\) and \(k\) (1 ≤ \(n\) ≤ \(10^{18}\), 2 ≤ \(k\) ≤ \(10^{18}\), representing the number of days in a year (2^n) and the number of people interviewed (k) by ZS the Coder.

**Output**: The output should be two integers, A and B, representing the irreducible fraction A/B where A and B are coprime and must be printed modulo 10^6 + 3.
