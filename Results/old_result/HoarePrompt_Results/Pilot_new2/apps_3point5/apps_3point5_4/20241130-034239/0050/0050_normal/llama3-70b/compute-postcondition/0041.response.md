Output State: **If shares > 0, `r` is updated to its initial value plus the product of `shares` and the sum of `i` elements from the list `b`. All other variables remain unchanged except `i` which becomes equal to m, and `shares` is set to 0. If shares <= 0, all variables remain unchanged and the loop does not execute.**
