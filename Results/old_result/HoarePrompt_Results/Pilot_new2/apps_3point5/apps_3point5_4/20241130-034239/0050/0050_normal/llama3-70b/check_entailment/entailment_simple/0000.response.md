Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It first buys shares in the morning by iteratively choosing the maximum number of shares that can be bought at each price until the money runs out. Then it sells the shares in the evening, maximizing the profit by selling at the highest possible price. The final result is the maximum number of bourles that can be held after the evening, which is printed out.

The program handles all possible cases where the number of ways to buy shares, the number of ways to sell shares, and the initial number of bourles fall within the specified constraints. It considers all possible combinations of buying and selling shares to maximize profit, as described in the problem.
