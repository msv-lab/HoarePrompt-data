Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= `n` <= 30, 1 <= `m` <= 30, 1 <= `r` <= 1000. `s_i` and `b_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= `s_i`, `b_i` <= 1000. `s` is a list of integers created by mapping the input split by space to integers. `b` is a list of integers created by mapping the input split by space to integers. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`. `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b` and `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`. 

`max_shares` is assigned the value of the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`.
