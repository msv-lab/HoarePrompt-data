Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two non-negative integers a and b as input correctly.
2. It removes leading zeroes from both a and b.
3. It then compares the length of a and b, and if they are not equal, it correctly prints "<" if a is less than b and ">" if a is greater than b.
4. If the lengths are equal, it compares the values of a and b as strings and prints "<", ">", or "=" accordingly.
5. The program handles the case where a or b is '0' correctly.
6. The program handles very large integers with up to 10^6 digits as specified in the problem description.
