Correctness: True

Explanation: The program reads two non-negative integers a and b as input and removes any leading zeroes. It then compares the two numbers and prints the symbol "<" if a < b, ">" if a > b, and "=" if a = b. The program correctly handles the comparison of the numbers as per the problem description for all the given examples. It covers the cases where the numbers are equal, a < b, and a > b, making it a correct solution.
