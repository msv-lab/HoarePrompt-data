Postcondition: ***'a', 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros. If 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. If 'a' is '0' and 'b' is '0', the function evaluates to False. The length of 'a' is greater than or equal to the length of 'b'. If the length of 'a' is greater than the length of 'b', the program executes the if part. If the length of 'a' is not greater than the length of 'b', the program executes the else part. In the if part, the current length of 'a' is greater than the length of 'b' and if 'a' is less than 'b', no change occurs in 'a' and 'b'. If 'a' is greater than or equal to 'b', 'a' and 'b' are non-negative integers with no leading zeros, where 'b' is '0', then the function evaluates to False, and 'a' is not greater than 'b'.***
