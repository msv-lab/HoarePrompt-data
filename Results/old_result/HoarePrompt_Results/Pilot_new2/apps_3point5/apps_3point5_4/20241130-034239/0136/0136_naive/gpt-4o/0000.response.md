Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers a and b as strings and removes any leading zeroes. It then compares the lengths of a and b, and if they are not equal, it prints "<" if a is shorter or ">" if b is shorter. If the lengths are equal, it compares the two strings directly and prints "<", ">", or "=" accordingly. The program handles the case where a and b have leading zeroes properly and compares the numbers correctly without converting them to integers, which is suitable for very large integers. The code covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
