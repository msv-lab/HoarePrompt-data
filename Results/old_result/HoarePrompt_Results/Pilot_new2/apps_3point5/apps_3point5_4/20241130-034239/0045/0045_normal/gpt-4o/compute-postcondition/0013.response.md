According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `k` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is equal to k * (k + 1) // 2, the minimum sum is less than or equal to n, `d` is equal to n divided by min_sum, `remainder` is the value of n minus d times min_sum - 1, `sequence` is a list containing k elements where each element is equal to d times (i + 1) + 1 for i in range(k). If the current value of `remainder` is 0, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` in the `range` function should be adjusted. Since the loop is going in reverse order with step -1, the next `i` should be `i - 1` to continue the iteration.
State: **`n`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to k * (k + 1) // 2, the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to n divided by min_sum, `remainder` is the value of n minus d times min_sum - 1, `sequence` is a list containing `k` elements where each element is equal to d times (i + 1) + 1 for i in range(k), `i` is adjusted to be `i - 1` for the next iteration.**
