#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10.**
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: Output State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10, a is now equal to the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of n and k, b is now equal to 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the positive integers n and k
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two positive integers a and b, calculates their greatest common divisor (GCD) using the Euclidean algorithm, and returns the GCD. The function correctly determines the GCD of the input values a and b by iteratively swapping and calculating remainders until b becomes 0. The function does not handle edge cases where either a or b is zero or negative as specified in the annotations.
