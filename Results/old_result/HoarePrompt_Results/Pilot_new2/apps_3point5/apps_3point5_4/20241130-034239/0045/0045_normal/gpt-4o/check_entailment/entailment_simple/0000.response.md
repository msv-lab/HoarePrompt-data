Correctness: **True**

The program creates a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers such that their sum is equal to `n` and the greatest common divisor is maximized. It first calculates the minimum sum that can be obtained with a strictly increasing sequence of length `k`, if this sum is greater than `n`, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the value `d` which represents how many times the minimum sum can fit in `n`. It then calculates the remainder and adjusts the sequence to distribute the remainder among the elements of the sequence such that it remains strictly increasing.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and always produces a sequence of positive numbers that satisfies the requirements mentioned in the problem statement.
