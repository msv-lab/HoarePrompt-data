According to the code, the loop will always execute because the range is defined from k-1 to 0 (inclusive) with a step of -1. Therefore, the loop will execute for k iterations. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
- `n` and `k` remain positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10.
- `min_sum` is equal to k * (k + 1) // 2.
- The minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`.
- `d` is equal to n divided by min_sum.
- `remainder` is the value of n minus d times min_sum.
- `sequence` is a list containing `k` elements where each element is equal to d times (i + 1) for i in range(k).

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to k * (k + 1) // 2, the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to n divided by min_sum, `remainder` is the value of n minus d times min_sum, `sequence` is a list containing `k` elements where each element is equal to d times (i + 1) for i in range(k)**
