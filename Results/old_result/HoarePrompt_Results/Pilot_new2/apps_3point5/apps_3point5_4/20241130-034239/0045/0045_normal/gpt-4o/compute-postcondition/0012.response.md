Output State: `n`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to k * (k + 1) // 2, the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n`, `d` is equal to n divided by min_sum, `remainder` is the value of n minus d times min_sum - 1, `sequence` is a list containing `k` elements where each element is equal to d times (i + 1) + 1 for i in range(k). If the current value of `remainder` is 0, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
