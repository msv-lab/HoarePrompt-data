According to the code, the loop continues executing as long as the value of `b` is truthy, which means it is not equal to 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `b` should be non-zero at the end of the previous iteration. Since `a` is now equal to the previous value of `a` modulo `b` and `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a`, the loop will execute one more time if the new values of `a` and `b` result in a non-zero value for `b`.

State: **Output State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10, a is now equal to the previous value of a modulo b, b is now equal to the previous value of a, b must be non-zero for the loop to execute one more time**
