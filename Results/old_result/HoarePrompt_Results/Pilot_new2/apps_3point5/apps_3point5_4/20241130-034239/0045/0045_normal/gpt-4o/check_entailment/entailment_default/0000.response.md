Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `func_1` that takes two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`, where 1 <= n, k <= 10^10.
- If the minimum sum calculated based on parameter `k` exceeds `n`, the function returns -1, as specified in the problem description.
- Otherwise, the function constructs a list `sequence` containing `k` elements. Each element in the list is equal to the original `d` multiplied by (i + 1) for i in range(k).
- The code correctly handles the case where the minimum sum is less than or equal to `n` and constructs the `sequence` list accordingly.
- The output hints also agree with the code and accurately describe the functionality of the `func_1` function.
