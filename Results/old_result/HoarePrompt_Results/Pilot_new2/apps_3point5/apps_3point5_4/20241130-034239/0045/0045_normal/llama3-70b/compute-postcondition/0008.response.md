The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^10. After executing the function body, the program returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the positive integers `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return their greatest common divisor (GCD). 
Functionality: **The function accepts two positive integers a and b, and returns their greatest common divisor (GCD).**
