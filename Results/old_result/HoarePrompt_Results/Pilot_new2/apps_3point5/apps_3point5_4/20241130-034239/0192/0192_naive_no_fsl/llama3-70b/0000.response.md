Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes two integers `x` and `y` as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It then calculates and prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`, which represents the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length `y` from the starting equilateral triangle of side length `x`. This logic aligns with the problem description, as it accurately calculates the minimum number of seconds needed to achieve the desired triangle side length. 

All the provided examples are correctly solved by the program as well.
