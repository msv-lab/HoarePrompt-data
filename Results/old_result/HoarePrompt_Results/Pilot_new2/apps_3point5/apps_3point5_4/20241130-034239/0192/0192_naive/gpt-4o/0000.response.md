Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y based on the given starting side length x. It calculates this by taking the absolute difference between x and y, dividing it by 2, and then adding the remainder if the difference is odd. This logic aligns with the problem description and works for all potential cases within the given constraints.
