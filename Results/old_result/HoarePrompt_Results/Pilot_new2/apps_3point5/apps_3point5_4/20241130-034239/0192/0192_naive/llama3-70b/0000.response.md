Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. This is achieved by simply calculating the absolute difference between x and y, as in each second Memory can modify the length of a single side of the triangle. This logic holds true for all possible values of x and y within the given constraints, ensuring the correctness of the program.
