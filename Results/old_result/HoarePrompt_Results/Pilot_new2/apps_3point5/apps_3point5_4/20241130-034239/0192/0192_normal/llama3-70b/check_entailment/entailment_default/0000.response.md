Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads two integer inputs x and y, where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, computes the absolute difference between x and y, and prints the result. This directly aligns with the problem description where Memory wants to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y from x. The code is simple and straightforward, and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the code does not handle. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the desired equilateral triangle.
