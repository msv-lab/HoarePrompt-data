According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1, `j` is less than the length of 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and the character at index `i` in string `s` is equal to the character at index `j` in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of string `s` after increasing by 1, and `j` should still be less than the length of 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
State: **s is a string consisting of |s| small English letters where 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5, target is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', target_len is the length of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', i needs to be less than len(s) after increasing by 1, j needs to be less than target_len**
