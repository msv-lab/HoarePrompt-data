According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the `alphabet`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is not present in `s` anymore as it was replaced by consecutive characters in the alphabet. To execute the loop one more time, the next character in the `alphabet` that has not been replaced in `s` needs to be selected.
State: **`s` is a string with all occurrences of the next character in `alphabet` replaced by consecutive characters in the alphabet, `res` is updated to include the next unique character replaced, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` that is not present in `s`**
