The loop processes each character in the string `s` by replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The loop continues as long as `char` is present in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string with all occurrences of `char` replaced by consecutive characters in the alphabet, `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters, `res` is the concatenation of all unique characters that were replaced, `char` is not present in `s` anymore**
