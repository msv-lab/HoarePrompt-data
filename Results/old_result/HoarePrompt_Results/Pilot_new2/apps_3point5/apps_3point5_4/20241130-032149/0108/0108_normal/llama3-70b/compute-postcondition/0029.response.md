According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is in `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` should still be in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string with all occurrences of the next character in `alphabet` replaced by consecutive characters in the alphabet, `res` includes all unique characters replaced in consecutive iterations, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` that is not present in `s` and `char` is in `s`**
