Correctness: **True**

The program reads a string `s` and iterates through the alphabet, constructing a string `res` that contains all lowercase English letters in consecutive order by replacing occurrences in `s`. If the length of `res` becomes 26, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. This matches the problem description perfectly. The program ensures that the output string will contain the English alphabet as a subsequence or it will indicate that it is impossible.
