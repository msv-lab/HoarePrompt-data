Correctness: **True**

The program takes a string `s` as input, then iterates over the characters in `s` and compares them to the characters in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If the characters match in order, it increments the index `j`. If at the end of the loop `j` is equal to the length of the target string, it means that the input string `s` can be rearranged to form the English alphabet as a subsequence, so it prints out 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `j` is less than the length of the target string, it means it is impossible to rearrange `s` to form the English alphabet as a subsequence, so it prints out -1.

The program follows the problem description accurately, as it checks if the given string `s` can be rearranged to form the English alphabet as a subsequence. If it can, it prints out the rearranged string, otherwise it prints -1.
