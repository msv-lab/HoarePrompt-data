Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program takes an input string and iterates through both the input string and the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
2. It checks if the characters in the input string match the characters in the target string, moving to the next character in the target string only if there is a match.
3. If the program successfully iterates through both strings and matches all characters in the target string, it prints the target string. Otherwise, it prints -1.
4. The program logic correctly determines if it is possible to obtain a string with the English alphabet as a subsequence from the given input string.
