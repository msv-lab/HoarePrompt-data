According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the character `char` being present in the string `s`. Right before the loop, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters and `char` is not defined. The loop will execute if `char` is one of the lowercase English letters. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `char` must be initialized to a lowercase English letter that is present in the string `s`.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters from 'a' to 'z', `res` is an empty string, `char` must be initialized to a lowercase English letter present in `s`**
