Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- If c is equal to 0, then the sequence will be a, a+c, a+2c, a+3c, ... and so on. If a is equal to b, then b will be in the sequence, hence the program prints 'YES'. If a is not equal to b, then b will not be in the sequence, hence the program prints 'NO'.
- If c is not equal to 0, then the sequence will be a, a+c, a+2c, a+3c, ... and so on. If there exists an integer k such that b = a + kc, then b will be in the sequence, hence the program prints 'YES'. If there is no integer k that satisfies the equation, then b will not be in the sequence, hence the program prints 'NO'.
