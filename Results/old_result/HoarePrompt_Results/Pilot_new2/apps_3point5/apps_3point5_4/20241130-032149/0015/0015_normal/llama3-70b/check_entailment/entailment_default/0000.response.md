Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the problem description. 
- If the difference between the favorite number b and the first element a is divisible by the difference between the neighboring elements c and is non-negative, then the code prints 'YES', which indicates that the favorite number b appears in the sequence. 
- If c is 0 and a is equal to b, the code also prints 'YES', which covers the case where the favorite number is the same as the first element of the sequence. 
- If none of the above conditions are met, the code prints 'NO', indicating that the favorite number does not appear in the sequence. 

The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly following the problem description for all potential cases.
