The program follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases. It correctly determines if Vasya's favorite number b appears in the sequence based on the given values of a, b, and c. It prints "YES" if b appears in the sequence and "NO" if it does not, as required by the problem description. The program handles the cases where c is 0 and where c is not 0 as specified in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
