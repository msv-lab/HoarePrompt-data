Postcondition: ***a, b, and c are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. If c == 0, then if a is equal to b, a and b retain their values. If a is not equal to b, a and b remain not equal, and 'NO' has been printed. If c is not equal to 0, then if (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0, 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
