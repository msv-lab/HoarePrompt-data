#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, 1 <= k <= 10.**
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns True if the number of unique digits in the integer n is less than or equal to k, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two integers n and k. It returns True if the number of unique digits in n is less than or equal to k; otherwise, it returns False. The function correctly checks if the number of unique digits in n is less than or equal to k based on the given condition.

    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, `l` is an integer such that 1 <= l < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is updated to the sum of all numbers `num` in the range [l, r] such that `func_1(num, k)` is true, calculated as `(total_sum + num) % MOD` for each valid `num`. If `func_1(num, k)` is false for all numbers in the range [l, r], `total_sum` remains 0.
    return total_sum
    #The program returns the updated total_sum which is the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] such that func_1(num, k) is true, calculated as (total_sum + num) % MOD for each valid num. If func_1(num, k) is false for all numbers in the range [l, r], total_sum remains 0
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts three integer parameters l, r, and k satisfying specific constraints (1 <= l <= r < 10^18, 1 <= k <= 10). It iterates through the range [l, r] and for each number checks if func_1(num, k) returns true. If true, it updates total_sum by adding the number and taking the modulo MOD. The function then returns the updated total_sum, which represents the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] for which func_1(num, k) is true. If no numbers satisfy the condition, total_sum remains 0 after the calculation.
