The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`, all of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. 

The function returns the updated `total_sum`, which is the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] such that `func_1(num, k)` is true. The calculation for the updated `total_sum` is performed as (total_sum + num) % MOD for each valid `num`. If `func_1(num, k)` is false for all numbers in the range [l, r], the `total_sum` remains 0.

Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters l, r, and k satisfying specific constraints. It returns the updated total_sum, which is the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] for which func_1(num, k) is true. If no such numbers exist, total_sum remains 0 after the calculation.**
