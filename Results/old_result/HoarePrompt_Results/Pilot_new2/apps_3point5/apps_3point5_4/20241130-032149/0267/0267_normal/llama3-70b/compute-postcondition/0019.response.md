Postcondition: ***n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. dp is a dictionary. k is not equal to 0. If n < 10 ** k, dp[n, k] = n. If n >= 10 ** k, k is greater than 1, i is k, dp[n, k] = 9 + 9 * 10 + 9 * 10 + ... (k times), dp[n, k] will be updated based on the calculation dp[n, k] += (10^(i-1)) * 9.***
