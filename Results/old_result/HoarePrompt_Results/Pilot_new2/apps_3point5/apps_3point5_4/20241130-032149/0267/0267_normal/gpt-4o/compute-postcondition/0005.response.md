According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range `[l, r]`. At the end of the last iteration, `l`, `r`, and `k` are within the specified ranges. To execute the loop one more time, the next value of `num` should be considered. Since the loop increments `num` by 1 in each iteration, for the next iteration, the value of `num` should be `num + 1`.

Therefore, for the next iteration:
State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= l < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, total_sum is 0**.
