The function does not accept any parameters. It reads three positive integers a, b, and c from the user input (1 <= a, b, c <= 1000). It then calculates the minimum of a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4, assigns it to min_lemon, and prints the result of min_lemon added to itself multiplied by 2 and 4.
