Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads three positive integers a, b, and c and calculates the minimum number of fruits that can be used to cook the compote. It then prints the total number of fruits which is the minimum number of lemons added to itself multiplied by 2 and 4, as required in the problem description. It covers all possible cases and provides the correct output for each case.
