Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The code reads three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input (1 <= a, b, c <= 1000) and calculates the minimum of `a`, `b` divided by 2, and `c` divided by 4, assigns it to `min_lemon`, and prints the result of `min_lemon` added to itself multiplied by 2 and 4. This logic correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The code ensures that the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay can use in the compote is in the ratio of 1:2:4, and it handles scenarios where Nikolay may not have enough fruits to make a compote. The examples provided in the description also confirm that the code gives the correct output in those cases. Therefore, the code is correct.
