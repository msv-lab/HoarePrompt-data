Postcondition: ***`num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 1 element, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `found` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is less than `n`, and if not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i] condition is met, then `found` is True and the loop or if statement is exited.***
