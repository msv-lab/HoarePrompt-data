Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The main issue lies in the `can_form_number` function. This function takes a list of n tuples as input, where each tuple contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of a cube. However, the problem description specifies that each cube contains exactly one digit from 0 to 9 on each face, not a tuple of 6 integers. This discrepancy between the input format of the function and the required format from the problem description indicates that the code is not correctly implementing the problem requirements.

Additionally, the `can_form_number` function uses a variable `n` that is not explicitly defined within its scope, which could lead to runtime errors.

Therefore, the code is incorrect according to the problem description.
