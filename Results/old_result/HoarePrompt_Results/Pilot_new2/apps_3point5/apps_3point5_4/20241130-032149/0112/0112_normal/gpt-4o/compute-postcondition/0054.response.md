According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values with the current value of `used_cubes[i]` being True, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. The current value of `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

To adjust for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be modified as follows:
State: **`num` is a list of n tuples, `digits` is a list of strings with at least 2 elements, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values with the current value of `used_cubes[i]` being True, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1. The current value of `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**.
