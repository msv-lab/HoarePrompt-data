Correctness: **False**

The annotated program provided does not fully implement the problem description. The `func_1` function seems to be calculating the maximum number x that Masha can make, but the `can_form_number` function is not properly implemented to check if a number can be formed using the given cubes. The `can_form_number` function is incomplete and does not accurately determine if a number can be formed using the cube faces provided.

Therefore, the program does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
