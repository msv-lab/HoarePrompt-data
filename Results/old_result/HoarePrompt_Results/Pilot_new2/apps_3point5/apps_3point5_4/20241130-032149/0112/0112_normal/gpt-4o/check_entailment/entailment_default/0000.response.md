Correctness: **True**

Upon reviewing the code and the problem description, it seems that the program is correctly addressing the task at hand. The function `func_1` iterates over the cubes to create a list of sets representing the unique digits on each cube face. Then, it incrementally increases the value of x until it satisfies the condition `can_form_number(x + n)`, and finally returns the value of x.

The `can_form_number` function correctly checks if a given number can be formed using the cube faces. It iterates through the digits in the number and verifies if each digit can be formed using the cube faces. If a digit cannot be formed, it returns False, otherwise, it returns True.

Given that the code logic aligns with the problem description and the output hints do not provide any contradicting information, we can conclude that the code is correct for all potential cases.
