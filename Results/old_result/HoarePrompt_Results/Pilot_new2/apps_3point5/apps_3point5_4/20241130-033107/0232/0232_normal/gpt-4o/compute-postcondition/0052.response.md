Output State: **Each color in `current_counts` has a value greater than or equal to the corresponding desired count except for at least one color. `left` is incremented by the total number of iterations plus 2. `right` is incremented by 1. `current_counts[colors[right]]` is increased by the total number of iterations plus 2. `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by the total number of iterations plus 3. Additionally, there exists at least one color where `current_counts[color]` is not equal to `desired_counts[color`. If all colors in `current_counts` are equal to their corresponding desired counts, the program returns 'YES'.**
