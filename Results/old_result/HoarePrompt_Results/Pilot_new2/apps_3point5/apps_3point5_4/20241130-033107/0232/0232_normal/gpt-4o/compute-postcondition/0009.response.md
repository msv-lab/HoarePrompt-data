Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary with keys from 1 to `m` (inclusive) and values as `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with all values initialized to 0 except `colors[right]` which is incremented by 1, `left` is 0, `right` will iterate from 0 to n-1 and at least one color in `current_counts` is less than the corresponding `desired_counts` for the colors. The value of `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by 1.**
