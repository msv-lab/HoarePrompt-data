Postcondition: ***Each color in `current_counts` must have a value greater than or equal to the corresponding desired count except for at least one color, `left` is incremented by 2, `current_counts[colors[right]]` is increased by 1, and `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 2. If all colors in `current_counts` match the desired counts, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the program is unaffected.***
