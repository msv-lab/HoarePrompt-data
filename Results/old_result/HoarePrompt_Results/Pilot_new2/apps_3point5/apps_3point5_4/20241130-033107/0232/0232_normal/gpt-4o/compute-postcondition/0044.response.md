Postcondition: ***Each color in `current_counts` has a value greater than or equal to the corresponding desired count except for at least one color. `left` has been incremented by the total number of iterations. `current_counts[colors[right]]` has been increased by the total number of iterations plus 1. `current_counts[colors[left]]` has been decreased by the total number of iterations plus 1. `right` has been incremented by 1. The condition (all((current_counts[color] == desired_counts[color] for color in desired_counts))) is true, indicating that all colors in `current_counts` now have the desired counts.***
