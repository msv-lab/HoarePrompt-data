Output State: **At the end of the loop execution, `found` is True. The loop will break at some index `i` and `j` will be equal to `n`. `window_counts` will contain each color from `colors[i]` to `colors[n-1]` with their respective counts sorted in the same order as the corresponding targets in `counts`. `color_counts` will remain the same as the original dictionary.**
