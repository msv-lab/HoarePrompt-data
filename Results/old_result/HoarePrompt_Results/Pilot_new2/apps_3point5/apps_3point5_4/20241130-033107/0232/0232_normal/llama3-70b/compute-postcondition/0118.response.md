Functionality: **The function reads input values for the number of lightsabers and their colors, processes the data to check if there exists a subsequence of colors that matches the desired counts, and prints 'YES' if such a subsequence is found, 'NO' otherwise. The function handles cases where the desired counts are not achievable or where the provided input does not meet the constraints.**
