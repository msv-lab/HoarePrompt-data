Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `j` is increased by 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 0 if color is not in `window_counts`, `window_counts` contains the key `color` with a value of 1 if color is in `window_counts`, all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts` in a sorted manner, `color_counts` remain the same, `color` is the color at index 2 in the list `colors`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
