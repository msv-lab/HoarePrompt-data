Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the problem description. It iterates over the colors and keeps track of the counts of each color. It checks if the current counts match the desired counts and returns 'YES' if they do. If the loop finishes without meeting the conditions, it returns 'NO'. The logic in the code aligns with the requirements specified in the problem description, making the program correct.
