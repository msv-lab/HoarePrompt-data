Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly checks if a given string is an "s-palindrome" by iterating through the string and comparing characters from the beginning with characters from the end. If at any point there is a mismatch, the program returns False indicating that the string is not an "s-palindrome". If the entire string is iterated through without any mismatches, the program returns True indicating that the string is an "s-palindrome". The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it covers all potential cases where the string may not be symmetrical about the middle. Therefore, the program is correct.
