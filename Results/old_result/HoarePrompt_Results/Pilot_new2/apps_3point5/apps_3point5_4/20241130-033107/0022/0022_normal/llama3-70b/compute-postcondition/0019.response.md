Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string `s` consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive. It then checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end of the string. If the characters do not match, it sets `is_palindrome` to False and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'TAK' if `s` is a palindrome, otherwise 'NIE'. The function does not return any value explicitly.**
