According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length at least 2 consisting of only English letters, `n` is an even number, and the characters at index `i` and `n - 1 - i` in string `s` are equal. To execute the loop one more time, the index `i` needs to be increased by 1, so the new index `i` will be `i + 1` and since `n` is even, `n` must be greater than `2(i + 1)` for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2 consisting of only English letters, `n` is an even number greater than `2(i + 1)`, the characters at index `i + 1` and `n - 1 - (i + 1)` in string `s` are equal**
