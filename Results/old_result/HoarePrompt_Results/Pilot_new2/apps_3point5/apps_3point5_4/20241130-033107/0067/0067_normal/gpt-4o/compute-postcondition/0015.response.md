Functionality: **The function `func` reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z within the range 0 to 100. It then calculates the minimum and maximum values for upvotes and downvotes based on these inputs. If the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, it prints '-', if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, it prints '+', otherwise it prints '?'.**
