Correctness: **True**

The program takes an input integer `n`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, it rounds `n` to the nearest integer that ends with zero. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it subtracts the remainder from `n` to get the rounded value. If the remainder is greater than 5, it adds the difference between 10 and the remainder to `n` to get the rounded value. This logic aligns with the problem description provided. Additionally, the program does not have any conditional branches that could lead to incorrect rounding, ensuring that it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
