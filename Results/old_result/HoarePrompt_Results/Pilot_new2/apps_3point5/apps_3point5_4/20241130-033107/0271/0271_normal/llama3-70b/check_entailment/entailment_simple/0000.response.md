Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It checks if the input integer `n` is divisible by 10, and if so, it prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it then checks if `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, and if true, it prints `n - n % 10`. Otherwise, it prints `n + (10 - n % 10)`, which ensures that the result is rounded to the nearest integer ending in 0, as required by the problem description.

Therefore, the program always produces the correct output for any given input according to the problem description.
