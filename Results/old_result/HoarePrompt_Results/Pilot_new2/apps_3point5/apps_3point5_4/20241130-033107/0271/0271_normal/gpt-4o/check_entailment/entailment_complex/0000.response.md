Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes a non-negative integer as input, calculates the remainder of the input divided by 10, and then determines the rounded number based on the remainder as described in the problem. It either subtracts the remainder from the input value or adds the difference between 10 and the remainder to the input value to get the rounded number. The program outputs the correct result for all cases based on the problem description.
