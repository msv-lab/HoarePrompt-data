Correctness: **False**

The code provided is incorrect because it does not adhere to the problem description for every potential case. The function `is_valid_number` does not handle cases where the substring `sub` is an empty string, which violates the requirement that `sub` can contain leading zeroes. Additionally, the function `generate_possible_numbers` references the missing function `is_valid_number`, which is crucial for determining the validity of candidate numbers.

Therefore, the code does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making it incorrect.
