Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing a very large integer that is not empty, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`, `n` is a string with the character `c` appended to the end. If the character `c` is in the set `t_set`, then `n` will have `c` appended at the end of it. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.***
