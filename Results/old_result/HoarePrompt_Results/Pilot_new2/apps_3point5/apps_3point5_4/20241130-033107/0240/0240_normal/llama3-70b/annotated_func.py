#State of the program right berfore the function call: s is a string representing a very large integer, and t is a substring of s.**
def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, `s`, `t`, `t_set`, and `n` will remain the same as their initial values.
    n += t
    return int(n)
    #The program returns the integer value of `n` after being increased by the initial value of `t`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `s` and `t`, where `s` is a string representing a very large integer, and `t` is a substring of `s`. The function iterates through each character in `s`, checks if it exists in the set of characters in `t`, and appends it to a new string `n`. Finally, it concatenates `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of the resulting string. The function essentially filters out characters from `s` that are also in `t` and returns the integer formed by those characters plus the initial `t`.
