Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t` that Vasya remembers. It then iterates through the characters in `s` and appends only those characters that are present in the set of characters of `t` to the variable `n`. Finally, it appends `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of `n`. This logic correctly follows the problem description as it constructs the smallest possible integer `n` based on the given substring `t`. The program handles the case where the substring contains leading zeros as well. Since the logic is correct and the program meets the requirements for all potential cases, the Correctness is True.
