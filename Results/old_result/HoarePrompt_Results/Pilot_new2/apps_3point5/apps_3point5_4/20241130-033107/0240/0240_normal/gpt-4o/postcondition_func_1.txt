The function `is_valid_number` accepts two string parameters `num_str` and `sub`. It returns True if the substring `sub` is found in the string `num_str` and the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`. If these conditions are not met, it returns False. The function does not account for cases where `n_len` is not defined, leading to potential errors. Additionally, it does not handle cases where `sub` is an empty string, which could potentially affect the validity check.
