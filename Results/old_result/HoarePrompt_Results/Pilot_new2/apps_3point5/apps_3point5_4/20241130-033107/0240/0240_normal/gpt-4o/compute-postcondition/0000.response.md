According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `chars` and `sub`. If the length of `chars` is at least 1 and `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the length of `chars` is not specified, so it needs to be adjusted to length of `chars` is at least 1 and `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`. Additionally, the values of `perm` will change in each iteration of the loop, so it should be adjusted to represent the first permutation of `chars`.
State: **chars is a string of digits with length at least 1, sub is a valid substring of chars, perm is the first permutation of chars**
