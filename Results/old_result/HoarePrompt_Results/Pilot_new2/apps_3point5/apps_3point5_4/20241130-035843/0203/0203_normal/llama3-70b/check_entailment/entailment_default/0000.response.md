Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the fact that the code simply counts the number of 'D' and 'R' fractions and declares the majority party as the winner. However, the description of the problem specifies a more complex voting procedure where employees can deny others the right to vote before making their own statement. This means that a simple count of fractions does not accurately predict the outcome of the vote in all scenarios. 

For example, in the case where 'DDRRR' is the input, the code will output 'D' based on the count of 'D' fractions. However, following the voting procedure described in the problem, the correct output should be 'R'. This shows that the code does not handle the voting process correctly and hence does not adhere to the problem description for all cases.
