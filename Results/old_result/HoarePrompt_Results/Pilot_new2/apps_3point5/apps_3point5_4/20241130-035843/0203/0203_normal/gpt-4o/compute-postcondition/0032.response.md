Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, characters in the input string are either 'D' or 'R', votes is the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and not empty, d_queue has the required number of elements, r_queue has the required number of elements, d_index is equal to the value popped from d_queue, r_index is adjusted (either popped from the beginning of r_queue or r_index + n depending on the condition), and both d_queue and r_queue have been updated accordingly for the loop to execute one more time. d_index has been appended to d_queue after adding n to it if the condition is true in the if part, otherwise r_queue contains the appended value of (r_index + n) in the else part.***
