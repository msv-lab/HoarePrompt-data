Correctness: **False**

The given code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. In the problem description, it is mentioned that each employee can deny the right to vote from others, and the process repeats until there is only one employee eligible to vote remaining. However, the code provided simply counts the number of 'D's and 'R's and then decides the outcome based on the count, without actually simulating the voting process.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not accurately predict the outcome of the vote based on the described procedure.
