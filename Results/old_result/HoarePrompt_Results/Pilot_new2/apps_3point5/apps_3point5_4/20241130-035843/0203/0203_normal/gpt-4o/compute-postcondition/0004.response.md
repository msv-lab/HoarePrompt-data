According to the code, the loop can execute only if the `votes` string is not empty. Additionally, the loop requires the index `i` and the vote `v` at that index. Therefore, before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees, characters in the input string are either 'D' or 'R', votes is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces and not empty, d_queue is an empty list, r_queue is an empty list, i is 0, v is the first character in the input string**
