In the if part, d_queue has one more element than before, r_queue has the same number of elements as before, d_index is the value that was removed from the front of d_queue, r_index is the value that was removed from the front of r_queue, and d_index is less than r_index. The newly added element in d_queue is equal to the previous d_index plus n. In the else part, d_queue has one less element than before, r_queue has one more element than before, and the new element in r_queue is equal to the previous r_index plus n.***
