Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It handles the case where k is greater than or equal to n by returning 'No'. It then iterates through the range [1, k] to calculate the remainder of n divided by i and checks if any remainder is repeated. If any remainder is repeated, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, if all remainders are distinct, it returns 'Yes'. The program covers all the requirements specified in the problem description and handles all potential cases.
