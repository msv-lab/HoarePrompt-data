Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers n and k as input and checks if all the remainders of n modulo i for i from 1 to k are distinct. It then prints "Yes" if all remainders are distinct, and "No" otherwise. The program correctly handles the case where k is greater than or equal to n by returning 'No' immediately. It then iterates through the range from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n modulo i, and checks if the remainder is already in the set of seen remainders. If it is, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set and continues. At the end, if no duplicate remainders are found, the program returns 'Yes'. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases.
