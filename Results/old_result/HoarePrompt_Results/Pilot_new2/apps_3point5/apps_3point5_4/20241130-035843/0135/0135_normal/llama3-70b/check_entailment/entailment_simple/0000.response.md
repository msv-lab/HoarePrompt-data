Correctness: **True**

The annotated program takes input integers `n` and `k`, and then iterates through all integers from 1 to `k` inclusive. For each integer `i`, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. If the remainder is already in the set `seen`, it prints "No" and exits. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set `seen`. After the loop is finished, if no remainders were repeated, it prints "Yes".

This program correctly follows the problem description by checking if all the remainders are distinct and printing "Yes" if they are, and "No" if they are not.
