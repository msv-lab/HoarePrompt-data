Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes two integers `n` and `k` as input and checks if all the remainders of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k` are distinct. It uses a set `seen` to keep track of the remainders seen so far. If a remainder is found in the set `seen`, it immediately prints 'No' and exits the program. If no repeated remainders are found, it prints 'Yes'. 

The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It ensures that all remainders are distinct and provides the output accordingly. The output hints also agree with the code and further confirm that it is correctly implemented. Hence, the code is correct for this problem.
