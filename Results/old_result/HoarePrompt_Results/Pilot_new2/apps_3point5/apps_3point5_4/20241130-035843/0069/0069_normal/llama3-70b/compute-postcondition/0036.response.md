The function `func` accepts no parameters. The function processes the string `s` of length `n` consisting of 0s and 1s, along with the integer `x` where -10^9 <= x <= 10^9. The function does not explicitly return any value, but it likely performs some operation or manipulation on the input parameters `s` and `x`.
