Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `s`, `balance`, `prefix_balances` list have at least one element. `results`, and `T` will be correctly updated based on the loop code. `balance` is not equal to 0. `count` is 0. The current values of `n`, `x`, `s`, `balance`, `prefix_balances` list, `results`, `T`, and `count` remain the same. Additionally, after entering the if condition, the value of `x - b` is divisible by `balance` and the result of the division is greater than or equal to 0.***
