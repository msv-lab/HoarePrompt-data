Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is assigned the integer value at index 8 of the list `data`, `s` is assigned the integer value at index 10 of the list `data`, `balance` is equal to the result of subtracting the count of '1's in `s` from the count of '0's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list where each element at index `i` is the sum of the differences between the counts of '0's and '1's in `s` up to index `i - 1` in `s`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is assigned the value 1. After the execution of the if else block, the overall state of the program variables remains consistent with the initial precondition, with the additional condition that `count` is updated to 1 if the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` are satisfied.***
