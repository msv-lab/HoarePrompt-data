Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case when the balance of '0's and '1's in the binary string `s` is equal to 0 and the desired balance `x` is in the cumulative sum list `prefix_balances`. The code appends -1 in this case but the correct output should be the number of prefixes with balance equal to `x` which is actually infinite in this scenario. Hence, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Additionally, the output hints correctly describe the functionality of the code and provide insights into the handling of different cases. The hints align with the code, confirming its approach to calculating the number of prefixes with a specific balance `x`. However, the discrepancy in handling the case where balance is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances` leads to incorrect results.
