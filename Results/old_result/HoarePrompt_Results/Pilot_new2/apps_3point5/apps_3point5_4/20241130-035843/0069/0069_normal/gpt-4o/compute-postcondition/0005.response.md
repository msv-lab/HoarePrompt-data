According to the code, the loop can only execute if T is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute:
State: **n is a positive integer, x is an integer in the range from -10^9 to 10^9, s is a binary string of length n, `input` is assigned the value `sys.stdin.read`, T is assigned the integer value at index 0 of the list `data` and must be greater than 0, index is 1, results is an empty list**
