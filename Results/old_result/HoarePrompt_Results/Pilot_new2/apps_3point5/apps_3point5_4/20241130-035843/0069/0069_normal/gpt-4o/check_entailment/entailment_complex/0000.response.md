Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input data correctly, calculates the balance of the binary string `s`, computes the cumulative sum list `prefix_balances`, and then determines the number of prefixes of `t` with balance equal to `x` based on the conditions provided in the problem description. It correctly handles cases where the balance is equal to 0 and when it is not. The logic inside the loop accurately counts the number of prefixes with the desired balance and appends the results accordingly. The program outputs the correct results for all test cases provided in the problem description.
