Postcondition: ***All variables are positive integers. `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. If `can_form` is False, `m` is incremented by 1, `assigned` contains the next element in the list `a`, and `i` is increased by 1. The loop has finished executing and the current value of `can_form` is still False.***
