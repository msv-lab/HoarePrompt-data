Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values, sorts them, and then iterates through the list to find the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. The logic of checking if each element in the sorted list is double the previous element ensures that the minimum number of variables is calculated accurately. Additionally, the program checks if the total number of variables exceeds the limit of 23 and returns -1 in that case as per the problem description. Overall, the program seems to be handling all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
