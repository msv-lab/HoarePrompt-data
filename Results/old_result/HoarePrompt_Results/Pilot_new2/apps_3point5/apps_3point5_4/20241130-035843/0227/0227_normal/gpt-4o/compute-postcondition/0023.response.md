Output State: **`n`, `x`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i` are all positive integers. `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. `assigned` contains all elements of `a` up to index `i`. If `can_form` is True, the loop executes without any change in the state of the program variables. If `can_form` is False, the loop executes with `m` set to 2 and `i` set to 1, checking if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned` after each iteration. After executing the code, `assigned` will have the element `a[i]` added to it.**
