Postcondition: ***`n`, `x`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i` are all positive integers. `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. `assigned` contains a[0], `m` is 1, `i` is 1. The loop executes when n is greater than or equal to 2. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, the loop breaks, otherwise, it completes all iterations without any change in the state of the program variables. `can_form` is False***
