Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly determines the minimum number of variables needed to perform the described sequence of operations. It uses a sorting approach to check if each element in the sequence can be derived from the previous element by doubling it. If the condition is not met, it increments the variable count. The program handles the given constraints and correctly outputs the minimum number of variables needed or -1 if the sequence cannot be performed.
