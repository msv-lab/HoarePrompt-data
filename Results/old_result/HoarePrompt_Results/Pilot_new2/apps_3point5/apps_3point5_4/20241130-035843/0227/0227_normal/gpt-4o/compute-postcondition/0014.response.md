Postcondition: ***`n`, `x` is the next element in `assigned`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i` are all positive integers. `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `can_form` is True. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then break out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, no change in the state of the program variables.***
