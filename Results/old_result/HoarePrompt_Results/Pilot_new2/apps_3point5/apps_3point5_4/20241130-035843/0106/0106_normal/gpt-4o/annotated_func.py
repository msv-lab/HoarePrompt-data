    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b` are assigned the location of apartment `a` and `b` in the building. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. If `floor_a` is not equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is equal to 10 + (`floor_a` - 1).

    #The program returns the total time calculated based on the given conditions, which includes time to exit, minimum walk time, and time to the target floor.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where all are integers satisfying specific constraints. It calculates and returns the total time required based on the given conditions, which include the time to exit the building, the minimum walk time between two locations, and the time to reach the target floor. The function accurately computes the total time based on the provided inputs.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: apartment is an integer representing the apartment number where Edward or Natasha live.**
def get_location(apartment):
    block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)
    floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
    return block, floor
    #The program returns the `block` and `floor` where `block` is the result of the expression `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` and `floor` is the result of the expression `floor_within_block // k + 1`
#Overall this is what the function does:Functionality: The `get_location` function accepts an integer parameter `apartment`, representing the apartment number where Edward or Natasha live. It then calculates and returns the `block` and `floor` where the apartment is located. The `block` is determined by the expression `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, and the `floor` is calculated using the expression `floor_within_block // k + 1`. The function successfully calculates the location based on the input apartment number. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases in the provided code.
