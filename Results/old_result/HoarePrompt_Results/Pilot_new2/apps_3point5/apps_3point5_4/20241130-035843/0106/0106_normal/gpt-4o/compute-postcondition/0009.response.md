Output State: **If `floor_a` is equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. If `floor_a` is not equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is equal to 10 + (`floor_a` - 1). `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`, divided by `n` and multiplied by 15. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15. `min_walk_time` is the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`.**
