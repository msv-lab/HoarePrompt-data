Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer parameter `n` in the range 0 to 99 and returns a string representation of that number based on specific cases as described in the problem.
- It handles cases where `n` is between 0 and 9, between 11 and 19, between 10 and 99 and divisible by 10, and between 10 and 99 but does not fall into the previous categories.
- The code uses lists of English numerals to construct the textual representation of the numbers.
- The output hints also accurately describe the conditions and cases handled by the code, confirming that the function works as expected for all potential cases.
