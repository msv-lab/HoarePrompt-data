Correctness: **True**

The program takes an integer input `s` and converts it to its string representation based on the rules provided in the problem description. It correctly handles all cases including numbers from 0 to 99 and outputs the corresponding text representation. The program uses lists to store the string representations of numbers for easier lookup and concatenates the strings as needed.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and produces the expected output for all possible input values.
