The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is an integer such that 0 <= k <= 8. After executing the function body, the program returns the positive integer `n` which was initially assigned to variable `x`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and an integer `k` within the range of 0 to 8, and return the value of `n`. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a positive integer n and an integer k within the range of 0 to 8, and returns the positive integer n assigned to variable x.**
