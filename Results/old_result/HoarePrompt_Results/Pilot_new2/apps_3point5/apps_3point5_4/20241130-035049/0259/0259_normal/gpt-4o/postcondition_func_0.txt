The function accepts three parameters: n, t, and bus_routes. It iterates through the bus_routes to calculate the minimum wait time for each route based on the arrival time and interval. Then, it returns the route number with the minimum wait time among all routes. If there are multiple routes with the same minimum wait time, it returns the route that appears first in the list.
