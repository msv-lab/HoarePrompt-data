Postcondition: ***All variables `n, t, bus_routes, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i+1, s_(i+1), d_(i+1)` are positive integers. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then after execution `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is assigned the value 0. If `(t - s_i) % d_i != 0`, then `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of the `i`-th tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of the `i`-th tuple in `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
