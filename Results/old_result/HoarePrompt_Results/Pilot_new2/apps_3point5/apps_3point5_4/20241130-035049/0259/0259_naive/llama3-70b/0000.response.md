Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, calculates the time difference between the arrival time of the buses and the time Serval goes to the station, and then finds the bus route that has the minimum time difference. The program handles all the bus routes and accurately determines the bus route that Serval will use. Additionally, the output is the index of the bus route starting from 1, which is in line with the problem description. Overall, the program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description and works correctly for all cases.
