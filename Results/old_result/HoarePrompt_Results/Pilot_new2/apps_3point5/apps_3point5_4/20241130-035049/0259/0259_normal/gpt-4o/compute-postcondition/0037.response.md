Output State: **All variables `n, t, bus_routes, min_wait_time, chosen_route, i, s_i, d_i` are positive integers. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`. If `s_i` is less than `t` and `(t - s_i) % d_i` is 0, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. After all iterations, `min_wait_time` will be the minimum wait time among all routes, and `chosen_route` will be the route with the minimum wait time.**
