# Initial assessment:
The program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `func_2`. `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of positive integers, and `func_2` finds all the divisors of a perfect square in descending order. The main program takes input values for N, K, and the list of integers A, calculates the sum of A, finds the GCD of A, and then iterates through the divisors of the sum to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after performing operations.

# Checking with Output Hints:
- The output description for `func_1` is clear and matches the code. The function computes the GCD of the elements in the list as described.
- The output description for `func_2` is also clear and matches the code. The function correctly identifies the divisors of a perfect square.
- The main program checks all divisors of the sum to find the maximum positive integer that satisfies the conditions based on the problem description.

# Final assessment:
The code seems to follow the problem description accurately. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` perform their respective tasks correctly, and the main program successfully finds the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.

Correctness: **True**.
