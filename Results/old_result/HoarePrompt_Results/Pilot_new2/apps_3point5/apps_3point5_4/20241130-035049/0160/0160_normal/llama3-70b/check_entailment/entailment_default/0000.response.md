Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input as described in the problem statement.
- It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in the list A correctly.
- Then it finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to the square root of gcd, which is a valid approach to solving the problem.
- Finally, it prints the maximum divisor, which is the expected output based on the problem description.
- The code seems to cover all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
- The output hints also agree with the code and confirm that it is handling the calculation of the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
