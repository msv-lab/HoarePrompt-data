Correctness: **True**

The annotated program consists of two functions. 

Function 1 (func_1) correctly computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of a list of numbers. This is used to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. This function is in line with the problem description and provides the necessary functionality.

Function 2 (func_2) correctly finds all the divisors of a perfect square number x and returns them in sorted order in descending order. This is crucial for determining the factors that will divide every element of A after operations. This function also aligns with the requirements of the problem description.

Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description by correctly computing the greatest common divisor of the elements in A and finding the divisors of a perfect square number, which are essential steps in solving the problem.
