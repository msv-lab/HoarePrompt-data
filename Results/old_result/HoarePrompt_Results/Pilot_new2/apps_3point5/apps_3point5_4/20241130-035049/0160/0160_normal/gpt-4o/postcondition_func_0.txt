The function `func_1` accepts a list of positive integers `lst`, where the first element of the list is considered as the initial greatest common divisor. It then iterates through the remaining elements of the list, updating the greatest common divisor accordingly. The function returns the final greatest common divisor calculated from all positive integers in the list `lst`. The function assumes `lst` contains at least two positive integers, and the values in the list are valid positive integers between 1 and 10^6.
