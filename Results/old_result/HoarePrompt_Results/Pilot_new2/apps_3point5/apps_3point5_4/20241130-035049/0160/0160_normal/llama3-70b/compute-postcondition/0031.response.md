Functionality: ** The function `func` reads two integers N and K from input, then reads a list of N positive integers A. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A and finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to the square root of gcd. Finally, it prints the maximum divisor. The function operates under the constraints that N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9, and A_i values are positive integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i.**
