Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It considers all possible divisors of the sum of the elements in A and checks if each divisor satisfies the condition that it divides every element of A after the operations. The program uses the math module to calculate the greatest common divisor (gcd) and to find all divisors of a number, ensuring accurate calculations. Additionally, it iterates through all divisors in descending order to find the maximum possible positive integer that meets the criteria. The program handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for the given input.
