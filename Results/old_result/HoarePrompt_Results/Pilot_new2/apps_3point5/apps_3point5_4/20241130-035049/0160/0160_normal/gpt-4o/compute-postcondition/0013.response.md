Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all 1 <= i <= N, x is a perfect square. If x is divisible by i, divisors will be updated to include x divided by i for each i in divisors, i is incremented by 1. After running the code, `divisors.add(x // i)`, the set divisors is updated to include the value of x divided by the new value of i, where i is an integer.***
