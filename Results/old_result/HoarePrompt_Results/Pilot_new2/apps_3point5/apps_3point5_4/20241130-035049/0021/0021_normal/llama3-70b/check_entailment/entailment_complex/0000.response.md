Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly follows the problem description. It reads an integer n and a list of n integers, finds the positions of 1 and n in the list, calculates the maximum possible distance between these positions excluding the endpoints, and prints this maximum distance. The calculation of the maximum distance is done correctly by considering the absolute difference between the positions of 1 and n, subtracting 1, and then ensuring that the endpoints are not included in the calculation.

The program handles all potential cases as it accurately determines the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap. It considers scenarios where the minimum and maximum elements are already in their optimal positions and adjusts the distance calculation accordingly.

Overall, the program aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for the given task.
