Correctness: **True**

The program accurately follows the problem description. It reads the input integers and calculates the maximum distance between the indices of 0 and `n-1` in the list `a`. By finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements and calculating the distances from the ends of the array, it determines the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap. The output of the program matches the expected output as per the problem description for all test cases.
