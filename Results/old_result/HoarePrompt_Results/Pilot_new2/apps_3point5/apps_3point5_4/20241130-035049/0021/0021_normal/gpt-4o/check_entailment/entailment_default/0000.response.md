Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads an integer `n` followed by a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the indices of 0 and `n-1` in the list `a` by finding the positions of the minimum element `1` and the maximum element `n`. The code then calculates the distances between these elements and the ends of the array, and outputs the maximum distance achieved.

The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It ensures that the minimum and maximum elements are as far apart as possible by finding their positions and calculating the maximum distance. The provided examples also match the expected outputs based on the problem description. Thus, the code is correct.
