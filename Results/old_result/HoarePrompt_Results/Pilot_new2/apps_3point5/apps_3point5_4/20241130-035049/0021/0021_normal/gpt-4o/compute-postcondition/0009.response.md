Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n integers obtained from the input, `min_pos` is the index of the element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the element n in list `a`, `dist1` is equal to the absolute difference between 0 and the index of the element n in list `a`, `dist2` is equal to the absolute difference between n - 1 and the index of the element n in list `a`, `dist3` is equal to the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, `dist4` is equal to the absolute difference between n - 1 and `min_pos`, and `max_distance` is the maximum value among dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4. `max_distance` is printed.**
