Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements Nicholas can achieve by performing exactly one swap. It first finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n). Then, it calculates the maximum and minimum distances between these elements if only one swap is allowed. Finally, it prints the maximum of these distances, which gives the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after the swap.

The program follows the problem description as it correctly implements the logic to maximize the distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap. It covers all potential cases and returns the correct output.
