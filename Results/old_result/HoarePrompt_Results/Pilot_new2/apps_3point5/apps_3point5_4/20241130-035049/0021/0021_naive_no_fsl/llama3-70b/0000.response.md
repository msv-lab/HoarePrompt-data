Correctness: True

The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the position of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array, then calculates the maximum possible distance by considering the positions and the array size. It covers all potential cases and correctly determines the maximum distance after a single swap. The logic of the program is sound and there are no edge cases where it fails to meet the requirements stated in the problem description.
