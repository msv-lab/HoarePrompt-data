Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing the values entered as input and separated by spaces. `a` is the string '0' with leading zeros removed. `b` is the string '0' with leading zeros removed. After not entering the if condition, the length of `a` is not less than the length of `b`. Additionally, the current value of `b` does not result in a True evaluation when used in the `not` operation.***
