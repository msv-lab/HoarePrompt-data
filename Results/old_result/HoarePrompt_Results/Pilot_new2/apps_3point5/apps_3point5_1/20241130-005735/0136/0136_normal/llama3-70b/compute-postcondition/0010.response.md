Postcondition: ***a, b are non-negative integers with no leading zeroes. If a is equal to b, then both a and b have the same value. If a is not equal to b, then the program outputs '<' if a < b, indicating that a is less than b. If a >= b, the program continues with a being greater than or equal to b.***
