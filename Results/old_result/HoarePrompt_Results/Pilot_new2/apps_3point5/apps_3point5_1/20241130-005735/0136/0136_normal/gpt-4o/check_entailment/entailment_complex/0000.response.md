The annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads two very long integers as input, removes leading zeros, compares the lengths of the integers, and then compares the values if the lengths are equal. The program outputs the correct symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison of the integers as specified in the problem description. The program handles all cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output.
