Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in Udayland as described in the problem description.
2. The functions `func_1` and `func_2` handle the input constraints and edge cases mentioned in the annotations.
3. The code utilizes modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prints the output as `(A % MOD, B % MOD)` as required.
4. The provided annotations agree with the actual code and do not describe any cases that are not valid or do not align with the problem description.
5. The examples given in the problem description are correctly calculated by the code, demonstrating its correctness.
