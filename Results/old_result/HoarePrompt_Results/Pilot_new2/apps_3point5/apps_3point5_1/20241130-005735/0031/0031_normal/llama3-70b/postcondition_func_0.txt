The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The function calculates the remainder of the division of two numbers, numerator and denominator, based on the provided inputs. It then returns the remainder of the numerator divided by (10^6 + 3) and the remainder of the denominator divided by (10^6 + 3).
