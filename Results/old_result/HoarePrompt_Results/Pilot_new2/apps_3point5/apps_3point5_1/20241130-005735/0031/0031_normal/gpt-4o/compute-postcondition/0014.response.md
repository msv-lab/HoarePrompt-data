According to the code, the loop can execute up to `k` times depending on the variable `i`. At the end of the last iteration, the following states were observed:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `k` is at least 2, `total_days` is equal to 2^n, `numerator` is updated as `numerator` multiplied by (`total_days` - `i`) modulo `MOD`, `denominator` is updated as `denominator` multiplied by `total_days` modulo `MOD`, `i` is increased by 1**

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1:
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `k` is at least 2, `total_days` is equal to 2^n, `numerator` is updated as `numerator` multiplied by (`total_days` - `i + 1`) modulo `MOD`, `denominator` is updated as `denominator` multiplied by `total_days` modulo `MOD`, `i` is increased by 1**
