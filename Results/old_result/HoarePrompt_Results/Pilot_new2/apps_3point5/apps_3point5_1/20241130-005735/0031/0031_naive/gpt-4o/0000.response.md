Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland given the values of n and k. It follows the problem description by calculating the probability using the provided formula and taking care of edge cases such as when k is greater than 2^n. The program accounts for the possibility of large numbers by using modulo arithmetic. The implementation of the functions func_1 and func_2 also aligns with the problem requirements. Overall, the program seems to fulfill the problem description for all potential cases.
