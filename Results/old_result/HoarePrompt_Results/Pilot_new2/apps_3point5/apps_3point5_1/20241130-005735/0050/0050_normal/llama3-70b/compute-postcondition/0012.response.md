Postcondition: ***n, m, r are positive integers between 1 and 30, s_i, b_i are positive integers between 1 and 1000, s is a list of integers in ascending order, b is a list of integers in descending order. If r >= s[i], shares is updated based on the calculation shares += r // s[i] and r is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i]. Otherwise, r is less than s[i] and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
