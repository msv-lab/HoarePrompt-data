Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `i` must be updated based on the logic of the program to continue the loop execution. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is incremented by the floor division of `r` divided by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the floor division of `r` divided by `s[i]`. Otherwise, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `i` are updated to continue the loop execution and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
