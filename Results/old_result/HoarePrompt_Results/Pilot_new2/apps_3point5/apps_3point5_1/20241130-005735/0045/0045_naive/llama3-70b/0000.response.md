Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program takes two integers n and k as input. It then creates a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers where their sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor is maximal. The program iterates from 1 to k, adding the numbers to the sequence as long as n allows for it, and then checks if the length of the sequence is equal to k. 

The program correctly handles cases where no such sequence is possible (n < k) and outputs -1. For cases where a valid sequence exists, it generates the sequence as required.

After reviewing the code and considering all possible scenarios, it can be concluded that the program follows the problem description and outputs the correct results for all cases.
