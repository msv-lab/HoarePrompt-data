Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input. It then generates a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers whose sum is equal to `n` and the greatest common divisor is maximal. If such a sequence exists, it outputs the sequence; otherwise, it outputs -1.

The code iterates from 1 to `k` and checks if `n` is greater than or equal to the current number. If it is, the number is added to the sequence and `n` is decremented by that number. If at any point the sequence cannot be completed (i.e., `n` becomes less than the current number being considered), the code breaks out and outputs -1.

The code seems to be correctly following the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints also align with the code's functionality. Therefore, the code is correct.
