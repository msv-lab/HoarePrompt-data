Correctness: **True**

The program calculates a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers that sum up to n and have the maximum greatest common divisor. It first checks if it's possible to have a sequence with the given n and k values, and returns -1 if not. 

If a valid sequence can be generated, the program calculates the values in the sequence based on the given formula and ensures that the sequence is strictly increasing. The program also handles cases where there might be multiple valid sequences by breaking out of the loop when the remainder becomes 0.

Overall, the program correctly follows the problem description and generates the required sequence according to the defined conditions.
