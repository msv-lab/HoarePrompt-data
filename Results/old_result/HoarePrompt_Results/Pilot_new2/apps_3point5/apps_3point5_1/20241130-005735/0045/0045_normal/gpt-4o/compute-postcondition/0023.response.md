Output State: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to k*(k + 1) // 2, calculated `min_sum` is less than or equal to n, `d` is equal to n divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is equal to n - `d` * `min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing values calculated as `d` * (i + 1) for i in range(k), `i` is -1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, then the program breaks out of the loop.
