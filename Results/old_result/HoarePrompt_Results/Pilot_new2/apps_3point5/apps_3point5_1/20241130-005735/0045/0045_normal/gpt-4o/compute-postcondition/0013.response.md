According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` starts at k - 1 and decrements down to 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` must be equal to -1.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is equal to k*(k + 1) // 2, calculated `min_sum` is less than or equal to n, d is equal to n divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is equal to n - d * `min_sum` - 1, `sequence` is a list containing values calculated as d * (i + 1) + 1 for i in range(k), `i` is -1**
