Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program calculates the minimum sum of the sequence using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2 and checks if it is greater than n. If it is greater, then it returns -1 which is in accordance with the problem description.
2. It then calculates the common divisor d and the remainder to distribute among the elements of the sequence.
3. It then creates the sequence of k numbers with the maximum possible greatest common divisor.
4. If there is a remainder left, it adds 1 to the elements of the sequence starting from the end to distribute the remainder.
5. The program outputs the resulting sequence if it exists, otherwise -1.

The program covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides a valid sequence with the maximum possible greatest common divisor for the given input.
