Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program calculates the minimum possible sum of the sequence using the formula k * (k + 1) / 2 where k is the number of elements in the sequence.
2. It then checks if the minimum sum is greater than the given number n. If it is, then it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
3. It computes the divisor d by dividing n by the minimum sum.
4. It calculates the remainder after subtracting d * minimum sum from n.
5. It creates a sequence of k elements where each element is d multiplied by (i + 1) for i in range(k).
6. It then adjusts the sequence by adding 1 to some elements in order to account for the remainder, ensuring that the sum of the sequence is equal to n.
7. Finally, it returns the resulting sequence.
8. The program correctly handles the case where there is no possible sequence (when min_sum > n) and outputs -1 in that case.
