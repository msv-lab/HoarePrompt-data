Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The annotated program provided does not actually perform the operations required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length x into an equilateral triangle of side length y. Instead, it simply calculates the absolute difference between the two side lengths x and y. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and does not provide the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y starting with the equilateral triangle of side length x.
