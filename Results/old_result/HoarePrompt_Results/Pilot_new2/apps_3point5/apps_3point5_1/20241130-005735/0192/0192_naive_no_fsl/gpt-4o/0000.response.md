Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It then calculates and prints the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x.

The program calculates this by taking the absolute difference between x and y, dividing it by 2, and then adding the remainder of the division by 2. This logic is correct and follows the problem description accurately. 

For all the provided examples, the program produces the correct output based on the given problem description. Additionally, the program accounts for the requirement that the length of each side should be an integer.
