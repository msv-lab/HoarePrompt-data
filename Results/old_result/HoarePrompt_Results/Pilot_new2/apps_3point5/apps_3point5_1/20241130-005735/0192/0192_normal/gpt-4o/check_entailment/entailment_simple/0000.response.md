Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the starting equilateral triangle of side length x. This is achieved by finding the absolute difference between x and y, dividing it by 2 and adding the remainder if the difference is odd.

The program follows the problem description as it ensures that at any moment of time, the length of each side of the triangle is an integer and the triangle remains non-degenerate. The program correctly handles all possible cases and provides the expected output.
