Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It reads three integers x, y, and z as input and determines the result based on the conditions specified in the problem. It checks whether x is greater than y + z, less than y, equal to y with z equal to 0, or equal to y with z not equal to 0, and prints the corresponding symbol. If none of these conditions are met, it prints '?' to indicate uncertainty.

The program covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each scenario. Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description accurately.
