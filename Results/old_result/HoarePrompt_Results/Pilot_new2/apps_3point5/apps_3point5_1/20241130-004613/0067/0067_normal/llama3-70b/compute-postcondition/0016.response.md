Postcondition: ***x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. x is less than or equal to y + z. If x is less than y, then x remains unchanged. If x equals y and z is 0, then z remains unchanged. If x equals y and z is not 0, then z is updated. If x is not equal to y, then x, y, and z remain unchanged.***
