Functionality: ** The function reads input as three non-negative integers x, y, and z within the range of 0 to 100. It then compares these values and prints specific symbols based on the conditions. If x is greater than y + z, it prints '+'. If x is less than y, it prints '-'. If x equals y, it further checks if z is 0 and prints '0' in that case, otherwise it prints '?'. If x is not equal to y, it also prints '?'. The function does not take any parameters and does not return any value. **
