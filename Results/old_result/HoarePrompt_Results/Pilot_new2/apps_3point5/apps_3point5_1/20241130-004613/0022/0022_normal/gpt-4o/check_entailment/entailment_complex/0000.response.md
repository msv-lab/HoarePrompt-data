Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input. It then iterates through the string checking if the characters at symmetric positions are the same. If all characters at symmetric positions match from the start to the middle of the string, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False.

This aligns perfectly with the problem description of checking if the given string is "s-palindrome". The program correctly determines if the string `s` is an "s-palindrome" as described in the problem. Therefore, the program is correct in meeting the requirements of the problem description.
