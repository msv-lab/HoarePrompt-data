Postcondition: ***s is a string containing only English letters with a length of at least 2, n is the length of string s, i is 1 and goes up to (n // 2) - 1. The characters at positions i and n - 1 - i in string s are the same for all i from 0 to (n // 2) - 1. If s[i] != s[n - 1 - i], the program returns False. Otherwise, the program does not execute anything.***
