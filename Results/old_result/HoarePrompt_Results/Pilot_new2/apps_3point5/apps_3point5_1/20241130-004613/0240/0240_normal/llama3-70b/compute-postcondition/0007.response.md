Output State: **`s`, `t`, `n` are strings and `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of `t`. If the next character in `s` is `c`, then the current value of `c` is in `t_set` and `n` is the concatenation of the previous value of `n` and `c`. `n` is the concatenation of the previous value of `n` and `c`.**
