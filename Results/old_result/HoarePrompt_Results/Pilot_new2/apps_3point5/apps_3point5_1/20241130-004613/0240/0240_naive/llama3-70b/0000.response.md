Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly follows the problem description. It reconstructs the smallest integer `n` by iterating through the input string `s` and only appending the characters that are present in the remembered substring `t`. The final output is the smallest integer `n` that Vasya could have passed to Kate. The program works as expected for all potential cases and the output matches the requirements of the problem description.
