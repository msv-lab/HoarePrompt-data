You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya decided to pass a very large integer n to Kate. First, he wrote that number as a string, then he appended to the right integer k — the number of digits in n. 

Magically, all the numbers were shuffled in arbitrary order while this note was passed to Kate. The only thing that Vasya remembers, is a non-empty substring of n (a substring of n is a sequence of consecutive digits of the number n).

Vasya knows that there may be more than one way to restore the number n. Your task is to find the smallest possible initial integer n. Note that decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except the case the integer n was equal to zero itself (in this case a single digit 0 was used).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the string received by Kate. The number of digits in this string does not exceed 1 000 000.

The second line contains the substring of n which Vasya remembers. This string can contain leading zeroes. 

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct, and the answer always exists.


-----Output-----

Print the smalles integer n which Vasya could pass to Kate.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: s and sub are strings.**
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `s` and `sub` are strings, `n_len` is the length of `s` minus the length of `sub`, `s_counter` is a counter object that stores the frequency of characters in string `s`, `sub_counter` is a counter object that stores the frequency of characters in string `sub`, all characters in `sub_counter` have been subtracted from `s_counter`
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    return smallest_number
    #The program returns the smallest number in `possible_numbers` which is generated based on `remaining_chars` and `sub`
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two string parameters `s` and `sub`. It calculates the difference in character frequencies between `s` and `sub`, then generates possible numbers based on the remaining characters in `s` after subtracting the characters in `sub`. Finally, it returns the smallest number from the generated possible numbers.

#Function 2:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: num_str is a string representing a positive integer with up to 1,000,000 digits, sub is a string representing a non-empty substring of num_str.
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #The program returns True if the string represented by 'sub' is a substring of 'num_str' and the length of 'num_str' is equal to 'n_len'. Otherwise, it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two strings `num_str` and `sub`, and returns True if `sub` is a substring of `num_str` and the length of `num_str` is equal to a variable `n_len`. Otherwise, it returns False. It may not handle cases where the length of `num_str` does not match `n_len` or when `sub` is not a substring of `num_str`.

#Function 3:
#State of the program right berfore the function call: chars is a string representing a very large integer, and sub is a substring of chars.**
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, all possible permutations of `chars` have been iterated over, and the valid numbers as candidates have been yielded.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes in two parameters, `chars` and `sub`, where `chars` is a string representing a very large integer, and `sub` is a substring of `chars`. The function iterates over all possible permutations of `chars` and yields candidates that are valid numbers based on the `is_valid_number` function. The function does not return any specific output but yields valid candidate numbers.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
