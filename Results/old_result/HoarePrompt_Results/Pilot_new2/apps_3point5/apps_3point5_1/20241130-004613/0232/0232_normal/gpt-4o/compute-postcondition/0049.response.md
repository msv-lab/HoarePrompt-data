According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the comparison of `current_counts` with `desired_counts` for all colors. If the count of any color in `current_counts` is not equal to the desired count in `desired_counts`, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, all colors in `current_counts` are not equal to the desired count in `desired_counts`, so the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted. 

State: **Output State: All colors in `current_counts` are not equal to the desired count in `desired_counts`, program does not return 'YES', `left` is increased by the total number of times the loop executed + 2, `right` is incremented by 1, the count of color `colors[right]` in `current_counts` is increased by 1, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1**
