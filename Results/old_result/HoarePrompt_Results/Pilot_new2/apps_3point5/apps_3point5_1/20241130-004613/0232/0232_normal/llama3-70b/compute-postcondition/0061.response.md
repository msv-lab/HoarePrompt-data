Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n+1, `colors` is a list of integers with at least n+1 colors, `color` is the last color in the list, `counts` is the list of integers, `color_counts` has updated values with the number of occurrences of each color, `found` is True, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the color not in it has a count of 0, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is equal to `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
