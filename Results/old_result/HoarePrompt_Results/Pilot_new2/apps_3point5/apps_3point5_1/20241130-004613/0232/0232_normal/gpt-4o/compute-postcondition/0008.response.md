Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers; k is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, such that 1 ≤ sum(k) ≤ n; desired_counts is a dictionary mapping each color to its desired count based on the values in list k; current_counts for at least one color is not equal to the desired count after the increment; left is 0, right goes from 0 to n-1***
