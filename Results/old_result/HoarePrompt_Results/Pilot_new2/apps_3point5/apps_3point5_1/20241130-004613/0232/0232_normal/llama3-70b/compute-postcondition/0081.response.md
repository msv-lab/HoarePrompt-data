Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n+1, `colors` is a list of integers with at least n+1 colors, `color` is the last color in the list, `counts` is the list of integers, `color_counts` has updated values with the number of occurrences of each color, `found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the targets in `counts`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where each color in `colors` has a count equal to its occurrences in the list, `i` is less than n, `j` is equal to `n-1`, `color` is equal to `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by the number of occurrences of `color` in the list. Additionally, `found` is True and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
