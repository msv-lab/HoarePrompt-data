The function `func_1` takes in parameters `n` (a positive integer), `m` (a positive integer such that 1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` (a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers), and `k` (a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, where 1 ≤ sum(k) ≤ n). It then calculates the current counts of lightsabers of each color and compares them to the desired counts. Based on this, it returns 'YES' or 'NO' under different conditions. The function handles different cases to determine when to return 'YES' and when to return 'NO', accounting for various scenarios of matches and mismatches between the current and desired counts.
