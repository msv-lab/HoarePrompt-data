Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `colors`, `color`, `counts`, `color_counts`, `found`, `i`, and `j` are incremented by 1, `window_counts` is a dictionary with the key `color` and value `1`, `i` is less than `n`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and the `color` is not in `window_counts`. If all the counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
