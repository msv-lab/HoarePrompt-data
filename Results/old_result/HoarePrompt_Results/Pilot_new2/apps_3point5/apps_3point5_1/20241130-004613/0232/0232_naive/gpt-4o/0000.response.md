Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists an interval where the desired counts of lightsabers of each color can be achieved. It iterates through the list of Jedi Knights, updating the counts of each color and checking if the desired counts are met. The program handles all potential cases by using a sliding window approach and checking if the counts match the desired counts.
