Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to correctly follow the problem description. The function `func_1` takes in the parameters `n` (number of Jedi Knights), `m` (number of possible colors of lightsabers), `colors` (colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights), and `k` (desired counts of lightsabers of each color). The function then calculates the current counts of lightsabers of each color and compares them to the desired counts. It returns 'YES' if there exists an interval with the prescribed color counts, and 'NO' if there is none.

The output hints also align with the code, explaining the functionality of the `func_1` function in terms of comparing current counts to desired counts and returning the appropriate result. The code seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
