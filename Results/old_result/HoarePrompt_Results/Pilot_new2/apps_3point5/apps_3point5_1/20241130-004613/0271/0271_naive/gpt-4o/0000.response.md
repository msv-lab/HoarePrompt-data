Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the result of rounding the input number n to the nearest integer that ends with 0. It calculates the remainder when n is divided by 10, then based on the remainder, it either subtracts the remainder from n or adds the difference between 10 and the remainder to n to get the rounded number. This logic covers all possible cases as mentioned in the problem description, and for every input within the provided constraints, the program produces the correct output.
