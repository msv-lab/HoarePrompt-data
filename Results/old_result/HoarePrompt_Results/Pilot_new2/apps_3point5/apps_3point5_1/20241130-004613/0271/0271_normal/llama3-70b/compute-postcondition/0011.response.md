Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer input `n` from the user. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints the value of `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it adjusts the value based on the remainder of `n % 10`. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it prints `n - n % 10`. If the remainder is greater than 5, it prints `n + (10 - n % 10)`. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
