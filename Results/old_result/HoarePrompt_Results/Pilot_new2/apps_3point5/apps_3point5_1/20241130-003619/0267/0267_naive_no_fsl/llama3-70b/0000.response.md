Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly defines a function `count` to calculate the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits within a given range.
2. The main function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that satisfy the condition of at most `k` different digits by calling the `count` function.
3. The final result is calculated modulo `998244353` as required.
4. The program uses dynamic programming and memoization to optimize the calculation of counts, ensuring efficiency in handling large inputs.
5. The program logic aligns with the problem description and the provided examples, ensuring correctness for all potential cases within the given constraints.
