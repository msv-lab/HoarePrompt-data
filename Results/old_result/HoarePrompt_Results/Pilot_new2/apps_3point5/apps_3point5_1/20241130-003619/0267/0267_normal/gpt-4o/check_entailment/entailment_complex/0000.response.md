Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The `func_1` function only checks if the number of unique digits in a given integer is less than or equal to the specified limit `k`. However, the problem description requires the code to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. The code lacks the logic to generate numbers that contain at most `k` different digits.

Therefore, the code provided is incorrect as it does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.
