The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. It calculates the result of (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD, where l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and dp is an empty dictionary. The function does not define the `count` function or the value of `MOD`, so its actual functionality is dependent on the implementation of these missing components.
