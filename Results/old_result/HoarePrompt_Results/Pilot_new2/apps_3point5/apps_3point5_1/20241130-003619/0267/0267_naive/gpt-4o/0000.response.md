Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. It uses two functions `func_1` to check if a number has at most $k$ different digits and `func_2` to calculate the total sum. The logic in both functions seems to be correct and there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that are not handled by the program. Thus, the program is correct for all potential cases.
