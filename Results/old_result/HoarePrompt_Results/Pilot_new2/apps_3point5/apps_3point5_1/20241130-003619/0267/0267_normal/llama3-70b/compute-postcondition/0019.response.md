Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary. If n < 10^k, then `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary with the key (n, k) having the value of n where n is less than 10 and (n, k) is not in dp. Otherwise, if n is greater than or equal to 10^k, then `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary, `k` is not equal to 0, (`n`, `k`) is not in `dp`, `n` is greater than or equal to 10^k, `dp[n, k]` is equal to 9 * 10^(k-1) * (10^1 - 10^(k-1)) + 9 + (10^2 mod MOD), `i` is `k`.***
