The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. It returns True if the number of unique digits in the integer 'n' is less than or equal to the integer 'k'. If the number of unique digits in 'n' exceeds 'k', the function returns False. The code accurately checks if the number of unique digits in 'n' is less than or equal to 'k' and returns True in that case. However, it lacks handling cases where 'n' has more unique digits than 'k', which should result in returning False.
