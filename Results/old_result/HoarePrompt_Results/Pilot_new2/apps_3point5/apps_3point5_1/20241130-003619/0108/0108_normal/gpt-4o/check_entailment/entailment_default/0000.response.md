Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and iterates through the string `s` and the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' simultaneously, trying to match characters. If it successfully matches all characters in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' with `s`, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Otherwise, it prints -1. The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem description for every potential case. Since the code follows the problem description and all the examples provided in the description seem to work correctly, the correctness of the code is True.
