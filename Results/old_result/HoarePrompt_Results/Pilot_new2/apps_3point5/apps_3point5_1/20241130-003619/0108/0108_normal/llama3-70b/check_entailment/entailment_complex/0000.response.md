Correctness: **True**

The program reads a string input and iterates over the alphabet 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. For each character in the alphabet, it replaces that character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet until all characters in the alphabet have been processed. Then, it constructs a result string containing all characters from the alphabet that were present in the input string before any replacements occurred. If the length of this result string is 26, it prints the result string. Otherwise, it prints -1.

This implementation follows the problem description accurately. It ensures that the final string obtained contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. The logic is correct, and for every possible case, the program will provide the correct output as per the problem requirements.
