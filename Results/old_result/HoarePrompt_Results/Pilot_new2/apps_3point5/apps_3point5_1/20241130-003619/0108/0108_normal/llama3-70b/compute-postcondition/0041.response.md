Postcondition: ***`s` is the final string after all replacements have been made, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` contains all characters from `alphabet` that were present in `s` before any replacements occurred, `char` is not present in the modified `s` string. If the current length of `res` is 26, the program continues execution. Otherwise, if the length of `res` is not equal to 26, -1 is printed.***
