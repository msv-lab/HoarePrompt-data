According to the code, the loop will execute as long as both `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Right before the loop, `s` is assigned the input string provided by the user, `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of string `s` and `j` needs to be less than 26. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is assigned the input string provided by the user, `target` is the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` needs to be less than the length of string `s`, and `j` needs to be less than 26**
