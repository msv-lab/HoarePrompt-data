Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has. It calculates the maximum number of compotes Nikolay can make based on the ratio given in the problem description. The program calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used by taking the minimum of lemons, half of apples, and one-fourth of pears. Then it calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the maximum number of lemons by 1, apples by 2, and pears by 4. The output is the total number of possible fruits for making compotes. The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as described.
