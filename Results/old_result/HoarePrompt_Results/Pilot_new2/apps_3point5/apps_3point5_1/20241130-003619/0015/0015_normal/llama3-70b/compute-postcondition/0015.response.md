Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integer values `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if they are equal, 'NO' otherwise. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the division result is non-negative, then prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely on user input.**
