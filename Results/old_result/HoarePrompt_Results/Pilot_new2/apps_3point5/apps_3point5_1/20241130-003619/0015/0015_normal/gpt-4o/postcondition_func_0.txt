The function reads three integers a, b, and c from input. It then checks if b is equal to a and prints 'YES'. If b is not equal to a, it checks if c is equal to 0 and prints 'NO'. If c is not 0, it verifies if the difference between b and a is divisible by c and the result of the division is non-negative. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function handles cases where b equals a, c is 0, and the division result is negative.
