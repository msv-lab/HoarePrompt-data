Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads three integers a, b, and c from the input.
- It then checks if b is equal to a and prints 'YES' as per the problem description.
- If b is not equal to a, it checks if c is equal to 0 and prints 'NO' as expected by the description.
- Next, it verifies if the difference between b and a is divisible by c and the result of the division is non-negative. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES' as specified in the problem statement.
- The code handles cases where b equals a, c is 0, and the division result is negative, fulfilling the requirements. 
- The output hints also agree with the code logic and accurately describe the functionality of the program. Since all described cases are correctly handled by the code, the correctness is determined as True.
