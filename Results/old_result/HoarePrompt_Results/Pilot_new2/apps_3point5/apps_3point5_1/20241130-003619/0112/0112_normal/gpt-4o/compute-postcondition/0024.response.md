According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If there are more digits left in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing separate digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements all set to True, `found` is True. After not entering the if block, found is still True. So, for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more digit left in the `digits` list.
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing separate digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements all set to True, `found` is True, at least one more digit left in the `digits` list**
