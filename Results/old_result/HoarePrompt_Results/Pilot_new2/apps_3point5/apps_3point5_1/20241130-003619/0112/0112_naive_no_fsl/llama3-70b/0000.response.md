Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, extracts all unique digits from the cubes (excluding '0'), sorts them in descending order, and constructs the maximum number that can be formed from those digits. It follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all given test cases. There are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description.
