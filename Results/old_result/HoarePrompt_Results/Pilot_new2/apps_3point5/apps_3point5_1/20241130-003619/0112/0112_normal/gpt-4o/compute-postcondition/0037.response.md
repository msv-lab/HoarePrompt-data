According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `n`, and the conditions within the loop. At the end of the last iteration, the following conditions are present: `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing separate digits of `num`, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `found` is True, at least one more digit left in the `digits` list, `i+1` is within the range of `n`, `used_cubes[i+1]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i+1], and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing separate digits of `num`, `used_cubes[i+1]` is True, `found` is True, at least one more digit left in the `digits` list, `i+2` is within the range of `n`, `used_cubes[i+2]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i+2], and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
