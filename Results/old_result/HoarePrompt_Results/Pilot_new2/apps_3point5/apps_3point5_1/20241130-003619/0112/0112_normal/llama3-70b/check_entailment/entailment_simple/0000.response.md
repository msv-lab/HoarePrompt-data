Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully satisfy the requirements of the problem description. The program does not consider the restriction that Masha cannot make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. This means that the program may output a number that is not actually possible to form using the given cubes due to the restriction mentioned.

Therefore, the program needs to be modified to take into account the restriction on digits 6 and 9 when forming the maximum number x that Masha can make.
