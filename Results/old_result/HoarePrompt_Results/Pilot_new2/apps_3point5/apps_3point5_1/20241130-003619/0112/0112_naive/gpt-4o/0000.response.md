Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by checking if Masha can form numbers from 1 to x using the given cubes. It iterates through all possible numbers starting from 1 and checks if each digit can be formed using the available cubes. The function can_form_number checks if a number can be formed using the cubes and returns True if it can, otherwise False. The program incrementally increases x until a number cannot be formed. The approach covers all possible cases and accurately determines the maximum number x that can be formed.
