According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables `i` and `n`, as well as the conditions related to `used_cubes[i]` and `digit`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements with the ith element set to True, `found` is True, at least one more digit left in the `digits` list, `i` is within the range of `n`, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a non-empty list containing separate digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements with the i+1th element set to True, `found` is True, at least one more digit left in the `digits` list, `i+1` is within the range of `n`, `used_cubes[i+1]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i+1] and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
