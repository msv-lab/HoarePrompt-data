Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. `a` is assigned the first integer obtained by splitting the input, and `b` is assigned the second integer obtained by splitting the input. `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`. `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`. `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.**
