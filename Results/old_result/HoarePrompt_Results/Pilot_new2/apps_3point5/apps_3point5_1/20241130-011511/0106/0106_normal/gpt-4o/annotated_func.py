    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *block_a, block_b, floor_a, floor_b are assigned the return values of the functions get_location(a) and get_location(b). If floor_a is equal to 1, time_to_exit is set to 0. If floor_a is not equal to 1, time_to_exit is equal to 10 + (floor_a - 1).

    #The program returns the total time taken to move from block_a to block_b considering the floor transitions and walking time, where direct_walk_time is calculated as the absolute value of (block_a - block_b) modulo n multiplied by 15, reverse_walk_time is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) modulo n multiplied by 15, min_walk_time is the minimum value between direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time, time_to_target_floor is (floor_b - 1) * 5, and total_time is the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts 5 integer parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the total time taken to move from `block_a` to `block_b` considering floor transitions and walking time. The direct_walk_time is calculated as the absolute value of `(block_a - block_b) modulo n` multiplied by 15. The reverse_walk_time is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) modulo n` multiplied by 15. The min_walk_time is the minimum value between direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time. The time_to_target_floor is `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. The total_time is the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: apartment is an integer representing the apartment number where Edward or Natasha lives.**
def get_location(apartment):
    block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1
    floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)
    floor = floor_within_block // k + 1
    return block, floor
    #The program returns the block number and the floor number within the block where the apartment is located divided by 'k' plus 1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `get_location` accepts an integer `apartment` representing the apartment number where Edward or Natasha lives. It calculates and returns the block number and the floor number within the block where the apartment is located divided by 'k' plus 1. The function correctly handles the calculation of block and floor numbers based on the apartment number.
