Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input for positive integers n, m, k, a, and b. It calculates the floor and block numbers for values a and b. Then, it determines the minimum time required to move between blocks and floors based on the calculated values. Finally, it prints the sum of the minimum block time and the minimum floor time. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
