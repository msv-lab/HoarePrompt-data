Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of variables needed to perform the sequence of operations as described in the problem. It sorts the input sequence of numbers and then iterates through it to check if each number is double the previous number. If not, it increments the variable count. This logic ensures that the minimum number of variables required to perform the sequence is calculated correctly for all possible cases. The program also handles the case where the number of variables exceeds 23 by outputting -1 in that scenario. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases, it can be considered correct.
