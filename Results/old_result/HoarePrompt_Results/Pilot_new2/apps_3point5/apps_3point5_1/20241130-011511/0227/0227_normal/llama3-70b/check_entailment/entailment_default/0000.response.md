Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input of `n` and a list of integers `a`.
- It then sorts the list `a` which is necessary to determine the minimum number of variables `m`.
- The code iterates over the sorted list and increments `m` by 1 when an element `a[i]` is not twice the value of the previous element `a[i-1] + 1`, which aligns with the requirement of assigning the sum of two previous variable values to the current variable in the sequence of operations.
- Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1, which covers the condition mentioned in the problem description.
- The code logic follows the problem description for every potential case and the output hints provided are also in agreement with the code. 

Therefore, the code is correct and yields the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the described sequence of operations as per the given problem description.
