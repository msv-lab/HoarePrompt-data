Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates over the input numbers, sorts them, and uses a set to keep track of the assigned values. It checks if the difference between the current number and any previously assigned number is present in the set, indicating whether the sequence of operations can be performed. The program then returns the minimum number of variables required for the operations. The logic seems sound and covers all possible cases as per the problem description.
