The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, then sorts the list `a`. It iterates over the sorted list and increments `m` by 1 every time an element `a[i]` is not twice the value of the previous element `a[i-1] + 1`. Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly and works based on user input.
