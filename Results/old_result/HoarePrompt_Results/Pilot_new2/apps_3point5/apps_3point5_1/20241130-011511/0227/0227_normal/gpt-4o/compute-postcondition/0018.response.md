Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least one element, `assigned` is a set containing the remaining elements of list `a` after `x` has been iterated over, `m` is 1, `i` is the index of the next element in list `a`, `can_form` is True, `x` is the next element to be iterated over in the set `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, the loop or if statement is broken out of without any changes to the variables.***
