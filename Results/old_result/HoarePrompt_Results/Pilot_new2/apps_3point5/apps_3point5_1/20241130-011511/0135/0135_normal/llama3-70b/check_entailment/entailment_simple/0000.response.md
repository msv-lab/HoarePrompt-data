Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It checks if all the remainders obtained by dividing n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of the remainders seen so far, and if it encounters a remainder that is already in the set, it prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' after looping through all remainders.

The program ensures that there are no repeated remainders, as required by the problem description. Thus, it is correct and meets all the requirements.
