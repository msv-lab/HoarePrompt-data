Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It checks if all the remainders of division of n by integers from 1 to k are distinct and returns "Yes" if they are and "No" otherwise. The program correctly handles the edge case where k >= n and returns "No" in that case. The program uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and returns "No" if it encounters a duplicate remainder, otherwise it returns "Yes". Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
