According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is in the range from 1 to `k` inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` and `k` must be integers in the range from 1 to 10^18, and `seen` is an empty set. Before the loop starts, `n` and `k` are already assigned with the integer values input by the user, so no adjustments are needed for them. 
State: **`n` and `k` are integers in the range 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, `seen` is an empty set**
