Output State: `n`, `k` are integers in the range 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the remainders of n % i for all i from 1 to n and (n % (k + 1)), `remainder` is the remainder of n % i. If the remainder of n % i is in the set `seen`, the program prints 'No'. `seen` is updated with the addition of `remainder`.
