Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers in the range 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the remainders of n % i for all i from 1 to n and (n % (k + 1)), `remainder` is the remainder of n % i, `i` is the next integer value within the range 1 to k. If the remainder of n % i is already in the set `seen`, then the program retains the same state as the pre-condition.***
