Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly checks if all the remainders of n divided by integers from 1 to k are distinct. It does this by iterating through all integers from 1 to k, calculating the remainder of n divided by each integer, and checking if the remainder has been seen before using a set. If any remainder is found to be a duplicate, the program immediately returns 'No', indicating that not all remainders are distinct. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes', indicating that all remainders are distinct.

The program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. For example, if n=4 and k=4, the remainders modulo 1 and 4 coincide, leading to the correct output 'No'. If n=5 and k=3, all remainders are distinct, leading to the correct output 'Yes'. Overall, the program functions as expected and satisfies the requirements of the problem description.
