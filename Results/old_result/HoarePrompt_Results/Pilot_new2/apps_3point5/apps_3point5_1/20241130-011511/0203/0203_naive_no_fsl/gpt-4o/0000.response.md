Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description and implements the logic described for the voting procedure. It maintains separate queues for depublicans and remocrats, and processes the votes according to the rules specified in the problem. The program considers the scenario where an employee denies another employee the right to vote, and continues the voting process until only one employee is left eligible to vote.

The program uses the queues to keep track of the order in which employees from each fraction are going to vote and appropriately adjusts the indices based on whether a depublican or remocrat denies the right to vote. The final outcome is determined correctly based on which queue still has elements, with 'D' representing depublicans and 'R' representing remocrats.

All the provided examples are correctly handled by the program, and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. Hence, the correctness of the program is confirmed to be True.
