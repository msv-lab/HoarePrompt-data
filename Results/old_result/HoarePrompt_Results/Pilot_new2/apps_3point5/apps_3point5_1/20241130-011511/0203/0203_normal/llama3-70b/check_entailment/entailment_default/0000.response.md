Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue arises when an employee denies the right to vote of another employee. The code simply counts the total number of 'D's and 'R's in the input string and then prints 'D' if there are more 'D's than 'R's, and 'R' otherwise. However, the code does not take into consideration the specific order of denials made by the employees, which is crucial to determining the outcome of the vote. 

For example, consider the input:
5
DDRRR

In this case, the correct outcome should be 'D' based on the specific order of denials as mentioned in the problem description. However, the code will output 'R' because it only compares the total count of 'D's and 'R's without considering the denials in the correct order.
