The function `func` reads an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string of characters 'D' or 'R'. It categorizes the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters into separate queues, then processes these queues based on their indices. It iterates over the queues, moving indices by `n` positions if the 'D' index is smaller than the 'R' index. Finally, it prints 'D' if the 'D' queue is not empty, otherwise 'R'.
