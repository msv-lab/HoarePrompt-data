Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, `n` remains the same as the original input integer between 1 and 200,000. `votes` still contains the input string stripped of any leading or trailing whitespace. `d_queue` is empty as all elements have been removed, and `r_queue` contains the elements that were not processed. The final values of `d_index` and `r_index` depend on the operations performed during the loop iterations, where `d_index` and `r_index` are the last values assigned to them during the loop execution. Additionally, `d_queue` is empty so the if condition `(d_queue)` evaluates to false***
