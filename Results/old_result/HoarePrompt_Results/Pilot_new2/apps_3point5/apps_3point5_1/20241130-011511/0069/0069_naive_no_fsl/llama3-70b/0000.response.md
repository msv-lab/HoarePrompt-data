Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, length of string $s$, desired balance $x$, and the binary string $s$.
2. It calculates the count of 0's and 1's in the string $s$ and then calculates the balance as $cnt_{0,q} - cnt_{1,q}$.
3. The program then checks three conditions:
   - If the balance is equal to $x$, it prints $n + 1$ as the number of prefixes.
   - If $(x - balance) \% (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0$, it prints -1 indicating an infinite number of prefixes.
   - Otherwise, it calculates the number of prefixes based on the formula and prints it.
4. The program provides the correct output for the given example and follows the problem description for each test case.
