Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0 of length n + 1, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count = 1`. Additionally, after entering the if condition, `x` and `b` satisfy the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0)***
