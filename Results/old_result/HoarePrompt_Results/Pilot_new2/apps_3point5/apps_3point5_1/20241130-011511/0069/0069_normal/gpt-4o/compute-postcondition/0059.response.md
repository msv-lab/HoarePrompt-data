Postcondition: ***`balance` is calculated based on the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0, `i` is equal to `n`, the current value of `i` is equal to `n`. After the if condition, the current value of `balance` is 0. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` list contains -1. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` list has a new element appended which is 0.***
