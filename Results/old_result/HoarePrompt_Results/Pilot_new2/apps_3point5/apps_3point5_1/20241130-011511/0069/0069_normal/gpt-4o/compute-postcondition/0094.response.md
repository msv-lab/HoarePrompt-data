Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of running balances starting from 0 of length n + 1 where the ith element is the sum of the ith element in the previous list and 1 if s[i - 1] is equal to '0' and -1 otherwise. `n` is the length of the string `s`. If balance is 0, then the current value of balance is 0. After the execution of the if else block, if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `results` contains the value -1. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then a new element 0 is added to `results`.***
