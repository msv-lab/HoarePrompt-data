Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect. It does not correctly handle cases where there are an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance. The program incorrectly checks if the desired balance exists in the prefix_balances list, which is not the correct approach to determine if there are an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance.

Additionally, the program's logic for counting the number of prefixes with the desired balance is flawed and may not produce the correct result for all test cases.

Overall, the program does not adhere to the problem description and may produce incorrect outputs for certain cases.
