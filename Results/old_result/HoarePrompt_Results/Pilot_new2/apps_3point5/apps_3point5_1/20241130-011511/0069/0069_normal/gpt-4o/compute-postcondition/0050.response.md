Output State: **`balance` is calculated based on the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of 0s with a length of `n+1`, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the new calculated value after executing the code `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**.
