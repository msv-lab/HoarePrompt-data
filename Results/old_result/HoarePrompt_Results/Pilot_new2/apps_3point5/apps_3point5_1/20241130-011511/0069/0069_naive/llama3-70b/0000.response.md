Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with balance equal to $x$ as described in the problem statement. It considers all possible cases including when the balance is already equal to $x$, when the balance difference is divisible evenly by the difference in counts of '0' and '1', and when the balance can be reached by adding multiples of the difference in counts of '0' and '1'. The logic covers all scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each test case.
