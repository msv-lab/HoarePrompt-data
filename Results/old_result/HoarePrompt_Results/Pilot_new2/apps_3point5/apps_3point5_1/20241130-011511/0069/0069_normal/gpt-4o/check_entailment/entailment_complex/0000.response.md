Correctness: **False**

The program does not always follow the problem description. 

One key issue is that the program does not correctly handle cases where there is an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance. According to the problem description, when the number of prefixes is infinite, the program should output -1. However, the program does not have a condition to check for this scenario and always calculates and outputs a count of prefixes.

Additionally, the program has a logic issue in the condition where balance is equal to 0. The program checks if the desired balance `x` is in the list `prefix_balances`, which is incorrect. Instead, it should be checking if there are any occurrences of 0 in the `prefix_balances` list. 

Therefore, the program does not always meet the requirements of the problem description.
