The function `func_2` accepts an integer `x`, calculates all the divisors of `x`, and returns a sorted list of these divisors in reverse order. The function correctly identifies divisors of `x` using a set to avoid duplicates. However, the code does not handle the case where x is less than 1, which could lead to unexpected behavior. It is expected that `x` should be a positive integer greater than or equal to 1 for the function to work effectively.
