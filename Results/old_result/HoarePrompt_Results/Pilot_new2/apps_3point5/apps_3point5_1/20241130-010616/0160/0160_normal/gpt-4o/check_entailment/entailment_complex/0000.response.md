Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in a given list.
2. The function `func_2` correctly identifies all the divisors of a given integer `x` and returns them in reverse order. Although the annotation mentions a potential issue with `x` being less than 1, the problem description specifies that `A_i` values are between 1 and 10^6, so the code is valid in that context.
