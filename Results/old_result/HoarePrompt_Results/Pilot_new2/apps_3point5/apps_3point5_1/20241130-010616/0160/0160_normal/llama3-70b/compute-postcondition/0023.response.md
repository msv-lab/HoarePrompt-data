According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1` and `gcd % i == 0` where `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N, K, A_i, gcd, max_divisor` are integers. If `gcd % i == 0` where `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of dividing `gcd` by `i`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to find the next integer `i` in the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1` for which `gcd % i == 0` and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`. 

State: **`N, K, A_i, gcd` are integers, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`, where `i` is the next integer in the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1` for which `gcd % i == 0` and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`.**
