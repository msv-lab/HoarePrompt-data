According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `i` in the range from 1 to the square root of `gcd` + 1. In order for the loop to execute, `gcd` must be a positive integer greater than 0. 
State: **`N, K, A_i, gcd` where gcd is a positive integer greater than 0 and `max_divisor` is assigned the value of gcd, i is in the range from 1 to int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1**
