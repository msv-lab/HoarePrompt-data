Postcondition: ***`N, K, A_i, gcd, max_divisor` are integers. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, where `i` is the next integer in the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1` for which `gcd % i == 0` and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`.***
