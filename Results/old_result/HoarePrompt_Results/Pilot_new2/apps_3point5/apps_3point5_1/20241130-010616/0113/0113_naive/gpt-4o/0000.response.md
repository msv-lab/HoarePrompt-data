Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the k-rounding of n as described in the problem. It calculates the multiplier needed to add the required number of zeros to the end of n and then computes the k-rounding by multiplying n with the multiplier divided by the greatest common divisor of n and the multiplier. The program handles all potential cases correctly and provides the expected output for the given input examples.
