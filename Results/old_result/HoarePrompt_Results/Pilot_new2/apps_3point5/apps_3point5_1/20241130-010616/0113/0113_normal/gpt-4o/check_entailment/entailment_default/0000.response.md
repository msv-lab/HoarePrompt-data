Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly takes two integers n and k as input.
- The program correctly calculates the k-rounding of n using the formula provided in the problem description.
- The function `func_1` calculates a positive integer x by multiplying n with 10^k and dividing by the greatest common divisor of n and 10^k, which aligns with the problem description.
- The examples provided in the problem description are valid and the output of the program matches those examples.
- The program handles all cases where n is a positive integer in the range [1, 10^9] and k is in the range [0, 8].
