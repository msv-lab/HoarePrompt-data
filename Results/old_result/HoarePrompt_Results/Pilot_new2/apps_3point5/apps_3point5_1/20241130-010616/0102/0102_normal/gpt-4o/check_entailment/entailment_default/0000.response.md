Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes an integer `n` as input and returns the word representation of `n` based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the description, including numbers in the range [0, 9], [11, 19], and [20, 99]. The code uses the 'ones', 'teens', and 'tens' lists to correctly determine the word representation of the input integer. Additionally, the function handles cases where the input number is divisible by 10 by returning the word representation of the tens place digit. The hyphen is used to separate the word representation of the tens and ones places when necessary. Since the code aligns with the problem description and all the provided examples work correctly, the correctness of the code is True.
