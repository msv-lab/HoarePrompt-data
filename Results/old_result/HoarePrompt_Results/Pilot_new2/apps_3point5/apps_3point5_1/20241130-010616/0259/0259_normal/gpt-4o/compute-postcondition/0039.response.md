The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of that route. After executing the function body, the program returns the route with the minimum wait time, which is stored in `chosen_route`. The `chosen_route` consists of two elements: `s_i` and `d_i`, where `s_i` is the starting point and `d_i` is the destination point of the route. The `wait_time` is either equal to `min_wait_time` or the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the number of bus routes, the time Serval goes to the station, and a list of bus routes with their arrival times and intervals, and then determine the route with the minimum wait time and return the starting and destination points of that route along with the wait time.
