According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 2, and `chosen_route` must be reassigned the value `i + 1`. 
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of n tuples, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is equal to 2, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the first element of the tuple at index 2, `d_i` is the second element of the tuple at index 2, `wait_time` is calculated as per the given conditions**.
