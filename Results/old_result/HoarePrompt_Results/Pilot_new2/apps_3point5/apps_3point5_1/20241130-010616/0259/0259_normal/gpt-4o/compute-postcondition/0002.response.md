According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of n tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
