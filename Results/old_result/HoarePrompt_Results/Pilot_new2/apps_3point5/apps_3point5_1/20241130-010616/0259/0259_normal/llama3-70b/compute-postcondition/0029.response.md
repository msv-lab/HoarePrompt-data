Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains at least 3 tuples, `_` is `n-1`, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from the third tuple in the `buses` list, `min_time` is equal to the current value of `time`, `ans` is `i + 1`, `i` is 2, `time` is equal to `(t - s) % d`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, all the variables retain their original values after the execution of the if else block.***
