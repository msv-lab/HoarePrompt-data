According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `buses` is an empty list. So, for the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted: `n` must be at least 1, and `_` can be assumed to be 0.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
