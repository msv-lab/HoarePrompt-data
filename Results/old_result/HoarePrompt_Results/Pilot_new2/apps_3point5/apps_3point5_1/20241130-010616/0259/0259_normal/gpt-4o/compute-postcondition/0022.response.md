Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of n tuples, `min_wait_time` is calculated, `chosen_route` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the tuple at index `i`, `d_i` is the second element of the tuple at index `i`, `s_i` is the first element of the tuple at index `i`, `d_i` is the second element of the tuple at index `i`, and `wait_time` is either 0 if (t - s_i) % d_i == 0 or calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` if the condition is not met.***
