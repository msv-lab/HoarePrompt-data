According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list has at least 1 tuple, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity and `ans` is -1. So, for the loop to be executed, the list `buses` must have at least 1 tuple, and `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values from the first tuple in the list `buses`.
State: **`n` is at least 1, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `_` is `n-1`, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from the first tuple in the `buses` list, `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0**
