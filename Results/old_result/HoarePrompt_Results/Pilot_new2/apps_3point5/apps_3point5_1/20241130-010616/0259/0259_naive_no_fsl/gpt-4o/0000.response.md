Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input by splitting the input string and converting the values to integers.
2. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the wait time for each bus route and determines the chosen route based on the minimum wait time.
3. The program then prints the chosen route which is the bus route Serval will use.
4. The logic in the `func_1` function handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement, including the case where Serval arrives after the first bus of a route but before the subsequent buses.
