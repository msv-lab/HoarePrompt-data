Postcondition: ***a is a non-negative integer represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits. If a is false (0 as a string), b is assigned the value of the string at index 1 of the list data after removing leading zeros. The current value of b is false (0). The length of a is greater than or equal to the length of b. Additionally, the length of a is greater than the length of b and the current state of the program is within the if condition.***
