Functionality: **The function takes two non-negative integers represented as strings with at most 10^6 digits, compares them, and prints whether the first integer is less than, equal to, or greater than the second integer. The function handles cases where the input strings contain leading zeros by removing them. The code does not explicitly return any value, but it prints the result of the comparison.**
