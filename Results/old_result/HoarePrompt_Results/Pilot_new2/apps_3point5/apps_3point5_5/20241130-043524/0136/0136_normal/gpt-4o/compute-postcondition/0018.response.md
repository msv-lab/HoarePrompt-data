Postcondition: ***a is a non-negative integer represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits. b is assigned the value of the string at index 1 of the list data after removing leading zeros if a is false (0 as a string) or b was already assigned a value. The current value of b is false (0). The length of a is greater than or equal to the length of b and the length of a is less than or equal to the length of b. The condition (a < b) is false, indicating that a is greater than or equal to b. The current value of a is greater than b.***
