Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with at most 10^6 digits. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, then `b` is assigned the value of the string at index 1 of the list data after removing leading zeros. If the length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, the final state of the program depends on the relationship between `a` and `b`, with `b` being updated based on specific criteria related to the comparison of `a` and `b`.***
