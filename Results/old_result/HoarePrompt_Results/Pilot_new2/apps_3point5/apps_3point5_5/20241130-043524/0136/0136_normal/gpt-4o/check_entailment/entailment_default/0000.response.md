Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
Upon initial assessment, the code seems to be following the problem description accurately. The function takes two non-negative integers represented as strings with at most 10^6 digits, compares them, and prints whether the first integer is less than, equal to, or greater than the second integer. The code handles cases where the input strings contain leading zeros by removing them. It correctly compares the lengths of the integers and the actual integer values to determine the relationship between them. 

The output hints also align with the code by describing the functionality of comparing the integers and printing the appropriate symbol ("<", ">", or "=") based on the comparison results.

After careful consideration, there doesn't seem to be any edge cases or scenarios where the code would not work as expected based on the problem description and the provided examples. Overall, the code seems to be correct in fulfilling the requirements specified.
