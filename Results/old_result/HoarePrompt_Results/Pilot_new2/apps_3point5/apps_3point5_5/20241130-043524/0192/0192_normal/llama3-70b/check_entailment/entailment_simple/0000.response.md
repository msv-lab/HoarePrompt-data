Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The provided program simply calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem as described in the problem description. The problem requires finding the minimum number of seconds required to transform an equilateral triangle of side length x to a side length y by modifying the length of a single side at a time, while ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate.

The program does not perform the necessary operations to transform the triangle as required by the problem description. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the given problem.
