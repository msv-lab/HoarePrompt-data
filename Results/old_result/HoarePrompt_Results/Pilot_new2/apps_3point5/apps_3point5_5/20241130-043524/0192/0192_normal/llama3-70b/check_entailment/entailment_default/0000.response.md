Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given code takes two integers x and y as input, representing the side lengths of the equilateral triangles. It then calculates and prints the absolute difference between x and y, which corresponds to the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y starting from x.

The code follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases. It correctly handles the scenarios where y is less than x and ensures that the output is the absolute difference between x and y, representing the minimum number of seconds required. 

The output hints validate the code by confirming that it calculates the absolute difference between x and y, which aligns with the requirements of the problem description. Therefore, based on the code implementation, the problem description, and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct and provides the expected output for all valid cases.
