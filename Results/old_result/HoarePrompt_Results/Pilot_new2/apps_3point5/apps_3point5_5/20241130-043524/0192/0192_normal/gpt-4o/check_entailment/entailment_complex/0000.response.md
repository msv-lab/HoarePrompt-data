Correctness: **True**

The annotated program accurately implements the logic described in the problem description. It reads two integers `x` and `y`, then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length `y` starting from the equilateral triangle of side length `x`. The calculation of ((x - y) // 2) + ((x - y) % 2) correctly determines the minimum number of seconds needed based on the difference in side lengths. The program meets all the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
