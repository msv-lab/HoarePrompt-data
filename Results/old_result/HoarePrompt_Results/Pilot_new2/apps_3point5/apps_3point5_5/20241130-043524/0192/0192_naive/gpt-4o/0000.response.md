Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y starting from an equilateral triangle of side length x. The program takes the input values x and y, calculates the difference between them, divides by 2, and adds the remainder if the difference is odd. This logic holds true for all potential cases where x and y are within the specified range (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000). Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program. Therefore, the program is correct in fulfilling the requirements of the problem.
