Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
The provided program simply calculates and prints the absolute difference between x and y, which is not the correct solution to the problem described. The problem requires finding the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x by modifying the side lengths in a way that the triangle remains non-degenerate.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description and does not provide the correct solution.
