Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of two positive integers `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. This is necessary for simplifying the fraction A/B.
- The function `func_2` first checks if `k` is greater than 2^n, and if so, it prints 1 1 as the output, which is correct as in that scenario, it is guaranteed that at least two people share the same birthday.
- For other cases where `k` is less than or equal to 2^n, the function correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday among `k` people in a year of 2^n days long. It calculates the values of `numerator` and `denominator` using a loop, then computes `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, and `p_shared` based on the calculated values. Finally, it adjusts the values of A and B using the `func_1` function and prints the remainders of A and B after division by MOD.
- The code handles the scenario where k is greater than 2^n and appropriately prints 1 1, and for other cases, it correctly calculates the probability as per the problem description. The code also accounts for large inputs by performing all calculations modulo 10^6 + 3. Overall, the code functions correctly for all potential cases described in the problem statement.
