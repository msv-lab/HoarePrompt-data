According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is at least 2. Before the loop starts, the variables that need to be adjusted are `i` which should start from 0, and `k` which should be at least 2.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; MOD is assigned the value 10^6 + 3; total_days is equal to 2^n; numerator is assigned the value 1; denominator is assigned the value 1, `i` is 0, `k` is at least 2**
