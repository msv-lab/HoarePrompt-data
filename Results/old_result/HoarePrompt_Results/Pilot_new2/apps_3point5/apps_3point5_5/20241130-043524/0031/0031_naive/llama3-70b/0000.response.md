Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a given set of days. It calculates the numerator and denominator using the formula for calculating probabilities and then reduces the fraction to its irreducible form using the `math.gcd` function. The program then returns the remainders of the numerator and denominator modulo 10^6 + 3. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
