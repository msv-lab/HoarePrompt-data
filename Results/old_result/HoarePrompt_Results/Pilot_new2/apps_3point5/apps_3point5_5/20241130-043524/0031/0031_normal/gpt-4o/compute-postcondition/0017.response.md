Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; MOD is assigned the value 10^6 + 3; total_days is equal to 2^n; numerator is assigned the value `(total_days - k) * (total_days - k + 1) * ... * (total_days - 1) % MOD`; denominator is assigned the value `total_days * (total_days - 1) * ... * 2 % MOD`; `i` is equal to `k`; `k` must be greater than or equal to 2**
