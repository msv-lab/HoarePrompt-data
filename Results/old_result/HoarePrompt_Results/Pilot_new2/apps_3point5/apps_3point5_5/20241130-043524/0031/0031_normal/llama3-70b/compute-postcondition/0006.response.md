According to the code, the loop can execute if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration will be:
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; total_days is equal to 2 raised to the power of n; numerator is equal to total_days; denominator is equal to 2 raised to the power of n; i is 1**
