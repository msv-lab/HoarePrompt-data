The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. It calculates the values of `numerator` and `denominator` based on the input `n` and `k`, then computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `numerator` and `denominator`. After that, it returns the remainders of `numerator` and `denominator` divided by (10^6 + 3). The functionality does not cover potential edge cases explicitly stated in the annotations, such as division by zero or the possibility of errors if the input constraints are not met.
