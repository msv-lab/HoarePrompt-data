Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `shares` contains the total number of shares earned after dividing and updating `r` by each element in `s`, `r` contains the final remainder after the division is completed for all elements in `s`. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is incremented by the product of `shares` and `b[i]` and `shares` becomes 0. If shares is less than or equal to 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
