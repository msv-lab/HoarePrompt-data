Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description by reading the input values, sorting the lists, calculating the total number of shares bought based on the remainder `r`, and then updating the total money after selling the shares. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description, and it handles the cases of buying and selling shares as described. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
