Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input. `s` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the `int` function to the input split by spaces, `b` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the `int` function to the input split by spaces. `min_buy_price` is equal to the minimum value in list `s`. `max_sell_price` is equal to the maximum value in list `b`. Additionally, the maximum sell price is greater than the minimum buy price. `max_shares` is equal to the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`. `remaining_bourles` is equal to the remainder of the division of `r` by `min_buy_price`.**
