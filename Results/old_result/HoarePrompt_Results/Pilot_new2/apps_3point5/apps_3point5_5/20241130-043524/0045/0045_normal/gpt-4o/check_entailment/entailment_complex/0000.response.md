Correctness: **True**

The annotated program calculates a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers a_1, a_2, ..., a_{k}, such that their sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor is maximal. It correctly handles the case where there is no possible sequence by returning -1. The calculation of the sequence and the handling of edge cases are done correctly. The program meets the requirements set in the problem description.
