According to the code, the loop will execute k times starting from k-1 and ending at 0. Since k is a positive integer, the loop will definitely execute. 

For the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; min_sum is k * (k + 1) // 2 and min_sum is less than or equal to n; d is n divided by min_sum; remainder is n - d * min_sum; sequence is a list of values where each value is d times the index plus 1 for indices ranging from 0 to k-1, i is k-1**
