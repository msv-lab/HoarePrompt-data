The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

Case_1: If the conditions are not met, the program returns -1.

Case_2: If the conditions are met, the program returns a list 'sequence' where each value is d times the index plus 1 for indices ranging from 0 to k-1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and either return -1 or return a list 'sequence' based on the conditions specified.
