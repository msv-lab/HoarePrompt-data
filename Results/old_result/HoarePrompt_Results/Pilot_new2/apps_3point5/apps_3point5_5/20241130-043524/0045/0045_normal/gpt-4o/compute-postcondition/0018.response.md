According to the code, the loop can execute as long as i is within the range of k-1 to 0. At the end of the last iteration, i is k-2. To execute the loop one more time, i needs to be decremented by 1 to become k-3.
State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. min_sum is k * (k + 1) // 2 and min_sum is less than or equal to n. d is n divided by min_sum. remainder is n - d * min_sum - 2. sequence is a list of values where each value is d times the index plus 1 for indices ranging from 0 to k-1. i is k-3. sequence[i] is incremented by 2 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
