    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop finishes executing, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. min_sum is k * (k + 1) // 2 and min_sum is less than or equal to n. d is n divided by min_sum. remainder is 0. sequence is a list of values where each value is d times the index plus 1 for indices ranging from 0 to k-1.
    return sequence
    #The program returns a list 'sequence' where each value is d times the index plus 1 for indices ranging from 0 to k-1
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculates the minimum sum using k, and checks if the minimum sum exceeds n. If the minimum sum is greater than n, the function returns -1. If the conditions are met, it calculates a list 'sequence' where each value is derived based on specific calculations for indices ranging from 0 to k-1, and returns this list.
