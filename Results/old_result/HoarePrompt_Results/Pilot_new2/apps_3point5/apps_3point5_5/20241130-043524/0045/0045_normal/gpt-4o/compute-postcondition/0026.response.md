Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculates the minimum sum using k, and checks if the minimum sum exceeds n. If the minimum sum is greater than n, the function returns -1. If the conditions are met, it calculates a list 'sequence' where each value is derived based on specific calculations for indices ranging from 0 to k-1, and returns this list.**
