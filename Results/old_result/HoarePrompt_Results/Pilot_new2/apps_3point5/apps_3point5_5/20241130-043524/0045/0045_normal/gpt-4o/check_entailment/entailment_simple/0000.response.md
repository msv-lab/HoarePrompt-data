Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the minimum sum that can be achieved with a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers. If the minimum sum is greater than the given n, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates the value of d by dividing n by the minimum sum. Then, it constructs a sequence of k positive numbers that are strictly increasing and have a greatest common divisor that is maximized. The program ensures that the sum of the sequence is equal to n.
