The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`, which is an integer representing the apartment number where Edward or Natasha live. The function calculates and returns the block number and the floor number within the block based on the given apartment number. The block number is calculated as (`apartment` - 1) // (`m` * `k`) + 1, and the floor number is calculated as (`apartment` - 1) % (`m` * `k`) // `k` + 1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and calculate and return the block number and the floor number within the block based on the given apartment number.
