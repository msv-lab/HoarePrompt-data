Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given constraints and scenarios explained in the problem description. The program uses functions to calculate the block and floor numbers for Edward and Natasha's apartments, calculates the time for Edward to exit his apartment and reach Natasha's apartment by considering walking and elevator times, and returns the total time.

The program handles the cases where Edward and Natasha are on different blocks or floors, takes into account the circular nature of the building, and correctly calculates the time needed for Edward to navigate to Natasha's apartment. Hence, the program is correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
