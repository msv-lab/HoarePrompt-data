The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, all of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000 and 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k. The function returns the total time taken to go from floor `a` to floor `b`, considering the block numbers, floor numbers, and walking times. 
Functionality: **The function accepts integers n, m, k, a, and b, and returns the total time taken to go from floor a to floor b, considering the block numbers, floor numbers, and walking times.**
