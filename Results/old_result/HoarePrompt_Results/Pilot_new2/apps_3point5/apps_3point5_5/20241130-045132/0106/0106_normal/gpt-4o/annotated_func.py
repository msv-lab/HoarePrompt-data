    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n, m, k, a, b are integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000 and 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k. block_a is the block number where a is located, floor_a is the floor number where a is located, block_b is the block number where b is located, floor_b is the floor number where b is located. If floor_a == 1, the current value of floor_a is 1 and time_to_exit is 0. If floor_a is not equal to 1, time_to_exit = 10 + (floor_a - 1)

    #The program returns the total time taken to go from floor_a to floor_b, considering the block numbers, floor numbers, and walking times
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts integers n, m, k, a, and b representing block numbers, floor numbers, and locations. It calculates the total time taken to travel from floor a to floor b, factoring in walking times between blocks and floors. If floor_a is on the first floor, time_to_exit is 0; otherwise, it is calculated based on the floor_a value. The function then considers direct and reverse walking times between block_a and block_b, selects the minimum time, adds the time to reach the target floor, and returns the total time required for the journey.

    return block, floor
    #The program returns the block number and the floor number within the block based on the given apartment number, where block is calculated as (`apartment` - 1) // (`m` * `k`) + 1 and floor is calculated as (`apartment` - 1) % (`m` * `k`) // `k` + 1.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `get_location` accepts an integer parameter `apartment` representing Edward or Natasha's apartment number. It calculates and returns the block number and the floor number within the block based on the given apartment number. The block number is calculated as (`apartment` - 1) // (`m` * `k`) + 1, and the floor number within the block is calculated as (`apartment` - 1) % (`m` * `k`) // `k` + 1.
