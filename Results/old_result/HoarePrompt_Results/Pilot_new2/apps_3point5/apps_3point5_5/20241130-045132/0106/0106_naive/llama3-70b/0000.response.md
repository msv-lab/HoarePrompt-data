Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given input of the number of entrances, floors, and apartments as well as the apartment numbers of Edward and Natasha. It correctly calculates the floor and block numbers for both apartments, determines the minimum time to move between blocks and floors, and correctly prints the total minimum time needed. The logic is sound and accounts for all possible scenarios outlined in the problem description. There are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
