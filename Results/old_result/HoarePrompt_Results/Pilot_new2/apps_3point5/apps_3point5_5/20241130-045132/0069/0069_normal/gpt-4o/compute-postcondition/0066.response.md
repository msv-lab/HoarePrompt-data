According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list prefix_balances. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, balance is the first element in prefix_balances, prefix_balances has at least 1 element, index is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, prefix_balances must have at least 2 elements, and index should be 1.
State: **index is 1, balance is the second element in prefix_balances, prefix_balances has at least 2 elements.**
