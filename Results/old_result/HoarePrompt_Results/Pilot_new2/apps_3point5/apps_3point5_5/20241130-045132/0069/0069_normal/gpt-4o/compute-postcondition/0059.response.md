Postcondition: ***index increased by n + 1, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1'), prefix_balances is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of the differences in counts of '0' and '1' up to that index in the string `s`, starting from index 0. When the if condition is met (balance == 0), the current value of `balance` is equal to 0. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, a new element -1 is appended to `results`. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, a new element 0 is appended to `results`.***
