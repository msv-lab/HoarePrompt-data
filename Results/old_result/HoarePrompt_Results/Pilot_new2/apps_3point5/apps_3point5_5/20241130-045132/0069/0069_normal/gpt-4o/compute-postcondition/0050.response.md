Output State: **index is increased by 4, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1'), prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n+1, `i` is the next number after the previous iteration, prefix_balances[i] is calculated based on the previous value of prefix_balances[i - 1] and the value of s[i - 1], prefix_balances[i] is updated to be equal to prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)**
