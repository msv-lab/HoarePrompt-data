According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the prefix_balances list. Since the initial balance is not equal to 0, the loop will run. Before the loop starts, the prefix_balances list must have at least 1 element for the loop to execute. At the beginning of the loop, the index should be 0, and the balance should be the first element in the prefix_balances list.
State: **index is 0, balance is the first element in prefix_balances, prefix_balances has at least 1 element**
