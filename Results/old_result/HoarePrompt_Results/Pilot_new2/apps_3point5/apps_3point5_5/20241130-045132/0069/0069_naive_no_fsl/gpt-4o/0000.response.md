Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the balance is 0 correctly. In this case, the program should output -1 if the desired balance (x) is in the prefix balances list. However, the program checks if x is in prefix_balances, which is incorrect. This will lead to wrong outputs for test cases where the balance is 0. 

For example, consider the test case:
Input
1
4 0
1010

Expected Output
-1

The program will output 0 instead of -1 for this test case, which is incorrect. Hence, the program does not meet the requirements mentioned in the problem description.
