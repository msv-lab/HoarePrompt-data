According to the given information, at the end of the previous iteration the initial state is retained. If 'x' is in 'prefix_balances', 'results' list contains -1; otherwise, 'balance' remains 0, 'results' list contains 0, and 'count' is the number of elements in 'prefix_balances' that satisfy the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0). 'prefix_balances' has at least 'n' elements and ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is true.

To prepare for the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust the states as follows:
State: **If 'x' is in 'prefix_balances', 'results' list contains -1; otherwise, 'balance' remains 0, 'results' list contains 0, 'count' is the number of elements in 'prefix_balances' that satisfy the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0), 'prefix_balances' has at least 'n' + 1 elements and ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is true.**
