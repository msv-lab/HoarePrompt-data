Correctness: **True**

The program first reads the input values for `n` and the list `a` of integers. It then sorts the list `a` in ascending order. 

Next, it initializes the variable `m` to 1 and iterates over the list `a`. For each element in the list, it checks if the current element is not twice the value of the previous element. If this condition is met, it increments `m` by 1. This process ensures that `m` is updated to the minimum number of variables required to perform the sequence of operations described in the problem.

Finally, the program prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it prints -1.

The program correctly determines the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the sequence of operations as described in the problem.
