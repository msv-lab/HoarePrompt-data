Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It sorts the list, then iterates through the list to count the number of elements that are not twice the previous element. It increments `m` for each such occurrence. After the loop, it prints the final value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it prints -1. The function does not have explicit return statements.**
