According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are elements in the `assigned` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, the following states were present: n is greater than 2, list `a` contains n+1 distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least two elements, m is 1, i is equal to n-1, x is a different element in the set `assigned`, the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and `x` is in the set `assigned`, can_form is True.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **n is greater than 2, list `a` contains n+1 distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least two elements, m is 1, i is equal to n, x is a different element in the set `assigned`, the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and `x` is in the set `assigned`, can_form is True.**
