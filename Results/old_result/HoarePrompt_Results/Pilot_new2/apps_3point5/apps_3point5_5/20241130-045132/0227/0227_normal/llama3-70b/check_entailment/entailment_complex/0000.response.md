Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the input list of integers in ascending order and then checks if each element is twice the previous element. If not, it increments the variable `m`. Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it prints -1.

The program follows the problem description as it accurately calculates the minimum number of variables needed to perform the sequence of operations as described.
