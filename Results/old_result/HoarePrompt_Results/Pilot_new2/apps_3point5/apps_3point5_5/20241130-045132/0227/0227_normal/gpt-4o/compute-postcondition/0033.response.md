Output State: **n is greater than 1, a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, assigned is a set containing more elements than before, m is either 1 or 2, i is equal to n-2-1, can_form is True, x is a different element in the set `assigned`, the difference between the element at index i in list a and x is in the set `assigned`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
