Correctness: **True**

In this case, the provided Python program correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. The program first reads the input values and sorts them in ascending order. Then, it iterates through the sorted list to check if the current element is exactly double the previous element. If not, it increments the count of variables required. Finally, it prints the count of variables needed if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it prints -1.

The program logic is correct as it follows the problem description accurately. It handles all potential cases where the described sequence of operations can be performed using the minimum number of variables. Hence, the correctness of the program is determined to be **True**.
