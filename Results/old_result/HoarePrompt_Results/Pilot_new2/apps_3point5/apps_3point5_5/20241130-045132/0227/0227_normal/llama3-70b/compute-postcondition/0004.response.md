According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is already a positive integer, `a` is sorted in ascending order, and `m` is assigned the value 1. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `i` needs to be set to 1 as the loop starts with the value 1.
State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), a is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, m is assigned the value 1, i is 1**
