Postcondition: ***n is greater than 2, list `a` contains n+1 distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least two elements, m is 1, i is equal to n-1, x is a different element in the set `assigned`, the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and `x` is in the set `assigned`, can_form is True. If a[i] - x is in `assigned`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
