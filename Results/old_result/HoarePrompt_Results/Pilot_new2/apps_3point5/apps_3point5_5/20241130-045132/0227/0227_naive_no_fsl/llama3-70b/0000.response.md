Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It sorts the input sequence of numbers, then iterates through the sorted sequence to check if each number can be obtained as a sum of the previous number multiplied by 2. If a number cannot be obtained this way, it increments the number of variables needed. Finally, it outputs the minimum number of variables required or -1 if it exceeds the limit. The code covers all potential cases and correctly determines the minimum number of variables needed to perform the described sequence of operations.
