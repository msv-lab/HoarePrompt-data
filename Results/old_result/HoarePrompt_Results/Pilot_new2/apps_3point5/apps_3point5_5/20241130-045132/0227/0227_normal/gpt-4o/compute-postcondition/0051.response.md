According to the code, the loop can execute based on the elements in the `assigned` set. If there are more elements in the set, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than 2, list `a` contains n+1 distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least one element, m is 1, i is equal to n-1, x is one of the elements in the set `assigned`, the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and `x` is in the set `assigned`, and can_form is True. For the loop to execute one more time, x should be a different element from the set `assigned`.
State: **n is greater than 2, list `a` contains n+1 distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least two elements, m is 1, i is equal to n-1, x is a different element in the set `assigned`, the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and `x` is in the set `assigned`, and can_form is True**
