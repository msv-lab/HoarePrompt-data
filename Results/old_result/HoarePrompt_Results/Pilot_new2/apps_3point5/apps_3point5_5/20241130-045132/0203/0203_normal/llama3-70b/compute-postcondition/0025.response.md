Functionality: **The function accepts user input for the number of employees and their political affiliations ('D' for depublicans and 'R' for remocrats). It then calculates the count of each political affiliation and prints 'D' if there are more depublicans than remocrats, and 'R' otherwise. The function does not have any return value.**
