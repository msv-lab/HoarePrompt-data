Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers n and k as input. It then iterates through all integers from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n when divided by each integer, and checks if the remainder is already in the set of seen remainders. If the remainder is already seen, it prints "No" and exits the program. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set of seen remainders. If the loop completes without finding any repeated remainders, it prints "Yes".

The program follows the problem description accurately by checking for distinct remainders and printing "Yes" if all remainders are distinct and "No" otherwise. The logic of the program is correct and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
