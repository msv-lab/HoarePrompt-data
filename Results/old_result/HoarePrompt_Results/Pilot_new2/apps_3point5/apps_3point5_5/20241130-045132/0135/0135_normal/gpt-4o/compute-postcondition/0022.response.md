The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. Depending on the relationship between `n` and `k`, the function returns different strings. 
In Case 1, Case 2, Case 3, and Case 4, the program returns the string 'No'. 
In Case 5, the program returns the string 'Yes'. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and based on their relationship, return either 'Yes' or 'No'.
