Postcondition: ***n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is strictly less than n, k is strictly less than n, seen_remainders is a set containing the remainder, i is 2, remainder is n % 2. If the remainder is in the set seen_remainders, the function returns the string 'No'. Otherwise, it returns None.***
