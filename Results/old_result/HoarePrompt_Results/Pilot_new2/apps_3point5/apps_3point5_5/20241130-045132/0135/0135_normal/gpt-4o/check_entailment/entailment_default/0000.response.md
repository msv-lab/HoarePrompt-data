Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and then checks if all remainders of dividing `n` by `i`, where `i` ranges from 1 to `k`, are distinct. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it returns 'No' as there will be at least one repeated remainder. If a remainder has been seen before, it also returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The implementation aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases as specified. The output hints also confirm that the code is functioning correctly by explaining the logic implemented in the code.
