Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly checks if all remainders are distinct by using a set to keep track of seen remainders. If a remainder is already in the set, it immediately prints "No" and exits the program. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set. The program then prints "Yes" if all remainders are distinct. The logic of the program follows the problem description and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
