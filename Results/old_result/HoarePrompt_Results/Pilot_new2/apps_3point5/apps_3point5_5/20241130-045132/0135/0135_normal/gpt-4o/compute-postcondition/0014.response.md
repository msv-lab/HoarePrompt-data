Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is strictly less than n, seen_remainders is a set containing the remainder, i is 2, remainder is n % 2, remainder has been added to seen_remainders. If remainder was in seen_remainders, the function would return 'No', otherwise it returns None.**
