Postcondition: ***`n` is not involved in loop execution, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the new value of `remainder`, `remainder` is the value of `n` modulo (`i` + 1), where `i` is the current value of `i` in the loop, `remainder` is the value of `n` modulo `i`. If `remainder` is in `seen`, the output displays 'No'.***
