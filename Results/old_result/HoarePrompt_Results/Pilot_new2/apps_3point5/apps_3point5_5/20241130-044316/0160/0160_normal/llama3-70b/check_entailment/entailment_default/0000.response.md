Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input values N, K, and a list A of N integers as described in the problem.
- It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in list A, which is a valid approach to finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
- The code then finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to its square root and prints this maximum divisor.
- The code handles all potential cases by considering all elements in the list A and calculating the maximum divisor accordingly.
- The output hints provided also align with the code logic, confirming the correctness of the code.
