Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values N, K, and a list A of N integers within specified constraints. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in list A. Then, it finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to its square root and prints this maximum divisor. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it operates based on the provided input constraints. **
