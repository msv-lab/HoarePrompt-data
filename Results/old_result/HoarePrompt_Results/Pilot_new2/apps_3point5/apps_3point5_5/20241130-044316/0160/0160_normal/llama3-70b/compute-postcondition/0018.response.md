According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be equal to the square root of `gcd`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the new state should be adjusted as follows:
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i from 1 to N, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, N and K are input integers obtained by splitting the input, gcd is a positive integer, the square root of gcd is an integer, all elements in list A are considered for calculating gcd, max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd // i where gcd is divisible by i, and i squared is not equal to gcd if gcd % i == 0, `i` is incremented by 1.**
