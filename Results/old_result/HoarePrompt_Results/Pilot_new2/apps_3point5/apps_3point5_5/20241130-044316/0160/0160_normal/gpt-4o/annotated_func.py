    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list 'lst'
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts a list of positive integers and calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i and all values in the input are integers.**

    for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1):
        if x % i == 0:
            divisors.add(i)
            divisors.add(x // i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: N, K, A_i, x, i, divisors is a set containing all divisors of x
    return sorted(divisors, reverse=True)
    #The program returns the set of divisors of x sorted in reverse order
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts an integer parameter x and calculates all the divisors of x. It then returns a set of these divisors sorted in reverse order. The function correctly identifies all divisors of x by iterating up to the square root of x and checking for divisibility. However, it seems to be missing a check to handle the case where x is a perfect square, ensuring that the square root is not counted twice.
