Output State: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, A_i is an integer such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i from 1 to N, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, gcd is a positive integer, the square root of gcd is an integer, all elements in list A are considered for calculating gcd, max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and max(max_divisor, i+1) where gcd is divisible by i+1, (i+1) squared is not equal to gcd if gcd % (i+1) == 0, i is incremented by 1, max_divisor is assigned the maximum value between the current max_divisor and (i+1).
- max_divisor is assigned the maximum value between the current max_divisor and i+1
- i is incremented by 1
