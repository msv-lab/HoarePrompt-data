According to the code, in order for the loop to execute, the variable `x` needs to be defined. The loop will run from 1 to the square root of `x` inclusively. So, in this case, for the loop to execute, `x` must be an integer such that `2 <= x <= 500`. Before the loop starts, `divisors` is an empty set, so no adjustments are needed for `divisors`. However, the loop index `i` starts from 1 and goes up to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`, so the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`N` is an integer such that `2 <= N <= 500`, `K` is an integer such that `0 <= K <= 10^9`, `A_i` are integers such that `1 <= A_i <= 10^6` for all `i`, `divisors` is an empty set, `x` is an integer such that `2 <= x <= 500`, `i` starts from 1**.
