Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A and then finds the maximum divisor of the gcd. The program iterates through all possible divisors up to the square root of the gcd to find the maximum divisor that satisfies the conditions. This logic covers all potential cases and meets the requirements of the problem description. Since the program handles all cases correctly, the correctness is **True**.
