Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the logic to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It considers all possible divisors of the sum of A and checks if each divisor satisfies the condition that every element of A is divisible by it after performing the given operations. The program handles all potential cases and outputs the correct result.
