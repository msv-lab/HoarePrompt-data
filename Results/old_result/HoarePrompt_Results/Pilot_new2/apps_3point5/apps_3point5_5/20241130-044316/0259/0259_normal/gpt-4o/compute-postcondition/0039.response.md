The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. The parameter `n` is an integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is an integer representing the maximum wait time allowed, and `bus_routes` is a list of integers representing the wait times for each bus route. The program calculates the route number with the minimum wait time that is less than or equal to the maximum wait time `t`, and returns this route number. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept the number of bus routes, the maximum wait time allowed, and a list of wait times for each bus route, and return the route number with the minimum wait time that is within the maximum wait time.
