According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the buses list. If the list has at least 1 tuple, the loop can execute. At the start, min_time is initialized to positive infinity and ans is initialized to -1. So, for the loop to be executed, the buses list must have at least 1 tuple, i is 0, s and d are the values from the first tuple in the list.
State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer, buses contains at least 1 tuple (s, d), min_time is initialized to positive infinity, ans is initialized to -1, i is 0, s and d are values from the first tuple in the list**
