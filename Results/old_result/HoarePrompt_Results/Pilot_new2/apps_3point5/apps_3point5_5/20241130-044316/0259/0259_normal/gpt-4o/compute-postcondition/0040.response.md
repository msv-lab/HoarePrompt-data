Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. It iterates through the bus routes to calculate the minimum wait time for each route based on the maximum wait time allowed `t`. Then, it returns the route number with the minimum wait time. However, there is a missing edge case where if all routes exceed the maximum wait time, the function should return a specific value to indicate no route meets the criteria. **
