According to the code, the loop can execute n times. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer between 1 and 100. For the loop to execute one more time, n must be increased by 1.
State: **n is a positive integer between 2 and 100, t is a positive integer, buses contains a tuple (s, d) where s and d are integers obtained from splitting the input**
