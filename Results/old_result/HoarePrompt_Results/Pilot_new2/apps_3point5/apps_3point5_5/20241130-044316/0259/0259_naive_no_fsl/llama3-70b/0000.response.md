Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where multiple buses arrive at the same time. The program only considers the time for the first bus of each route and does not account for multiple buses arriving simultaneously. The correct logic should be to find the bus route with the earliest arrival time, taking into consideration multiple buses arriving at the same time. 

For example, consider the input:
```
2 3
3 2
3 2
```
The correct output should be 1, as both buses arrive at the same time and Serval will take the first bus he sees. However, the program will output 2 in this case.
