According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the variables involved. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `n`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `wait_time` are the variables to consider.

If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `min_wait_time` is updated, `chosen_route` is updated, `n` must be greater than the current `i + 1`, and `wait_time` is assigned 0. Otherwise, `min_wait_time` is updated, `chosen_route` is updated, `n` must be greater than the current `i + 1`, and `wait_time` is calculated.

For the next iteration of the loop to execute, the variables should be adjusted as follows:
State: **`min_wait_time` is the updated wait time, `chosen_route` is the route with the updated minimum wait time, `n` must be greater than the current `i + 1`, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated based on the new route calculations, and `wait_time` is either 0 or calculated based on the condition.**
