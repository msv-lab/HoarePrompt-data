#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer.
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
    #The program returns the result of n multiplied by multiplier divided by the greatest common divisor of n and multiplier, where n is a positive integer, k is a non-negative integer, and multiplier is 10 raised to the power of k
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and k, where n is a positive integer and k is a non-negative integer. It calculates the result of n multiplied by 10 raised to the power of k divided by the greatest common divisor of n and 10 raised to the power of k.
