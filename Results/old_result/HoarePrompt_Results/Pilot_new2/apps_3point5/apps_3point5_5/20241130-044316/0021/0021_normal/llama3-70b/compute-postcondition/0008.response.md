Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and `n` in the list, the minimum distance between these positions, and prints the maximum of these two distances along with `n - 1 - min_dist`. The function does not return any value directly but prints the calculated result. The function requires user input for `n` and the list `a` and operates on these values to determine the output.**
