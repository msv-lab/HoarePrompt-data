Output State: **`n` is an input integer; `a` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input using `input().split()`; `min_pos` stores the index of the minimum positive integer in list `a`; `max_pos` stores the index of `n` in list `a`; `dist1` is equal to the absolute difference between 0 and the index of `n` in list `a`; `dist2` is equal to the absolute difference between `n - 1` and the index of `n` in list `a`; `dist3` is equal to the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`; `dist4` is equal to the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`; `max_distance` is assigned the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, `dist4`.
`max_distance` will be printed to the console as the output.**
