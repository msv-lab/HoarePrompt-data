Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It calculates the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and then calculates the distances of these elements from the beginning and end of the array. It then finds the maximum distance and prints it, which is the correct output based on the problem description. The program ensures that the minimum and maximum elements are as far apart as possible by performing only one swap.
