Output State: **After the execution of the if else block, the color is not in window_counts and window_counts[color] is equal to 0. The values of n, m, colors, counts, color_counts, found, i, and color remain unchanged. The condition (all((count == target for (count, target) in zip(sorted(window_counts.values()), counts)))) is still satisfied. found is True. j is incremented by 1 and must remain less than n. color is assigned the value colors[j].**
