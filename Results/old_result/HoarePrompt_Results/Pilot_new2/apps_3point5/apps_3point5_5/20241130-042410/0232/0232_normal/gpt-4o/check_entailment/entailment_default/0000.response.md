Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input and initializes the necessary variables.
- The function `func_1` correctly creates a dictionary `desired_counts` mapping colors to their desired counts.
- It iterates through the list of colors, updating the counts in `current_counts`.
- If the counts of all colors match the desired counts, the function returns 'YES'.
- Otherwise, it returns 'NO'.
- The code handles cases where the count of a color in `current_counts` is still greater than or equal to the desired count.
- It also increments the 'left' index appropriately to check for other possible intervals.
- The output hints describe the functionality of the code accurately and confirm that the code follows the problem description for all potential cases.
