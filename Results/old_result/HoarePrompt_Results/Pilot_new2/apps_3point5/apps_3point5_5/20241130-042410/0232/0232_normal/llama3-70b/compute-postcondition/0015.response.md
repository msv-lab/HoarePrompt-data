Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers obtained from the input split, `colors` still contains at least 1 color, `counts` is a list with mapped integers from the input split. If `color` is not in `color_counts`, then the value associated with `color` in `color_counts` is updated to 0 for the current `color`.***
