Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `m` is an integer obtained from input split, `colors` is a non-empty list of colors, `counts` is a list containing the mapped integers from the input split, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each color in `colors` is a key, and the value is the count of occurrences of that color in the `colors` list, `found` is either True if the condition is met or False if the condition is not met after all iterations of the loop, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` as key and value as 0, `i` is the final value after the loop executes, `color` is the last color in the `colors` list, `color` is equal to colors[j]. After the execution of the if else block, the color is not in `window_counts` and the overall state of the program is as described.***
