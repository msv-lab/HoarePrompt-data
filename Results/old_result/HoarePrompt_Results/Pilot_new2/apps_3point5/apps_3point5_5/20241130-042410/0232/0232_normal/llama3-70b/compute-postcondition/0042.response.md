Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is an integer obtained from input split, `colors` is a non-empty list of colors, `counts` is a list containing the mapped integers from the input split, `color_counts` is a dictionary where each color in `colors` is a key, and the value is the count of occurrences of that color in the `colors` list, `found` is True, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` as key and the count of occurrences of that color in the `colors` list + 3 as its value (incremented by 1), `i` is 1, `j` is 2, and `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 0.***
