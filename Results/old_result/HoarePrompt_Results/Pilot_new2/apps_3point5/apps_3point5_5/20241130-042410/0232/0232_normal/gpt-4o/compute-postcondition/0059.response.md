Output State: **After the loop executes, the count of all colors in `current_counts` is still greater than or equal to the count in `desired_counts` for all colors except one color, where the count is adjusted to not meet the condition. 'YES' is returned if all color counts in `current_counts` match the counts in `desired_counts`. `left` is incremented by 2.**
