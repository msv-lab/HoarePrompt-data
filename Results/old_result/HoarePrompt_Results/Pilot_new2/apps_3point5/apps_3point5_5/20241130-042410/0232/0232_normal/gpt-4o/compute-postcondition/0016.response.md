According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the condition that all current counts of colors should be greater than or equal to their desired counts. At the end of the last iteration, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decreased by 1 and `left` is increased by 1. For the loop to execute one more time, the current count of the color at index `left` should still be greater than or equal to its desired count. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`current_counts[colors[left]]` is still greater than or equal to `desired_counts[colors[left]]`, `left` is increased by 1**
