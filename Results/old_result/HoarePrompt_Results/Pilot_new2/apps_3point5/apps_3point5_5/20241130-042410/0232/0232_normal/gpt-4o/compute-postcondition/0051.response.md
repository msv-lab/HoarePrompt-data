Postcondition: ***The count of all colors in `current_counts` is still greater than or equal to the count in `desired_counts` for all colors except one color, where `current_counts[color]` is adjusted to not meet the condition. `left` is incremented by 1. If all colors in `current_counts` match the counts in `desired_counts`, the program returns 'YES'. Otherwise, no changes are made and there is no return value.***
