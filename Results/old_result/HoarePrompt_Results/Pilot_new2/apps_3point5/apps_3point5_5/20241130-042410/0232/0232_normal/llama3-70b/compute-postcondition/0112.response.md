Postcondition: ***`found` remains True, `window_counts` contains all the color counts encountered during the loop, `i` remains the same starting value, `color` is the last color in the `colors` list, `n` is equal to the final value of the loop range, `color` is in `window_counts`, and the condition (count == target) for (count, target) in zip(sorted(window_counts.values()), counts) is True for all elements at the end of the loop. Additionally, the `found` variable evaluates to True.***
