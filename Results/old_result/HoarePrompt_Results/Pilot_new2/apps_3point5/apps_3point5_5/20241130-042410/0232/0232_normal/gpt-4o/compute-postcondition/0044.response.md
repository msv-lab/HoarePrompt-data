Postcondition: ***The count of all colors in `current_counts` is greater than or equal to the count in `desired_counts` for all colors. `right` is incremented by 1. `current_counts[colors[right]]` should be adjusted to not meet the condition for all colors in `desired_counts`. The current value of `right` is increased by 1 and `current_counts` is adjusted to no longer satisfy the condition where each color count equals the desired count***
