At the end of the last iteration, the count of all colors in `current_counts` should be greater than or equal to the count in `desired_counts` for all colors. The loop control variable `right` will determine the next iteration. To execute the loop one more time, the `right` should be incremented by 1. 

State: **The count of all colors in `current_counts` is greater than or equal to the count in `desired_counts` for all colors, `right` is incremented by 1**
