Output State: **`found` remains True, `window_counts` remains a dictionary with the key `color` and a value of 1, `i` remains the starting value of the range, `color` remains the next color in the `colors` list, `n` remains greater than or equal to `i`, and `color` remains in `window_counts`. All (count == target) for (count, target) in zip(sorted(window_counts.values()), counts) remains True. The code breaks out of the loop or if statement it is in.**
