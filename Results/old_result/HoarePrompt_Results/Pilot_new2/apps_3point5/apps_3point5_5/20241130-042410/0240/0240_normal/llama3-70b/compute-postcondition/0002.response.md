According to the code, the loop will execute over each character in the string `s`. Since `s` is a string representing the number received by Kate, it implies that `s` will have at least 1 character. Therefore, the loop will execute if `s` is not an empty string. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **`s` is a string representing the number received by Kate and is not empty, `t` is a substring of `s` with leading zeroes, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`, `n` is an empty string**
