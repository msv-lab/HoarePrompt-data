The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, a string representing the number received by Kate, and `t`, a substring of `s`. Both `s` and `t` can contain leading zeroes. After executing the function body, the program returns the integer value of string 'n', which contains all characters of string 's' that are also in the unique characters of substring 't', followed by the substring 't' with leading zeroes. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two strings `s` and `t`, and return an integer value of a new string 'n' containing characters from 's' that are also in unique characters of 't', followed by 't' with leading zeroes. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two string parameters s and t. It returns an integer value of string 'n' containing characters from 's' that are present in the unique characters of 't', followed by 't' with leading zeroes.**
