Functionality: ** The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars`, a non-empty string representing a very large integer, and `sub`, a substring of `chars`. It generates permutations of `chars` and yields candidate numbers. If a candidate number passes the validity check with the `is_valid_number` function, it is yielded. The function does not return a specific output, but generates and yields valid candidate numbers. If the loop does not execute, the candidate will be an empty string.**
