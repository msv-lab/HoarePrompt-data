Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, `candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of `sub`. If `candidate` is a valid number based on the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, then the program retains the initial state.***
