Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes an integer input `n`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, it calculates a result. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is `n` minus the remainder; otherwise, the result is `n` plus the difference between 10 and the remainder. This logic satisfies the problem description for all potential cases. The rounding is done correctly as described, and the code provides the expected output for all given examples.
