Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly rounds the given number to the nearest integer that ends with 0 as described in the problem statement. It checks if the last digit of the number is already 0, in which case it prints the number as is. Otherwise, it calculates the nearest integer by subtracting or adding based on the last digit of the number. The logic covers all possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output.
