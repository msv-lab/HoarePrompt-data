Functionality: ** The function prompts the user to input a non-negative integer `n` between 0 and 10^9. If n is divisible by 10, it prints n. If n is not divisible by 10, it adjusts n based on whether n % 10 is less than or equal to 5 or greater than 5, and then prints the adjusted value. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
