Postcondition: ***x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. x is not greater than y + z is true. x is not less than y, x is greater than or equal to y, x is not greater than y + z. If x == y, then in the if part, if z == 0, then z remains 0. If z != 0, then z is updated to a non-zero value. In the else part, where x is not equal to y, the program's state is not altered.***
