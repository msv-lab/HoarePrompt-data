Correctness: **True**

The program follows the problem description accurately. It correctly reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z. It then compares these values according to the conditions specified:
- If x is greater than y + z, it prints '+'
- If x is less than y, it prints '-'
- If x is equal to y and z is 0, it prints '0'
- If x is equal to y and z is not 0, it prints '?'

The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem description and provides the correct output for each scenario. Therefore, the program is correct.
