Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly checks if a given string is "s-palindrome" by iterating through the string and comparing characters from the beginning and the end of the string. If the characters do not match, the program sets `is_spalindrome` to False and breaks out of the loop. The program then prints "TAK" if `is_spalindrome` is True, indicating that the string is indeed symmetric about the middle, and "NIE" otherwise. 

The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and for all potential cases, the program correctly identifies whether a string is "s-palindrome" or not. Therefore, the correctness of the program is true.
