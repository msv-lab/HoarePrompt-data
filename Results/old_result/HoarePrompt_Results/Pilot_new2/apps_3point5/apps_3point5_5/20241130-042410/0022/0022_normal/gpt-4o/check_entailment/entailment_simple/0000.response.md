Correctness: **True**

The program is correct as it correctly checks if the given string is a symmetric palindrome around the middle. It iterates through the first half of the string and compares each character with its corresponding character in the second half of the string. If at any point, the characters do not match, it returns False. Otherwise, if the loop completes without finding any non-matching characters, it returns True. This aligns with the problem description and accurately determines if a string is an "s-palindrome".
