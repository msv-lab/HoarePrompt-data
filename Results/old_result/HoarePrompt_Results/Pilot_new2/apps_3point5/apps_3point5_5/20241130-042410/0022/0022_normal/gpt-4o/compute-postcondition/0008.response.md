At the end of the last iteration, s is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, n is at least 4, i is 1. Since the loop iterates until i reaches n//2, for the loop to execute one more time, i needs to be incremented by 1. Therefore, the next iteration would have i as 2.
State: **s is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, n is at least 4, i is 2**
