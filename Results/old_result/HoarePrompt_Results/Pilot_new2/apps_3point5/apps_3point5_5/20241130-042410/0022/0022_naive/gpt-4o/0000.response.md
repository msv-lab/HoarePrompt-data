Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly checks if the given string is "s-palindrome" by iterating over the first half of the string and comparing each character with its corresponding character from the second half. If at any point, the characters do not match, the program returns False indicating that the string is not "s-palindrome". If all characters match, the program returns True indicating that the string is "s-palindrome". The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description provided. 

Additionally, the program handles all potential cases where the string may or may not be "s-palindrome" by considering the symmetry of the string around its middle.
