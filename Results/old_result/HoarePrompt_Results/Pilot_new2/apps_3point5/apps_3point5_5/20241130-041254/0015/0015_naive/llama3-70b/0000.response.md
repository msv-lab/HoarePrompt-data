Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If c is equal to 0, then the sequence will consist of elements where each element is equal to a, since the difference between neighboring elements is 0. In this case, if a is equal to b, then b will definitely appear in the sequence, hence the output will be "YES". If a is not equal to b, then b will not appear in the sequence, and the output will be "NO". This is correctly handled in the program.
2. If c is not equal to 0, then the sequence will be of the form a, a+c, a+2c, a+3c, ... . In this case, if there exists an element in the sequence which is equal to b, the difference between b and a must be a multiple of c and b must be greater than or equal to a. This condition is correctly checked in the program.
