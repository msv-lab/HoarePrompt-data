Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It checks if `b` appears in the sequence generated starting from `a` with a difference of `c` between neighboring elements. It prints "YES" if `b` is part of the sequence and "NO" otherwise. The program handles the case where `c` is 0 separately, checking if `a` is equal to `b`.

The if-else blocks in the program cover all possible cases as described in the problem description, ensuring that the correct output is generated for each scenario. Therefore, the program is correct.
