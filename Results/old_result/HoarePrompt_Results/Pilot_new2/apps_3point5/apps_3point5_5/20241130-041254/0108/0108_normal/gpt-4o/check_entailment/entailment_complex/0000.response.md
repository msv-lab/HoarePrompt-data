Correctness: **True**

The program reads a string input `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and compares it with the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. It iterates through `s` and 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' character by character, checking if each character in `s` matches the corresponding character in the target string. If all characters in `s` match the corresponding characters in the target string, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If there is no match, it prints -1.

The program fulfills the requirements of the problem description by checking if it is possible to obtain a string from the given input `s` that contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. If such a string can be obtained, it prints the string, otherwise it prints -1.
