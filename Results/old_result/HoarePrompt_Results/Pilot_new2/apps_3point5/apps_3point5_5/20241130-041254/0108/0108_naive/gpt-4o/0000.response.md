Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly reads the input string `s`, then iterates through both the input string `s` and the target string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'` to check if the characters match. If all characters in the target string are found in the input string in the correct order, the program prints out the target string. Otherwise, it prints `-1`. This logic ensures that the output string contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected according to the problem description.
