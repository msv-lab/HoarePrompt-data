Correctness: **True**

The program reads a string `s` and then iterates over it to check if it contains the English alphabet in order as a subsequence. If it does, it prints the string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", which means it was possible to obtain the English alphabet as a subsequence. If not, it prints -1.

The program follows the problem description as it checks if the input string can be transformed to contain the English alphabet as a subsequence by replacing characters in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order. It correctly prints the transformed string or -1 if it is not possible.
