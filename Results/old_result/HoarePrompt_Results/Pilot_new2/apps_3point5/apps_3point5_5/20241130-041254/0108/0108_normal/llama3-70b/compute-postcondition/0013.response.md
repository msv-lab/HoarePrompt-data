The loop will continue to execute as long as the next character `char` is present in the string `s`. The loop replaces one occurrence of the character `char` with the next character in the alphabet and adds the original `char` to the result `res`.

Output State: **`s` has no occurrence of any character from the initial `alphabet`, `alphabet` is empty, `res` contains all the characters processed so far, `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string, loop control variable `char` is not found in the string `s`.**
