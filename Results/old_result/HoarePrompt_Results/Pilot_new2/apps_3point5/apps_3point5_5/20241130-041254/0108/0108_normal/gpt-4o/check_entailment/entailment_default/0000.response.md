Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads a string `s` input consisting of lowercase English letters and compares it with the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. It iterates through `s` and 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' character by character, and if all characters in `s` match the corresponding characters in the target string, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If there is no match, it prints -1. The code meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases. The output hints also agree with the code in terms of functionality and the cases described. Thus, the code is correct.
