According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`, as well as the lengths of `s` and `target`. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions were as follows: `i` must be less than the length of `s`, `j` must be less than 26. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` should be less than the length of `s` by at least 1.
- `j` should be less than 26 by at least 1.

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` must be less than the length of `s` by at least 1, and `j` must be less than 26 by at least 1**
