According to the code, the loop will iterate through each character in the `alphabet` string. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has no occurrence of any character from the initial `alphabet`, `alphabet` is empty, `res` contains all the characters processed so far plus the values of all characters in `alphabet`, `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string, loop control variable `char` is not found in the string `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the `alphabet` should be processed by the loop. Therefore, the next character `char` should be considered in the `alphabet` string.

State: **`s` has no occurrence of any character from the initial `alphabet`, `alphabet` is empty, `res` contains all the characters processed so far plus the values of all characters in `alphabet`, `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string, loop control variable `char` is not found in the string `s`, the next character in the `alphabet` string should be considered**
