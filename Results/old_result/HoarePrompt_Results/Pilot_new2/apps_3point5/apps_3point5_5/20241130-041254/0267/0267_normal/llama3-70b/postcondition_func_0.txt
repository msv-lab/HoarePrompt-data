The function func_1 accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. It calculates the count of numbers divisible by `k` in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) and subtracts the count of numbers divisible by `k` in the range from 1 to `l-1` (inclusive). The result is then returned modulo MOD.
