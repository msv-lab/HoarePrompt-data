Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The function utilizes dynamic programming to efficiently calculate the count of numbers with at most $k$ different digits in the given range.

The function `count` within `func_1` correctly implements the counting logic based on the number of different digits allowed. The main function calculates the final sum modulo $998244353$ and returns the result.

The input is correctly taken from the user, passed to the `func_1` function, and the output is printed as expected. The program handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for the given examples. Hence, the program is correct for all potential cases.
