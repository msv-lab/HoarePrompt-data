According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l`, `r`, `k`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)`. If `num` is within the range of `l` and `r`, and `func_1(num, k)` is true, the loop can execute again.

At the end of the last iteration, `l`, `r`, and `k` satisfy the given conditions. If `func_1(num, k)` is true for the current `num`, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.

To execute the loop one more time, the next `num` within the range of `l` and `r` must be considered. Additionally, the conditions for `k` and for `func_1(num, k)` to be true must still hold.

State: **`l`, `r`, `k` are integers satisfying the given conditions. If `func_1(num, k)` is true where `num` meets the condition with `k`, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. Next `num` in the range `(l, r + 1)` should be considered.**
