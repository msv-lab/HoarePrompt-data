According to the code, the loop can execute if the range from l to r inclusive has at least 1 number. Therefore, for the loop to execute, l must be less than or equal to r. Additionally, the loop depends on the variable k which must be between 1 and 10. Before the loop starts, total_sum is 0. 
State: **l is an integer such that 1 <= l, r is an integer such that l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, total_sum is 0**
