Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The code does not handle the case when the maximum number of different digits `k` is equal to 1. This is a potential case that the code does not cover as per the problem description. 
- If `k = 1`, then the code should calculate all numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number is formed using only one digit. However, the current implementation of the code does not handle this scenario.
- Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness of the code as **False**.
