Correctness: **True**

The annotated program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. The program uses dynamic programming to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The program calculates this sum by counting the numbers divisible by $k$ in the given ranges and then taking the difference between the counts.

The program first defines a recursive function `count` to calculate the count of numbers divisible by $k$ up to a given number $n$. This function uses memoization to store previously computed values to improve efficiency.

The main function `func_1` then calculates the required sum by calling the `count` function for the range $l$ to $r$ and subtracting the count for the range $1$ to $l-1$.

Overall, the program follows the problem description and correctly calculates the sum of numbers with at most $k$ different digits in the given range, modulo $998244353$.
