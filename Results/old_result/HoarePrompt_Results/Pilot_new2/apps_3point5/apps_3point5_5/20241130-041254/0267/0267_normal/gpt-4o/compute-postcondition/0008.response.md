According to the code, the loop will execute for each `num` in the range `(l, r + 1)`. At the end of the last iteration, `l`, `r`, and `k` are integers satisfying the given conditions. If `func_1(num, k)` is true where `num` meets the condition with `k`, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next `num` in the range `(l, r + 1)` should be considered. Since the loop is iterating over a range from `l` to `r + 1`, the next `num` would be the next integer after the current `num`.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time is:
State: **`l`, `r`, and `k` remain the same, the next `num` in the range `(l, r + 1)` should be considered for the next iteration**
