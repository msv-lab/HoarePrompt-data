#State of the program right berfore the function call: **n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, 1 <= k <= 10.**
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns True if the number of unique digits in the integer n is less than or equal to k, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function accepts two integers n and k, and it returns True if the number of unique digits in n is less than or equal to k. Otherwise, it returns False. The program assumes that n and k are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, 1 <= k <= 10.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.**

    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, `l`, `r`, `k` remain unchanged. If `func_1(num, k)` is true for all numbers `num` in the range `(l, r + 1)`, then `total_sum` is updated to the sum of all such numbers modulo `MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` is false for any number, then `total_sum` remains 0.
    return total_sum
    #The program returns the updated total sum (modulo MOD) based on the conditions of func_1(num, k) for all numbers in the range (l, r + 1) or 0 if func_1(num, k) is false for any number.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_2 accepts three integers l, r, and k within specified constraints. It iterates over all numbers in the range (l, r + 1), calling func_1(num, k) for each number. If func_1(num, k) returns true for all numbers, it updates the total sum by adding each number and taking the result modulo MOD. If func_1(num, k) returns false for any number, the total sum remains 0. The function then returns the updated total sum if all conditions are met, or 0 if any number fails the func_1 check.
