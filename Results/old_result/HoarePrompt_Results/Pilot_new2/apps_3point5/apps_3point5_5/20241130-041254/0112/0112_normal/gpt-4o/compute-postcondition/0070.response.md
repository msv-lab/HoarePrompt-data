The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number that Masha can make using her cubes. 

The function has multiple return cases:
1. If none of the elements in `used_cubes` that correspond to a cube face containing the first digit in the list of digits are set to True, and 'found' remains False, the function returns False.
2. The program returns False.
3. The program returns False and sets the 'found' variable to False, while leaving all other variables unchanged.
4. The program returns True after the loop where 'found' is set to True, 'used_cubes' is a list with all elements being True, 'i' is equal to n-1, and there are no more digits left in the 'digits' list.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to determine if Masha can form the number 'num' using her cubes, based on the conditions mentioned in the different return cases.
