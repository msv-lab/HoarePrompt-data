Postcondition: ***num is a non-negative integer representing the maximum number that Masha can make using her cubes, digits is a list containing the individual digits of num that is not empty, used_cubes is a list of n elements with the current value at index i set to True, digit is the first digit in the list of digits, found is True, n must be greater than 1, i is 2, used_cubes[i] is set to True, and the loop can execute another iteration after updating the values of i, n, and used_cubes[i]. If not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i], the loop breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
