According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`, as well as the conditions related to `used_cubes`, `digits`, and `cube_faces`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `found` is True, `used_cubes` is a list where elements at index other than i are True and `used_cubes[i]` is True, `i` is 1, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, there are more digits left in the `digits` list.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be increased by 1, so it becomes 2.
- `n` must still be greater than or equal to 2 for the loop to execute.
- The condition related to `used_cubes[i]` needs to be considered. If `used_cubes[2]` is False and the digit is in `cube_faces[2]`, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.

State: **`found` is True, `used_cubes` is a list where elements at index other than 2 are True and `used_cubes[2]` is True, `i` is 2, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2, there are more digits left in the `digits` list, the conditions related to breaking out of the loop are met**
