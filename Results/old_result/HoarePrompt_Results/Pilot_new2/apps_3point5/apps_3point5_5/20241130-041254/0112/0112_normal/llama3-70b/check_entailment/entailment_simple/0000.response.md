Correctness: **True**

The program reads the input, collects all the digits from the cubes (excluding '0'), sorts them in descending order, and then forms the maximum number that can be created using those digits. This aligns with the problem description of finding the largest natural number x that can be formed using the cubes.

Additionally, the program correctly handles the case where there are cubes with digit '0' by removing '0' from the set of digits before forming the maximum number.

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
