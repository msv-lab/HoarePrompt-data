Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean that indicates whether a pair of elements `x` and `y` exists in the `assigned` list such that `a[i] = x + y`. If `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1 and `i` is increased by 1. The loop continues until the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is true for any pair, at which point the loop exits.***
