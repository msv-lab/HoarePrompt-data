The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer in the range [1, 23], and `a`, which is a list of distinct positive integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9]. After executing the function, it returns the number of times the condition was not met during the loop execution. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `a`, and return the number of times the condition was not met during the loop execution.
