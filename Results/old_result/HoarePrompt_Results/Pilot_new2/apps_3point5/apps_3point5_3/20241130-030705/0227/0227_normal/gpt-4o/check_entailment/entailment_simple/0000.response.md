Correctness: **True**

The program correctly determines the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the described sequence of operations. It iterates through the list of integers `a`, and for each integer `a[i]`, it checks if there exists a pair of elements in the set `assigned` such that their difference equals `a[i]`. If such a pair exists, it sets `can_form` to True, if not, it increments the variable `m`. This process ensures that the variables can help perform the described sequence of operations as required by the problem description. 

The program correctly handles the case where it cannot perform the sequence of operations by returning -1. 

Therefore, the program is correct as it follows the problem description for all potential cases.
