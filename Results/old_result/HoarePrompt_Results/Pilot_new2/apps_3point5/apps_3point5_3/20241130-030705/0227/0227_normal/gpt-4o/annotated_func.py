#State of the program right berfore the function call: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23) and a is a list of distinct positive integers where each integer is in the range [1, 10^9].**
def func_1(n, a):
    a.sort()
    assigned = set()
    assigned.add(a[0])
    m = 1
    for i in range(1, n):
        can_form = False
        
        for x in assigned:
            if a[i] - x in assigned:
                can_form = True
                break
        
        if not can_form:
            m += 1
        
        assigned.add(a[i])
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `can_form` is True if there exists a pair of elements in list `a` such that their difference is also in list `a`, otherwise `can_form` remains False. If `can_form` is not True, `assigned` contains all elements of list `a` and `m` is equal to the number of times the condition was not met during the loop execution.
    return m
    #The program returns the number of times the condition was not met during the loop execution
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` takes a positive integer `n` in the range [1, 23] and a list `a` of distinct positive integers. It then sorts the list `a`, iterates through the elements to check if a pair exists where their difference is also in the list, and increments a counter `m` for each pair that doesn't meet the condition. Finally, it returns the total count of pairs that didn't meet the condition.
