According to the code, in order for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 1. 
Before the loop starts, `a` being a sorted list of integers does not affect the loop execution, and `m` being 1 also does not impact the loop. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is now 1. 
State: **`n` must be greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 1, `i` is 1**
