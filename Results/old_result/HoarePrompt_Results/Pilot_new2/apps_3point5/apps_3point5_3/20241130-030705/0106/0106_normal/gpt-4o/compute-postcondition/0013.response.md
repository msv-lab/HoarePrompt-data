The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 

Where **Precondition**: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k.

The program returns the total time required for an item to move from `block_a` and `floor_a` to `block_b` and `floor_b` based on the given conditions.
