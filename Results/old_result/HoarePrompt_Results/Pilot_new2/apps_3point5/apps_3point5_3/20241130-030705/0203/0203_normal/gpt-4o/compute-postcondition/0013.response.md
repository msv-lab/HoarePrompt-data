Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `employees` belong to either 'D' or 'R', `votes` is a string with at least 1 character. If the next character in `votes` is 'D', `d_queue` contains the value `i`, `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is the index of the next character. If the next character in `votes` is not 'D', `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` contains the value 0 and the previous values with the index `i` appended to it, `i` is the index of the next character.***
