According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` string. If the string has at least 1 fraction, the loop will execute. 

For the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `n` must be a positive integer
- `fractions` must be a string with at least one fraction
- `republicans` should be set to 0
- `remocrats` should be set to 0

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string with at least one fraction, `republicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
