According to the code, the loop can execute again depending on the `fractions` string. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string with at least one fraction, `republicans` and `remocrats` are both integers. If the last fraction processed was 'D', then `fraction` is 'D' and `republicans` has been increased by 1. If the last fraction processed was not 'D', then `remocrats` has been increased by 1. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next fraction in the string should be processed. If that fraction is 'D', then `republicans` should be increased by 1, otherwise `remocrats` should be increased by 1.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string with at least one more fraction, new `republicans` and `remocrats` values**
