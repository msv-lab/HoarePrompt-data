Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the number of employees and their political affiliations correctly.
- It then counts the number of depublicans and remocrats accurately.
- Finally, it determines the outcome of the vote based on the counts provided in the description.
- The code handles the scenario where one party has a majority over the other.
- The output is either 'D' if depublicans win or 'R' if remocrats win, as expected.
- There are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or output hints that the code does not handle correctly.
