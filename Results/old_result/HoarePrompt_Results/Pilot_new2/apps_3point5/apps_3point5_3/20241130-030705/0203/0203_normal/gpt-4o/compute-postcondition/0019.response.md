According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. 

Right before the loop, it is given that `votes` is a string with at least 1 character, which means both `d_queue` and `r_queue` cannot be empty. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **No adjustments needed, loop will execute**
