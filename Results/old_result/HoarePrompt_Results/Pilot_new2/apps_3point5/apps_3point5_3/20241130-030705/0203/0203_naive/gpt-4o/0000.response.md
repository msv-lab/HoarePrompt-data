Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly simulates the voting process as described in the problem statement. It maintains two queues, one for depublicans and one for remocrats, and iterates through the votes according to the order specified. The program correctly handles the scenarios where an employee denies someone else the right to vote and skips their turn if they are denied. The program then determines the outcome based on the remaining queues of eligible voters. 

For all possible inputs, the program follows the rules of the voting process described in the problem statement and produces the correct outcome. Hence, the program is correct.
