The loop iterates as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are non-empty. Each iteration, it pops the first element from both queues and adjusts the queues based on the comparison of the popped elements.

Output State: **After all iterations of the loop, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will be empty depending on the initial configuration of `votes`. The `d_queue` will contain the indices of 'D' characters that were processed, and the `r_queue` will contain the indices of 'R' characters that were processed. The values of `d_index` and `r_index` will be the last popped values from the respective queues.**
