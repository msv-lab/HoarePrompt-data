Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It maintains two queues, one for depublicans and one for remocrats, and simulates the voting process based on the order in which employees make their statements. The program iterates through the queues, denying the right to vote to the employee with a lower index until only one queue is left. The final output is based on the remaining queue, 'D' for depublicans and 'R' for remocrats. The code handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct outcome for each case.
