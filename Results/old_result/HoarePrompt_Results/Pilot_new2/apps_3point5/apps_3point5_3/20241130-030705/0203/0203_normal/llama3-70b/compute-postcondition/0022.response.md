Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string with at least one fraction, `republicans` is equal to the count of 'D' fractions, `remocrats` is equal to the count of non-'D' fractions. If all fractions are 'D', `republicans` will be equal to the total number of fractions. If all fractions are not 'D', `remocrats` will be equal to the total number of fractions. If (republicans <= remocrats), then the program variables remain unchanged. The code snippet prints 'R' to the output.**
