Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are integers satisfying the constraint 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. The function calculates the remainder of dividing `n` by each integer from 1 to `k` and checks if there are any repeated remainders. If there are repeated remainders, it returns 'No'. If all unique remainders are stored in `seen_remainders` without repetitions, it returns 'Yes'. The function covers the cases where the program returns 'No' for multiple potential cases as annotated, and returns 'Yes' if the condition for unique remainders is met.**
