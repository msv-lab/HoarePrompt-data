Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, `k` is less than `n`, `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainder of dividing `n` by each `i` from 1 to `k`, and `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `k`. If any remainder from 1 to `k` is repeated, the loop returns 'No'. Otherwise, all unique remainders are stored in `seen_remainders`.**
