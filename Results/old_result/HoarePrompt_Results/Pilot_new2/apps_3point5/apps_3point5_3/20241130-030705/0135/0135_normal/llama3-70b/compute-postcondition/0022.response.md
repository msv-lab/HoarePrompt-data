Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen` is a set containing unique values of `n` modulo `i` where 1 ≤ `i` ≤ `k`; `remainder` is equal to `n` modulo `i` for the last iteration; if `remainder` is already in `seen`, the program would have printed 'No' and exited during that iteration. The output state after running the code is 'Yes'.**
