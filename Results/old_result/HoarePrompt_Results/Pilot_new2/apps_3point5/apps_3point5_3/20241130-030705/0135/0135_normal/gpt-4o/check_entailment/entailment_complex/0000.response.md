Correctness: **True**

The annotated program provided correctly implements the logic as described in the problem description. It computes the remainder of dividing `n` by each integer from 1 to `k`, and checks if all these remainders are distinct. If there are any repeated remainders, it returns 'No', otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The program considers all possible cases and handles them appropriately, ensuring that the output matches the expected output based on the problem description.
