Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly determines whether all remainders are distinct by using a set to keep track of seen remainders. It iterates through all integers from 1 to k and checks if the remainder is already in the set. If it is, then it prints "No" and exits. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set. If the program passes all test cases provided in the problem description, then it is correct as it covers all possible scenarios.
