Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the input values of n and k, then iterates through all integers from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n divided by i, and checks if that remainder has been seen before. If a remainder has been seen before, it prints "No" and exits the program. If all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes" at the end. The logic of the program seems to correctly follow the problem description for all potential cases.
