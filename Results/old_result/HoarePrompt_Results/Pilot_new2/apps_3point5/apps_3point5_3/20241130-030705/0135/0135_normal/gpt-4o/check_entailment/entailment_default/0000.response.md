Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly defines the function `func_1` that takes two integer parameters `n` and `k`.
- It checks if the value of `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, returning 'No' in this case.
- It initializes an empty set `seen_remainders` to store unique remainders.
- It then iterates through a range from 1 to `k+1` and calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`.
- If the remainder is already in `seen_remainders`, it returns 'No' immediately.
- If no repeated remainders are found, it adds the remainder to `seen_remainders` and continues the loop.
- Finally, if all remainders are unique, it returns 'Yes' as expected based on the problem description.

The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints agree with the code's logic, confirming that the code is correct.
