Postcondition: ***T, n, x are integers obtained from splitting the input, s is a string obtained from input, cnt0 is the count of '0's in the string s, cnt1 is the count of '1's in the string s, balance is equal to cnt0 - cnt1. If balance == x, then x is equal to balance + 1 and n is incremented by 1. If balance is not equal to x and ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) == 0, the function executes the if part. Otherwise, the function executes the else part where the value printed equals ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1).***
