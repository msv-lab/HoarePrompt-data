Postcondition: ***T is an integer input with T greater than or equal to 1, n and x are integers obtained from splitting the input, s is a string obtained from input, cnt0 is the count of '0's in the string s, cnt1 is the count of '1's in the string s, balance is equal to cnt0 - cnt1 and balance is not equal to x. The expression ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is not equal to 0***
