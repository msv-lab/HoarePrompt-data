According to the code, the loop will execute T number of times. So, for the loop to execute, the following states need to be adjusted:
- T is assigned the first integer value from the `data` list
- n is a positive integer
- x is an integer such that -10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9
- s is a binary string of length n
- `data` is a list containing the input values and is not empty
- `index` is assigned the value 1
- `results` is an empty list before the loop starts

State: **$T$ is assigned the first integer value from the `data` list, $n$ is a positive integer, $x$ is an integer such that $-10^9 \le x \le 10^9, $s$ is a binary string of length $n$, `data` is a list containing the input values and is not empty, `index` is assigned the value 1, `results` is an empty list**
