Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints agree with the code, but there is a case where the code does not handle the scenario correctly. 

For example, for the test case "2 0" with string "01", the correct output should be -1 because there are an infinite number of prefixes with balance equal to 0. However, the code outputs "0" which is incorrect. This shows that the code does not handle the case of an infinite number of prefixes correctly, leading to an incorrect result.
