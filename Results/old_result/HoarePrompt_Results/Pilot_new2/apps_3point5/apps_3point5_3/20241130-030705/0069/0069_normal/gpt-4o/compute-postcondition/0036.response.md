Postcondition: ***`count` is 3, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 3 elements, `b` is the third element in the list, `x` is an integer, `balance` is a positive integer. If (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0, then `count` is updated to 3, and the list `prefix_balances` remains the same. The integer `b` remains unchanged, `x` is an integer, and `balance` is a positive integer.***
