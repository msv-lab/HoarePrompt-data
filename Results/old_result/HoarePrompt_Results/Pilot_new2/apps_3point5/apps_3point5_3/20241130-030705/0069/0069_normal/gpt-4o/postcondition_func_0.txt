The function `func_1` reads input data consisting of a positive integer $T$, followed by $T$ sets of data containing a positive integer $n$, an integer $x$, and a binary string $s$ of length $n$. It then processes each set of data to calculate certain conditions based on the input values. After processing all sets, it prints the results. The function does not explicitly return a value, but it performs calculations and prints results based on the input data.
