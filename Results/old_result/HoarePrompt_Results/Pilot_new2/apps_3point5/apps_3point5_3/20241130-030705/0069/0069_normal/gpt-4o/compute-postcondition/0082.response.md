According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`T` is now $T-1`, `n` is incremented by 1 and assigned the value of `data[8]`, `x` is an integer value obtained from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, `prefix_balances` is now a list of zeros with length equal to `n + 1`**
