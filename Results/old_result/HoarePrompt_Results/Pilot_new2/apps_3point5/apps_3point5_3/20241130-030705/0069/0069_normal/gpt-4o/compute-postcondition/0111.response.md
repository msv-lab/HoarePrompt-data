According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 1 result, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, the required states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **$T$ remains the first integer value from the `data` list, `n` will be the total number of iterations of the loop, `x` will be assigned the last integer value from the `data` list, `s` will be assigned the last binary string value from the `data` list, `data` will remain a list containing all input values, `index` will be the last index value after the loop finishes, `balance` will be the final difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the last binary string `s`, `prefix_balances` will be a list of length `n + 1` where `prefix_balances[i]` will be calculated based on the last binary string value `s`, if `balance` is equal to 0 at the end, `results` will contain -1 if the last integer `x` is in the `prefix_balances` list, otherwise, `results` will contain 0, if `balance` is not equal to 0 at the end, `count` will be the final count of the number of times the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0` is satisfied for all elements in the `prefix_balances` list and this value will be appended to the `results` list**.
