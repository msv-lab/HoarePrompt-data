Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values converted to integers and split by space, `pos1` is the index of the integer 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of the input integer `n` in list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum value between the absolute difference of `pos1 - posn` subtracted by 1 and `n - 2`, `min_dist` is the minimum value between the absolute difference of `pos1 - posn` subtracted by 1 and `n - 2`. The code calculates the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist` and prints it.**
