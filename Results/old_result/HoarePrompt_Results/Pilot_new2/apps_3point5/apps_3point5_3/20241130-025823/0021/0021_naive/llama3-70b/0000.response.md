Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input n and the list of distinct integers a from the user.
2. It correctly finds the position of the minimum element 1 and the maximum element n in the list a.
3. It calculates the maximum possible distance by considering the positions of 1 and n and the position of the other element between them.
4. Finally, it prints the maximum possible distance as required.

The program seems to cover all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the problem description.
