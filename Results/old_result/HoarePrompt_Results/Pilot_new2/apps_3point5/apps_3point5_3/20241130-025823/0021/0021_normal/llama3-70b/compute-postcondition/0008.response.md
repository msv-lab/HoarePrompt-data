Functionality: **The function reads an integer input n, followed by a list of integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in the list, the minimum distance between the positions of 1 and n in the list, and prints the maximum of the two distances along with n - 1. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return anything.**
