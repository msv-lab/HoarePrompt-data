#State of the program right berfore the function call: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.**
def func_1(n, k):
    multiplier = 10 ** k
    x = n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))
    return x
    #The program returns the value of x, which is the result of n multiplied by 10 raised to the power of k divided by the greatest common divisor of n and 10 raised to the power of k
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two positive integers n and k. It calculates the value of x by multiplying n with 10 raised to the power of k divided by the greatest common divisor of n and 10 raised to the power of k. The function then returns the calculated value of x. It is important to note that the function assumes valid input for n and k, where n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and k is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8.
