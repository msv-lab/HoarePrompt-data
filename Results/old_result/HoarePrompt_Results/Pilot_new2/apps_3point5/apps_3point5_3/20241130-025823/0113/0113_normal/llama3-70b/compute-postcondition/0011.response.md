Functionality: ** The function `func` reads input values for `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer within specified constraints. It then increments `n` until it becomes a multiple of 10 to the power of `k`. Finally, it prints the updated value of `n`. The function does not explicitly return any value. It ensures that `n` satisfies the condition of being a multiple of 10 to the power of `k`.**
