According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the value of `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A_i` are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set containing the value of i that was added by the code execution, and divisors now contains x // i for all i where x is divisible by i. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Increment the value of `i` by 1.
- Check if the square root of `x` is greater than the new value of `i`.

State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, divisors is a set containing the value of i that was added by the code execution, and divisors now contains x // i for all i where x is divisible by i. `i` is increased by 1 and `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`.**
