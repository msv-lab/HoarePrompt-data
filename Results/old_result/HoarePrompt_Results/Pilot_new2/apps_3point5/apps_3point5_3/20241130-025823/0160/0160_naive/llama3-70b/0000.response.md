Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes input N, K, and the list of integers A.
2. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all the integers in A.
3. It then iterates up to the square root of the gcd to find all possible divisors of the gcd.
4. It updates the max_divisor to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A.
5. Finally, it prints the max_divisor which is the correct output as per the problem description.
6. The program handles all potential cases and correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
