Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the input values, calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in the list A, and then finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to the square root of the gcd. This maximum divisor is then printed, which is the expected output based on the problem description.

The program follows the problem description for all potential cases because it correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It considers all possible pairs of i and j to achieve this result. Therefore, the program is correct.
