Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A. Then, it iterates up to the square root of the gcd to check for all possible divisors. The program ensures that the maximum divisor is updated and returned correctly. The logic in the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases.
