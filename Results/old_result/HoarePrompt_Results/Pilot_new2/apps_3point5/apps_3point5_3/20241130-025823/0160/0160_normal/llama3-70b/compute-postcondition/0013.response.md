Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, A is a list of integers based on the input split, gcd is equal to the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list A, max_divisor is equal to the maximum value between the previous max_divisor and i, and int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1 is greater than or equal to 1. The current value of gcd % i is 0.**
