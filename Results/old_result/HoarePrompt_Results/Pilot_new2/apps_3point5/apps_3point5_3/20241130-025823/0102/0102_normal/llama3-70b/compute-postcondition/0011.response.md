Postcondition: ***`ones` is a list of strings from empty string to 'nine' representing the numbers from 0 to 9; `teens` is a list of strings representing the numbers from 10 to 19; `tens` is a list of strings representing the tens place values from empty string to 'ninety'; `s` is an input integer. s is greater than or equal to 10. If s < 20, the output string is the string at index s - 10 in the `teens` list. If s is 20 or greater, the output string is the concatenation of the string at index s//10 in the `tens` list and the string at index s%10 in the `ones` list, separated by a hyphen if the ones place value is not 0.***
