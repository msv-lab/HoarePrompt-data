Correctness: **True**

The annotated program defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` as input and returns the string representation of that number based on the conditions specified in the problem description. The program correctly handles the cases where `n` is between 0 and 9, 11 and 19, and 10 and 99. It utilizes lists of string representations of numbers for each case and concatenates them with hyphens as required. 

Therefore, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and is correct.
