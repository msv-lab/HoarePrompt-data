Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that correctly converts a given integer score to its corresponding English words as described in the problem statement. The function handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description, including single-digit numbers, numbers from 11 to 19, and numbers from 20 to 99. The logic used in the program aligns with the rules specified for converting integers to English words. 

Given the constraints of the problem (0 ≤ s ≤ 99), the program covers all possible scenarios and provides the correct output for each case. Therefore, the program is correct.
