Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `func_1` that takes an integer `n` in the range [0, 99] and returns the string representation of that number. The function correctly handles cases when `n` is between 0 and 9, between 11 and 19, is a multiple of 10, and other two-digit numbers. The output is a single string consisting only of English lowercase letters and hyphens as required by the problem description. The code exactly follows the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints also agree with the code.
