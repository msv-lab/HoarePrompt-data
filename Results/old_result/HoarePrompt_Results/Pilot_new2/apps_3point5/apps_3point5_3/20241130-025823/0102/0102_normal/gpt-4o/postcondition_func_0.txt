The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` where 0 <= n <= 99 and returns the string representation of that number based on different cases. It returns the string representation of the number 'n' if n is between 0 and 9, the string representation from the 'teens' list if n is between 11 and 19, the string representing the tens place if n is a multiple of 10, and the full string representation of a two-digit number by combining the tens and ones values with a hyphen for other cases.
