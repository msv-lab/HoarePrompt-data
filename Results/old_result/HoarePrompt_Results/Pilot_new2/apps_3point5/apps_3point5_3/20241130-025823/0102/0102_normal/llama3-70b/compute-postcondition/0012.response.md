Postcondition: ***`ones`, `teens`, `tens` are lists of strings. `s` is an integer input. If `s` is less than 10, the string representation of the number corresponding to `s` is printed. If `s` is greater than or equal to 10, the output string is determined based on the value of `s`. If s is less than 20, the output string is taken from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, the output string is a combination of the string at index s//10 in the `tens` list and the string at index s%10 in the `ones` list, separated by a hyphen if the ones place value is not 0.***
