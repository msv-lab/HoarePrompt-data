Postcondition: ***n, t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers, min_wait_time is equal to the current value of wait_time, chosen_route is i + 1 where i is 1, s_i is the first element of the tuple at index i in bus_routes, d_i is the second element of the tuple at index i in bus_routes, s_i is equal to the first element of the tuple at index i in bus_routes, d_i is equal to the second element of the tuple at index i in bus_routes, s_i and d_i are assigned the values of the tuple at index i in bus_routes. If s_i >= t, then wait_time is equal to s_i - t. If s_i < t and (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, wait_time is 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i.***
