You are given a programming problem description and a function definition for a function that solves to this problem. From the problem description, extract a description of the values of the program's input variables and relationship between these variables. We refer to this description as precondition. Print the precondition following the word "Precondition", and surrounded with double asterisks (**). Follow these examples:

# Example 1

Problem description: write a function to find the minimum cost path to reach (m, n) from (0, 0) for the given cost matrix cost[][] and a position (m, n) in cost[][].
Function definition:
```
def min_cost(cost, m, n):
```

Precondition: **cost is a 2D list of non-negative integers, m and n are non-negative integers such that 0 <= m < len(cost) and 0 <= n < len(cost[0]).**

# Example 2

Problem description: Write a function to find the similar elements from the given two tuple lists.
Function definition:
```
def similar_elements(test_tup1, test_tup2):
```

Precondition: **test_tup1 and test_tup2 are tuples.**

# Example 3

Problem description: Write a python function to identify non-prime numbers.
Function definition:
```
def is_not_prime(n):
```

Precondition: **n is an integer greater than 1.**

# Example 4

Problem description: Write a function to find the largest integers from a given list of numbers using heap queue algorithm.
Function definition:
```
def heap_queue_largest(nums,n):
```

Precondition: **nums is a list of integers, and n is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= n <= len(nums).**

# Example 5

Problem description: Write a function to find the number of ways to fill it with 2 x 1 dominoes for the given 3 x n board.
Function definition:
```
def count_ways(n):
```

Precondition: **n is a non-negative integer.**

# Example 6

Problem description: find the average of the positive integers in a list.
Function definition:
```
def func_1(numbers):
```
Precondition: **numbers is a list of integers.**

# Your task

Problem description: It is raining heavily. But this is the first day for Serval, who just became 3 years old, to go to the kindergarten. Unfortunately, he lives far from kindergarten, and his father is too busy to drive him there. The only choice for this poor little boy is to wait for a bus on this rainy day. Under such circumstances, the poor boy will use the first bus he sees no matter where it goes. If several buses come at the same time, he will choose one randomly.

Serval will go to the bus station at time $t$, and there are $n$ bus routes which stop at this station. For the $i$-th bus route, the first bus arrives at time $s_i$ minutes, and each bus of this route comes $d_i$ minutes later than the previous one.

As Serval's best friend, you wonder which bus route will he get on. If several buses arrive at the same time, you can print any of them.


-----Input-----

The first line contains two space-separated integers $n$ and $t$ ($1\leq n\leq 100$, $1\leq t\leq 10^5$) — the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. 

Each of the next $n$ lines contains two space-separated integers $s_i$ and $d_i$ ($1\leq s_i,d_i\leq 10^5$) — the time when the first bus of this route arrives and the interval between two buses of this route.


-----Output-----

Print one number — what bus route Serval will use. If there are several possible answers, you can print any of them.


-----Examples-----
Input
2 2
6 4
9 5

Output
1

Input
5 5
3 3
2 5
5 6
4 9
6 1

Output
3

Input
3 7
2 2
2 3
2 4

Output
1



-----Note-----

In the first example, the first bus of the first route arrives at time $6$, and the first bus of the second route arrives at time $9$, so the first route is the answer.

In the second example, a bus of the third route arrives at time $5$, so it is the answer.

In the third example, buses of the first route come at times $2$, $4$, $6$, $8$, and so fourth, buses of the second route come at times $2$, $5$, $8$, and so fourth and buses of the third route come at times $2$, $6$, $10$, and so on, so $1$ and $2$ are both acceptable answers while $3$ is not.
Function definition:
