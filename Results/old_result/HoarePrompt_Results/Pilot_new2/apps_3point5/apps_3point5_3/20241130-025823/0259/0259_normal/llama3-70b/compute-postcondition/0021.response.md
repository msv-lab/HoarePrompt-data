Output State: n is greater than 0, t is a positive integer, buses contains at least 2 tuples, _ is incremented by n, s and d are assigned values from the second tuple in the list, min_time is equal to the current value of time if time < min_time, otherwise min_time retains its previous value, ans is equal to the current value of i plus 1 if time < min_time, otherwise ans retains its previous value, i is 1, time is equal to `(t - s) % d`. `time` is updated to the value of `(t - s) % d`.
