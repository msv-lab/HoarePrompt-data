The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the constraints that a, b, and c are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000. The function calculates the maximum value among the three integers a, b, and c, and returns this maximum value.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It calculates the maximum value among three positive integers a, b, and c (1 ≤ a, b, c ≤ 1000) and returns this maximum value.**
