Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description. It reads three positive integers a, b, c as input and calculates the minimum number of fruits that can be used to cook the compote (based on the ratio of 1:2:4). It then prints the total number of fruits that can be used in the compote. This matches the requirements specified in the problem description for all potential cases.
