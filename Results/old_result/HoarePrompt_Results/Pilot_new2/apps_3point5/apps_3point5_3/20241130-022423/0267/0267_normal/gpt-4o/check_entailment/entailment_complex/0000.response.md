Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program defines two functions:
   - `func_1` which checks if the number of unique digits in a given number is less than or equal to k. This function is used to determine if a number satisfies the condition in the problem description.
   - `func_2` which iterates over the range [l, r], checks if each number satisfies the condition using `func_1`, and calculates the sum of all such numbers modulo 998244353.

2. The `func_1` function correctly determines if a number has at most k unique digits by converting the number to a string, creating a set of its digits, and comparing the length of the set to k.

3. The `func_2` function correctly iterates over the range [l, r], checks if each number satisfies the condition using `func_1`, and calculates the sum of all such numbers modulo 998244353.

4. The program handles all possible edge cases mentioned in the problem description, such as when k = 1 or when l and r are large numbers.

5. Given the problem description, the code and its annotations, there are no cases where the program deviates from the requirements outlined in the problem description. Hence, the correctness of the program is true.
