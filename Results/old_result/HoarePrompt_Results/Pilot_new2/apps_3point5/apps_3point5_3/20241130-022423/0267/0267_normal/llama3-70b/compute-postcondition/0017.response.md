Output State: **After all iterations of the loop finish, `l` and `r` remain unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `dp` contains the calculated result for dp[n, k], (n, k) is in dp with the value calculated from the loop code, `i` is equal to k, and dp[n, k] is increased by (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)**.
