Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes input for $l$, $r$, and $k$.
2. The `func_1` function correctly checks if a number has at most $k$ different digits.
3. The `func_2` function correctly iterates through the range of numbers from $l$ to $r$ and calculates the sum of numbers that have at most $k$ different digits.
4. The program correctly prints the sum modulo $998244353$.
5. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly calculated by the program.
