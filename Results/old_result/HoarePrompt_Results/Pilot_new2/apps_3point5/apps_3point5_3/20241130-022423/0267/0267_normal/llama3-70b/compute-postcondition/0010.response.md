According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. In this case, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. Before the loop starts, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `n` is greater than or equal to 10, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated results, `k` is not equal to 0, (n, k) is not in `dp`, and `dp[n, k] = 9. So to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `i` should be between 1 and 9, `l` and `r` can remain the same, `n`, `k`, and `dp` should remain the same as well.
State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated results, `k` is not equal to 0, (n, k) is not in `dp`, `n` is greater than or equal to 10, `dp[n, k] = 9, `i` is an integer such that 1 <= `i` <= 9**
