Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After analyzing the code and the problem description, as well as considering the provided examples and output hints, it can be concluded that the code functions correctly for the given problem description. 

The function `func_1` calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, and returns this sum modulo `998244353`. It utilizes memoization with the dictionary `dp` to store previous results. The `count` function correctly handles various cases based on the input parameters and provides the desired output.

The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, including handling the range constraints for `l`, `r`, and `k`. Additionally, the provided examples align with the expected output based on the problem statement.

Therefore, the code is correct based on the problem description and all potential cases.
