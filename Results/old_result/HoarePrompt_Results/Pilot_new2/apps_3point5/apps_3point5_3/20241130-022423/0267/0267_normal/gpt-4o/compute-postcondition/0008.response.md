According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range of `l` and `r`. At the end of the last iteration, `l + 1` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l + 1 <= r < 10^18. To execute the loop one more time, the next value of `num` should be considered. The next value of `num` will be `r + 1`, so for the loop to execute again, `r` should be incremented by 1.
State: **l + 1 and r + 1 are integers such that 1 <= l + 1 <= r + 1 < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, total_sum is an integer**
