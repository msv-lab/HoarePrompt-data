#State of the program right berfore the function call: **l, r, and k are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10.**
def func_1(n, k):
    return len(set(str(n))) <= k
    #The program returns True if the number of unique digits in the string representation of n is less than or equal to k, otherwise it returns False.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function func_1 accepts two parameters, n and k, where n is an integer within the range of 1 to 10^18 and k is an integer within the range of 1 to 10. It returns True if the number of unique digits in the string representation of n is less than or equal to k; otherwise, it returns False. The function checks if the number of unique digits in n is less than or equal to k by converting n to a string, creating a set of its digits, and comparing the length of the set to k.

#State of the program right berfore the function call: l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10.**
def func_2(l, r, k):
    total_sum = 0
    for num in range(l, r + 1):
        if func_1(num, k):
            total_sum = (total_sum + num) % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: l and r are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, k is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, total_sum is an integer. If func_1(num, k) is true for any num in the range [l, r], then total_sum is updated to the sum of all such nums % MOD
    return total_sum
    #The program returns the updated total_sum which is the sum of all nums in the range [l, r] that satisfy func_1(num, k) % MOD
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. The function iterates over the range [l, r] and for each number, it calls `func_1` with the number and `k`. If `func_1` returns true for any number, that number is added to `total_sum`. The final `total_sum` is then returned as the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition func_1(num, k) % MOD.
