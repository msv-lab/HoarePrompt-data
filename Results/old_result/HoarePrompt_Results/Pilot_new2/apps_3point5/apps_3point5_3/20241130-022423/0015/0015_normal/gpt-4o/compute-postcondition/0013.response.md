Postcondition: ***a, b, and c are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. If b == a, 'YES' is printed. If b is not equal to a, then if c == 0, 'NO' is printed. If c is not equal to 0 and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, the program executes the if block. Otherwise, the program executes the else block and 'NO' is printed.***
