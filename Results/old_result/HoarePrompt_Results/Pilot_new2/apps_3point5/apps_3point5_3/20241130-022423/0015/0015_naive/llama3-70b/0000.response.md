Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if the favorite number b appears in the sequence s based on the given conditions. It handles the case when c is equal to 0 and when b - a is divisible by c and the result is non-negative. The logic covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. The program outputs "YES" if b appears in the sequence s and "NO" otherwise. The code will work for all the given examples and all potential cases.
