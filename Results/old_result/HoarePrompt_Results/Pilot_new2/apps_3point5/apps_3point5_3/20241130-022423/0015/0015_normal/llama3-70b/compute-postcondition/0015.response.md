Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three integers a, b, and c from input, and based on the values of a, b, and c, it determines whether to print 'YES' or 'NO' following specific conditions. If c is 0, it checks if a is equal to b and prints 'YES' accordingly. If c is not 0, it checks if (b - a) is divisible by c and the division result is non-negative to print 'YES'. If none of these conditions are met, it prints 'NO'. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to perform comparisons and print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the calculated conditions. **
