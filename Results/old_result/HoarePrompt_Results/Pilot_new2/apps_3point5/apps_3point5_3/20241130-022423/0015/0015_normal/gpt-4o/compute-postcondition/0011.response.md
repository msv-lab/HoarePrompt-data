Postcondition: ***a, b, and c are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9. a, b, and c are assigned the integer values obtained from splitting the input. b is not equal to a. c is not equal to 0. If the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then the program executes the if block. Otherwise, the program executes the else block and 'NO' is printed.***
