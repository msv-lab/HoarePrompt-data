Correctness: **True**

The program reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input, and based on the problem description, it correctly determines if Vasya's favorite number `b` appears in a sequence with the first element `a` and a difference of `c` between neighboring elements. It follows the conditions mentioned and prints 'YES' if `b` is found in the sequence, and 'NO' if it is not. The program correctly handles all possible cases described in the problem description.
