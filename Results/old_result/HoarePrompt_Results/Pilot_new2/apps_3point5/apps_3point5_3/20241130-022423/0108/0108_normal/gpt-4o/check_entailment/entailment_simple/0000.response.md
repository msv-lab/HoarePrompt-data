Correctness: **True**

The provided annotated program correctly follows the problem description. It reads a string `s` as input and then iterates through both the input string `s` and the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' to check if the characters in `s` match the characters in the target string. If all characters in the target string are found in `s`, it prints the target string. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program ensures that the string obtained from the input string will contain the English alphabet as a subsequence. It correctly handles the case where it is impossible to obtain the target string and prints -1 in that scenario.

Therefore, the program is correct and follows the problem description as specified.
