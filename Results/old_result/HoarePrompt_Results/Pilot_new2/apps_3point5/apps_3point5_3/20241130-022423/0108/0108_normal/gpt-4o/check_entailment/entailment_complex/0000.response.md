Correctness: **True**

The program reads a string `s` and checks if it is possible to obtain the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' as a subsequence of `s` by comparing each character of `s` with 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' character by character. If it is possible, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', otherwise it prints -1. This matches the requirements of the problem description. The program correctly determines if it is possible to obtain the target string as a subsequence of the input string.
