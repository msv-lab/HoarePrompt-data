Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly reads the input string `s` and iterates over the English alphabet characters. It then replaces the characters in the input string with the next alphabetical character until the entire alphabet is formed as a subsequence. If the length of the resulting string is 26 (the length of the English alphabet), it prints the resulting string, otherwise it prints -1. The logic provided in the program covers all potential cases as per the problem description and produces the correct output for each case.
