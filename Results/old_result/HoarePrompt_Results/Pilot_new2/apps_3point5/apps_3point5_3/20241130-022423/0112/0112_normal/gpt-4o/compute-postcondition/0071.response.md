Functionality: ** The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, which is an integer greater than 0. It then iterates through the digits of `num` and checks if each digit can be formed using a set of cube faces. If all digits can be formed, it returns True. If any digit cannot be formed, it returns False. However, there is a discrepancy between the annotations and the actual code as the annotations mention returning False in all cases, whereas the code returns True if all digits can be formed successfully. **
