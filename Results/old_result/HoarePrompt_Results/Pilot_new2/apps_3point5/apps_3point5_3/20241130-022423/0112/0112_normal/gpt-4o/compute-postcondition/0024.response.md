According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has more digits to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True, `found` is True, and `found` is still False after not entering the if block. So for the loop to execute one more time, the list `digits` must have more digits to iterate over, and the `digit` being iterated must be the second last digit in the list.
State: **After all iterations of the loop, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the second last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True, `found` is True, and `found` is still False after not entering the if block**
