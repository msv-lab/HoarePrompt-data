According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 2 digits, `digit` is the second last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True except for the element at index `i+1` which is now True, `found` is True, `n` is equal to `num`, `i` is the updated index after increment, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 

To execute the loop one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 2 digits, `digit` is the second last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True except for the element at index `i+2` which should be set to True, `found` is True, `n` is equal to `num`, `i` is the updated index after increment and should be incremented by 1**
