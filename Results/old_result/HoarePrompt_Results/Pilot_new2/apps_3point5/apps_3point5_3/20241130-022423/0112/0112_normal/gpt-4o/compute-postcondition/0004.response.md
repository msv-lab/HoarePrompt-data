According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `num` is an integer greater than 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. In addition, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are False, and `found` is False must be maintained.
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are False, `found` is False, `n` must be greater than 0**.
