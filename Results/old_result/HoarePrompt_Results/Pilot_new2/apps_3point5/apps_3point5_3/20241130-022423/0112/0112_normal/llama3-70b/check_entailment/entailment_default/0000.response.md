Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not account for the constraint that Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. This means that the cubes containing 6 and 9 should be considered separately, but the code simply concatenates all digits together without considering this constraint. This results in a potential case where the maximum number x such Masha can make may not be accurate.
