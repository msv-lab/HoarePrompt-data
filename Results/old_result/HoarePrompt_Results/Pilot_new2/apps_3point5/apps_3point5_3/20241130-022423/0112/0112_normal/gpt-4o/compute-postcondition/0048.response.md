According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. Since `n` is not defined in the state before the loop starts, we need to adjust it. Also, the state mentions that `num` is an integer greater than 0, so `n` should be assigned the value of `num`. Additionally, in order to execute the loop, `digits` must contain at least 2 digits, `digit` must be the second last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` must be True, and the condition `found` must be False. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`num` is an integer greater than 0, `digits` is a list containing at least 2 digits, `digit` is the second last digit in the list, all elements in `used_cubes` are True, the condition `found` is False, `n` is equal to `num`**
