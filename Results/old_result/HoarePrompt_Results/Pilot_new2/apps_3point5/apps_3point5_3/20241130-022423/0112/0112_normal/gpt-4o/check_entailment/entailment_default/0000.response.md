Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The `can_form_number` function does not correctly handle the case where a digit can be formed by multiple cubes. For example, if a number requires the digit '1' and both cube 1 and cube 2 have the digit '1', the function will count only one of them as used and return False, even though the number can still be formed. This means that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
