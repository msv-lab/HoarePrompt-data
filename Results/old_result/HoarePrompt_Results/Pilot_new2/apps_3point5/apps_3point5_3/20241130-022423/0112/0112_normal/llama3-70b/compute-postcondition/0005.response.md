According to the code, the loop can execute again based on the `cubes` list. If there is at least one more inner list in the `cubes` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 1 inner list, `cube` is the first inner list in the `cubes` list, and `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the `cube` list. 

So for the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more inner list in the `cubes` list, and the loop will then move to the next inner list.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists that must have at least 2 inner lists, `cube` is the second inner list in the `cubes` list, `digits` is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the `cube` list**
