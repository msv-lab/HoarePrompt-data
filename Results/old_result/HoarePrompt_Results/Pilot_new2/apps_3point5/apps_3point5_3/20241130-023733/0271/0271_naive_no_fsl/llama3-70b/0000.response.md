Correctness: True

The provided program correctly rounds the given number to the nearest integer that ends in zero, as specified in the problem description. It checks if the number already ends in zero, in which case it prints the number as is. If the last digit of the number is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from the number. If the last digit is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to the number. This logic covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement.
