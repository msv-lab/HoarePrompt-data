Output State: **n is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9), remainder is the remainder of n divided by 10. If remainder is less than or equal to 5, then result is equal to n - remainder. If remainder is greater than 5, then result is equal to n + (10 - remainder). n - remainder or n + (10 - remainder) is printed.**
