According to the code, the loop can execute up to half the length of the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s` which is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0. 
For the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the conditions when `s[i] != s[n - i - 1]` to break out of the loop or if statement. 
As `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s` which is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 1**
