Postcondition: ***`s` is a string containing only English letters with a length between 2 and 1000, `n` is the length of string `s` which is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, `i` remains 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
