Functionality: **The function `func` reads input integers x, y, and z, and based on their values, it determines the relationship between them. If x is greater than the sum of y and z, it prints '+'. If x is less than or equal to the sum of y and z, it further checks:
- If x is less than y, it prints '-'.
- If x is equal to y, it checks the value of z:
  - If z is 0, it prints '0'.
  - If z is not 0, it prints '?'.
The function does not explicitly return any value but performs print statements based on the conditions met.**
