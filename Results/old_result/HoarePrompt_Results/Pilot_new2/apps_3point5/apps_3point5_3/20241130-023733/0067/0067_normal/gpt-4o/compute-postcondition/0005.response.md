Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the integers obtained from the input split. `min_upvotes` is equal to the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. The current values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are as assigned. The current state of the program variables satisfies the condition: `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`.***
