According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more colors in the list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, colors is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least 2 colors, color is the second color in the list. To execute the loop one more time, there must be at least one more color in the colors list and color should be the third color in the list.
State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n, colors is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least 3 colors, color is the third color in the list, counts is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, color_counts is a dictionary with the key color and value 2 if color is not already in color_counts**
