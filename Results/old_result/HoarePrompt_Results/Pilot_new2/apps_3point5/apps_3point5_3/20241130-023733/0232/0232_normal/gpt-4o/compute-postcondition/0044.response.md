Postcondition: ***The function will return 'YES' only if all colors in `colors` have the same count as in `desired_counts`. `left` and `right` variables will have their final values based on the loop iterations. The `current_counts` dictionary must have the same count for each color as in `desired_counts`. After entering the if condition, it can be guaranteed that all colors in `current_counts` have the same count as in `desired_counts`***
