Output State: The function will return 'YES' only if all colors in `colors` have the same count as in `desired_counts`. `left` variable will have its final value such that `left` has been incremented by the number of times the loop executed. The `current_counts` dictionary must have the same count for each color as in `desired_counts`. There exists at least one color in `colors` where the count in `current_counts` is not the same as in `desired_counts`. `current_counts[colors[left]]` has been decremented by the total number of times the loop executed.
