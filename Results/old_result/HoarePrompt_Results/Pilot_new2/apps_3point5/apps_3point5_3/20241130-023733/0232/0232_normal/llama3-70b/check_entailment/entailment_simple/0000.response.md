Correctness: **True**

The program correctly solves the problem as described in the problem statement. It reads the input values, counts the occurrences of each color, and then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights, checking if the desired counts of lightsabers can be achieved. If such an interval exists, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".

The program uses nested loops to iterate through all possible intervals efficiently, and the logic within the loops correctly tracks the counts of each color within the window. Finally, it checks if the current window matches the desired counts and sets a flag accordingly.

Therefore, the program follows the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
