Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and aligns with the problem description. The function `func_1` correctly creates a dictionary of desired counts for each color and iterates through the colors list, updating the current counts of each color. It then checks if all current counts match the desired counts for each color, returning 'YES' if all conditions are met. If the conditions are not met, it returns 'NO'. The code handles cases where all colors have the same count as desired, and cases where not all colors meet the desired counts, accurately determining the final return value based on the color counts. The output hints also align with the code's functionality.
