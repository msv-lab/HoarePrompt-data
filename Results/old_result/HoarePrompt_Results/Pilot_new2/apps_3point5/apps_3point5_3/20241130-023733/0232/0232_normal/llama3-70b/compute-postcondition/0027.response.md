Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 0 and n-1, `colors` is a list of integers obtained from the input with at least n colors, `color` is the last color in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input, `color_counts` is a dictionary with the key as each distinct color in colors and the value is the count of that color in the list, `found` is False, `window_counts` is a dictionary with color as the key and value equal to 1 for the `color` and 0 for all other colors, `j` equals `i`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list. The current values of the variables are based on the precondition. All `window_counts` values are sorted and matched with the counts list, and if they are all equal, the postcondition is satisfied.***
