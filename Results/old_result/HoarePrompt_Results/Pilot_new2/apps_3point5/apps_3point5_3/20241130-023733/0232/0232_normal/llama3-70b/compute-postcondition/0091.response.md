Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer greater than `i` + 4, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `n`, `window_counts` is populated based on sorted values in the `counts` list, `found` is True, `color` is the value of `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The condition where all counts in `window_counts.values()` are equal to corresponding targets in the `counts` list is satisfied.***
