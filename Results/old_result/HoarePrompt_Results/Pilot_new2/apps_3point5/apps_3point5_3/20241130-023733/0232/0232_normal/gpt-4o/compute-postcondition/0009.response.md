Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, colors is a list of n integers, desired_counts is a dictionary with keys from 1 to m, current_counts is a defaultdict(int) with keys from 1 to m where at least one current_counts[color] is less than desired_counts[color], left = 0, right starts from 0 and goes up to n-1. There exists at least one color such that current_counts[color] is not equal to desired_counts[color. After executing the code, current_counts[colors[left]] is decreased by 1.**
