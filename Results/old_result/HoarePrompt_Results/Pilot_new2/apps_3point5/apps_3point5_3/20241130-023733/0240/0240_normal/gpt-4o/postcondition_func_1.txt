The function `is_valid_number` takes in two parameters, `num_str` (a string representing a very large integer) and `sub` (a substring of `num_str`). It returns True if the substring `sub` is present in `num_str` and the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`. Otherwise, it returns False. However, there is a missing implementation in the code, as the variable `n_len` is not defined or used within the function. This leads to potential inaccuracies in the function's behavior, and the functionality may not fully align with the annotations provided.
