Postcondition: ***`chars` has at least 1 more permutation, a new `candidate` is formed from the new permutation. If the `candidate` is a valid number based on the criteria specified in the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`, then the program executes the if block. Otherwise, there is no else block in the code.***
