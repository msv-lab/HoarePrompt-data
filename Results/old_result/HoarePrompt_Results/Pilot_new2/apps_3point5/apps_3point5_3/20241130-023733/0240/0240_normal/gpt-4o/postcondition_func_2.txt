The function generate_possible_numbers accepts two parameters, chars (a string of characters) and sub (a subset of chars), and generates all possible numbers by permuting the characters in sub. It then checks if each candidate number is valid by calling the is_valid_number function with respect to sub. The function yields all valid candidate numbers.
