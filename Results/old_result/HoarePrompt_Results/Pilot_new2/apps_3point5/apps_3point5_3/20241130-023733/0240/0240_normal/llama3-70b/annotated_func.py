#State of the program right berfore the function call: s and t are strings.**
def func_1(s, t):
    t_set = set(t)
    n = ''
    for c in s:
        if c in t_set:
            n += c
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: s is not empty, t is a string, t_set is a set containing unique elements from string t, n is a string consisting of characters from t_set that are present in string s.
    n += t
    return int(n)
    #The program returns an integer value of 'n' which is the string consisting of characters from t_set that are present in string s, n has been concatenated with string t
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters `s` and `t`. It then iterates through string `s` to find characters that are present in string `t`. The function returns an integer value that is the concatenation of the characters found in `s` from `t`, followed by the entire string `t`. There are no specific edge cases or missing logic in the provided code.
