According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`, the String being iterated over. If there are more characters left in `s`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is not empty, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is a string consisting of characters from `t_set` including the character `c` from the next iteration. If `c` is in `t_set`, `n` includes the character `c` from the next iteration. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next character `c` from `s` should be considered. So, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **s is not empty, t is a string, t_set is a set containing unique elements from string t, n is a string consisting of characters from t_set including the character c from the next iteration, c is the next character in s**
