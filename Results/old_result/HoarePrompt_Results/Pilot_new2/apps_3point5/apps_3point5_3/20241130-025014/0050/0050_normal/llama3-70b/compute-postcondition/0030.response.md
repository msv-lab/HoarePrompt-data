Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` are integers. `n` and `m` are between 1 and 30. `r` is between 0 and the maximum value of `s`. `s` is a list of integers in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers in descending order. If shares > 0, `shares` is updated to 0. If shares <= 0, all variables remain unchanged, and `m` must be greater than 0.***
