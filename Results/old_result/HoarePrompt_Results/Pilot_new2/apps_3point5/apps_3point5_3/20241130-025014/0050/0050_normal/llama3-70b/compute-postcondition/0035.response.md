Postcondition: ***`n`, `m-1`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` are integers where `m-1` is between 1 and 29. If shares > 0, `r` is incremented by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, where `i` is the index of `b`. `shares` is set to 0. If shares <= 0, we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
