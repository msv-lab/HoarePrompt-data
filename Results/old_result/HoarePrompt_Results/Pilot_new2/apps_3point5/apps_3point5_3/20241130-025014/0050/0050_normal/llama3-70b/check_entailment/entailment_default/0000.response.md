Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code accurately implements the problem description. It reads the input values and then iterates through the list of shares to calculate the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the given amount of bourles. It then iterates through the list of selling opportunities to update the amount of bourles based on the number of shares bought. The final amount of bourles is printed as the output.

The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly considers buying shares in the morning based on the available bourles and then selling them in the evening while updating the total amount of bourles. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming its correctness.
