Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` are integers where `m` is between 1 and 29. In the if part, `r` is updated based on the formula `r += shares * b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. In the else part, `n`, `m`, `r'`, `s`, `b` remain the same as integers where `m` is between 1 and 29, `r'` is updated based on the conditions mentioned above, and `shares` is reset to 0. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
