Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum buy price and the maximum sell price. It then checks if it is profitable to buy shares in the morning and sell them in the evening. If it is not profitable, it simply prints the bourles held in the morning. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the bourles held in the morning, calculates the remaining bourles after buying those shares, and finally calculates the total bourles after selling all the bought shares in the evening. The logic seems correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
