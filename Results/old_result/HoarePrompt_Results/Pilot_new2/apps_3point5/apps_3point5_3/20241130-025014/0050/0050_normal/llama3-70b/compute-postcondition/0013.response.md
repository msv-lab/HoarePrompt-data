According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged. For the next iteration to occur, `n` must be increased by 1.
State: **`n+1`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged**
