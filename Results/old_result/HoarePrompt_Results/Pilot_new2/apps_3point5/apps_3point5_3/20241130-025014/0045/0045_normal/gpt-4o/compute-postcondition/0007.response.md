According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is at least 1. The loop iterates from `k - 1` to `0`. Before the loop starts, the conditions to ensure the loop executes are:
- `k` is at least 1
- `i` is initialized to `k - 1`

State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; min_sum is equal to k*(k+1)/2 and less than or equal to n; d is calculated as the floor division of n by min_sum; remainder is equal to n - d * min_sum; sequence is a list containing elements d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd, i is initialized to k - 1**
