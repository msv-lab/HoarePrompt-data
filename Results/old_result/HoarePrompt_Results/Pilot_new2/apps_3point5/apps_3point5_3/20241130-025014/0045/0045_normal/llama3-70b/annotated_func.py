#State of the program right berfore the function call: **a and b are positive integers.
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: a is equal to the greatest common divisor of the original values of a and b, b is 0
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the original values of a and b, where b is 0.
#Overall this is what the function does:The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters, `a` and `b`. It calculates the greatest common divisor of the original values of `a` and `b` by utilizing the Euclidean algorithm until `b` becomes 0. The function then returns this greatest common divisor. Therefore, the main purpose of the function is to compute the greatest common divisor of two positive integers `a` and `b` when `b` is 0.
