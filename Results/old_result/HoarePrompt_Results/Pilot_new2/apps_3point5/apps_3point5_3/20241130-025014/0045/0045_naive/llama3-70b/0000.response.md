Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two input integers n and k. It then checks if n is less than k, it prints -1 as the output. Otherwise, it creates a sequence of k positive numbers starting from 1 and incrementing by 1 until n is exhausted. If the sequence is successfully created, it prints the sequence as the output. The program seems to be correctly following the problem description for all potential cases.
