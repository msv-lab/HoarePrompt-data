According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is within the range of `k - 1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is initialized to `k - 1` and the value of `sequence[i]` is increased by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` should be decremented by 1 and it should still be within the range of `k-1` to 0.
State: **Output State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; min_sum is equal to k*(k+1)/2 and less than or equal to n; d is calculated as the floor division of n by min_sum; remainder is equal to n - d * min_sum - 1; sequence is a list containing elements d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd, i is initialized to k - 2 and the value of sequence[i] is increased by 1**
