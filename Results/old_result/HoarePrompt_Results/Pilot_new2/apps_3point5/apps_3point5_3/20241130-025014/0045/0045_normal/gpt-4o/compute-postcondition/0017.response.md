Output State: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; min_sum is equal to k*(k+1)/2 and less than or equal to n; d is calculated as the floor division of n by min_sum; remainder is equal to n - d * min_sum - 2; sequence is a list containing elements d, 2d, 3d, ..., kd, i is initialized to k - 2 and the value of sequence[i] is increased by 1. If remainder is 0, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.
