The function `func` reads two integers `x` and `y` from input and calculates the result of `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`. The constraints specify that `x` and `y` are integers where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and the output is based on the formula mentioned.
