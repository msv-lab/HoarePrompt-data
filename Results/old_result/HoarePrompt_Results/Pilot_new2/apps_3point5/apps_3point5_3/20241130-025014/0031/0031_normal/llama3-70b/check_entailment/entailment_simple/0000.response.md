Correctness: **True**

The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It calculates the probability as an irreducible fraction A/B and returns the remainders of A and B divided by 10^6 + 3.

The program iterates through the range of k and calculates the numerator as the product of (2^n - i) for each i in the range. It also calculates the denominator as 2^(k*n). Then, it finds the greatest common divisor of the numerator and the denominator and reduces the fraction to its irreducible form.

Finally, the program returns the remainders of the numerator and the denominator modulo 10^6 + 3.

The program follows the problem description and always calculates the correct probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in the given scenario.
