According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, total_days = 2^n, numerator = (2^n - i), denominator = 2^n. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, total_days = 2^n, numerator = (2^n - (i+1)), denominator = 2^n**
