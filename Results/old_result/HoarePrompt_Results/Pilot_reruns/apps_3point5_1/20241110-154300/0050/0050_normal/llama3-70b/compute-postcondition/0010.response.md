Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are positive integers, `b` is sorted in descending order, `s` is sorted in ascending order, `shares` is 0. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is updated by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop breaks.***
