Example Answer:
A list `b` is created by converting the input values to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of variables `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions, and `b` is a list containing the input values as integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given conditions, and `b` is a list containing the input values as integers**
