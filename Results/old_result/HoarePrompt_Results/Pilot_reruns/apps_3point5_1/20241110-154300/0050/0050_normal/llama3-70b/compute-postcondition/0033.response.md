According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `r`, `b`, `s`, `i` are positive integers, list `b` is sorted in descending order, list `s` is sorted in ascending order. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and the element at index `i` in list `b`, and `shares` is reset to 0. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `i` is less than `m+1` to allow for one more iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `b`, `s`, `i` are positive integers. List `b` is sorted in descending order, list `s` is sorted in ascending order. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and the element at index `i` in list `b`, and `shares` is reset to 0. `i` is less than `m+1`.**
