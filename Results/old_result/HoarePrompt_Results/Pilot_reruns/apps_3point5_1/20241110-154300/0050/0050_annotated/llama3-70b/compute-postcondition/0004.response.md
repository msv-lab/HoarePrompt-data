Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in descending order using the `sort` method with `reverse=True`. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a sorted list of integers in descending order**
