Example Answer:
The list `s` is assigned the result of mapping the `int` function to each element obtained by splitting the input by spaces. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input**
