Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description by first sorting the prices of buying and selling shares, then iterates through the buying opportunities to purchase as many shares as possible within the budget. After that, it iterates through the selling opportunities to sell all the bought shares at the highest possible price. The program handles the case where there are more buying opportunities than selling opportunities and vice versa. The final output is the maximum number of bourles the user can hold after the evening, which is in line with the problem requirements.
