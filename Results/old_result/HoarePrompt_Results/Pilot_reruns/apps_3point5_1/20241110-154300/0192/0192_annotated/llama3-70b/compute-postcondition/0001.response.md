Example Answer:
The absolute difference between `x` and `y` is calculated using the `abs()` function and printed. The values of `x` and `y` are input integers where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the output state is: 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the absolute difference between x and y is printed.
Output State: **3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, and the absolute difference between x and y is printed**
