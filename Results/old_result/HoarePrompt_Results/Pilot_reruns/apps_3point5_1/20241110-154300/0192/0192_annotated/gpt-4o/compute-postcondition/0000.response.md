Example Answer:
The values of x and y are taken as input and converted to integers. Since the input is expected to be two integers separated by a space, x and y will be assigned those values accordingly. The values of x and y are ensured to be integers within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers satisfying the condition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers satisfying the condition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
