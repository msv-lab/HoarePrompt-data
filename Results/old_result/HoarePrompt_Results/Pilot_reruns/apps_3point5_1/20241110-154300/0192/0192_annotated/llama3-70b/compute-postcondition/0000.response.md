Example Answer:
`x` and `y` are assigned values from the input split by space and converted to integers. Given the precondition, `x` is greater than `y`, so they are assigned valid values. Therefore, the Output State is: **3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000; x and y are input integers.**
Output State: **3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000; x and y are input integers.**
