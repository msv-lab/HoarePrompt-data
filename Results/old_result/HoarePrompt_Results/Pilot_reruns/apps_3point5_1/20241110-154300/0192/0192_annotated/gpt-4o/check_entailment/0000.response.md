Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes two integers `x` and `y` as input, representing the starting and ending side lengths of an equilateral triangle. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length `y` from `x` using the formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2` and prints the output.

The code follows the problem description as it correctly calculates the minimum number of operations needed to transform the equilateral triangle from side length `x` to side length `y`. The formula used in the code aligns with the logic described in the problem statement, where one side of the triangle is reduced by 1 each time until all sides are equal to `y`.

Overall, the code is correct for all potential cases as it fulfills the requirements mentioned in the problem description. The annotations also agree with the code logic and do not suggest any cases where the code might fail to meet the requirements.
