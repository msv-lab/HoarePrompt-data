The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the sum of all numbers between x and y (inclusive) that are divisible by 7 but not divisible by 5, where x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the sum of numbers between x and y that are divisible by 7 but not divisible by 5, where x and y meet the specified constraints.
