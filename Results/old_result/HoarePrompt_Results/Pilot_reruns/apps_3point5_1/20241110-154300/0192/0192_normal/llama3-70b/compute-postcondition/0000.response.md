Example Answer:
The values of x and y are assigned by splitting the input. Since x and y are integers where 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, after execution, x and y will hold the input values provided they satisfy the given constraints.
Output State: **x and y hold the input values, satisfying the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
