Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` that takes two parameters `n` and `k` and returns a sequence of `k` positive numbers such that their sum is equal to `n` and the greatest common divisor is maximal. The function calculates the minimum sum of the sequence based on `k`, checks if it is greater than `n`, calculates the divisor `d`, distributes the remainder if any, and then constructs the sequence.

The program then takes input for `n` and `k`, calls the `func_1` function, and prints the resulting sequence. The logic within the function seems correct as it follows the problem description by ensuring a strictly increasing sequence with the maximal greatest common divisor and handling cases where the answer does not exist by returning -1. 

After reviewing the code and considering different scenarios, it appears that the program is correct in its implementation.
