Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are positive integers where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. If `remainder` is equal to 0, then the program execution stops. In all other cases, the program continues as described in the precondition, where `remainder` is decreased by 1, `sequence[i]` is increased by 1, and `i` is k-3.***
