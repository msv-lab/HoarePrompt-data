Functionality: The function func_1 accepts two positive integers n and k within the range of 1 to 10^10. It calculates the sum of numbers from 1 to k, and if the sum exceeds n, it returns -1. The function then determines a sequence based on the calculated sum and handles the remainder accordingly. If the remainder is 0 before the loop starts, the sequence remains unchanged, and the remainder is 0. If the remainder is not 0 before the loop starts, the sequence values may change, and the remainder becomes 0 after the loop executes.
