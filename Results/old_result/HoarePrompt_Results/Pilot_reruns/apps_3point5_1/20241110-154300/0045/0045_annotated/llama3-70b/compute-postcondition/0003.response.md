According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is non-zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is true (non-zero) and `b` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to a non-zero value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is true (non-zero), `b` is non-zero**
