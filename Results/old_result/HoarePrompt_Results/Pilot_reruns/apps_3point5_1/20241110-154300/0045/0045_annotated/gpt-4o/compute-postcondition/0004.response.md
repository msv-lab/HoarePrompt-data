Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated by subtracting `d` times `min_sum` from `n`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `min_sum` are given as positive integers, and `min_sum` is the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`, and `remainder` is the result of the subtraction.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of numbers from 1 to `k`, and `remainder` is the result of the subtraction**
