The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ 10^10. If `b` is 0, then `a` is the greatest common divisor of the initial `a` and `b`, and `b` is 0 at the end. If `b` is not 0, then `a` and `b` are updated according to the loop logic, and the function returns the final value of `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, and return the final value of `a` after updating `a` and `b` based on the loop logic.
