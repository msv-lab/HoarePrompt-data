Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated by subtracting `d` multiplied by `min_sum` from `n`. The values of `min_sum` and `d` are already defined in terms of `k` and `n`. Therefore, the output state is: `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is calculated by dividing `n` by `min_sum`, and `remainder` is the result of the subtraction.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is calculated by dividing `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of the subtraction**
