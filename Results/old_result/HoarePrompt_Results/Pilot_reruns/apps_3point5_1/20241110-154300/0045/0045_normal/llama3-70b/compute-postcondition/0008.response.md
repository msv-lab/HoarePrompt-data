The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`. `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= 10^10. If b is not 0, the loop will continue executing based on the given conditions. After the loop terminates, the function returns the final value of `a` after the iterations. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, continue executing a loop based on the conditions while b is not 0, and return the final value of `a` after the iterations.
