Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is calculated by dividing `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is either 0 or decremented by the number of iterations of the loop, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is -1 after the loop finishes. If `remainder` is 0 at any point during the loop, the program breaks out of the loop. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and the values remain the same as the initial state. The function returns `sequence`.**
