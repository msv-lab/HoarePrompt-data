Example Answer: 
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and then `a` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `b` is truthy, the modulo operation is performed. The output state after execution is the new values of `a` and `b` after the swap and modulo operation.
Output State: **New values of `a` and `b` after the swap and modulo operation**
