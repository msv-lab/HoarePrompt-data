According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, new values of `a` and `b` after the swap and modulo operation are known. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **New values of `a` and `b` after the swap and modulo operation, where `b` is not equal to 0**
