According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is within the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, the states are as follows: `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is calculated by dividing `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 2, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is -1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the loop. The value of `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be within the specified range for the next iteration. In this case, since the loop is iterating in reverse from `k - 1` to -1, the next value for `i` should be one less than the current value of `i` (-1).

State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is calculated by dividing `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 2, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for `i` ranging from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is -2**
