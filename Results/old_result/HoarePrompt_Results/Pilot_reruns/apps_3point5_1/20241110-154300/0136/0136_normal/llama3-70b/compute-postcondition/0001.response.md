Example Answer:
The input is accepted and leading zeros are removed from the input, then the modified input is assigned to variable `b`. The value of `b` is now the modified input string without leading zeros. The value of `a` remains unaffected.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros removed, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros**
