Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits. If `b` is not set, it is assigned the value '0'. After the execution of the if-else block, regardless of the comparison results, `a` remains 0 and `b` remains '0'. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, the program prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='.***
