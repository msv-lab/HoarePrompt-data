Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the input with leading zeros removed. The input is a non-negative integer represented as a string. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros removed, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with leading zeros removed, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
