Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code accurately follows the problem description. It reads two non-negative integers represented as strings, `a` and `b`, and compares them. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. The code also correctly removes leading zeros from the input integers. The program handles cases where `a` and `b` have up to 10^6 digits. 
After reviewing the code and the description, and checking for potential edge cases, it seems that the code meets all the requirements specified.
