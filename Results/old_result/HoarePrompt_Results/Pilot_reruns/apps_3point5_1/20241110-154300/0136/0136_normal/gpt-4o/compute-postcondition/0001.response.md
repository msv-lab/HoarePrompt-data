Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `data` after removing leading zeros. The values of `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits, so the output state is: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits**
