Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input integers a and b correctly.
2. It removes leading zeroes from both a and b.
3. It compares the lengths of a and b, and prints < if len(a) < len(b), > if len(a) > len(b), and = if len(a) = len(b).
4. If the lengths are equal, it compares the values of a and b and prints < if a < b, > if a > b, and = if a = b.
5. The program covers all possible cases as mentioned in the problem description and outputs the correct symbol based on the comparison.
