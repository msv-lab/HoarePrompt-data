Example Answer:
The input is taken as a string and leading zeros are removed using the `lstrip('0')` function. The resulting value is assigned to `b`. The value of `a` remains the same since it is not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no more than 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no more than 10^6 digits**
