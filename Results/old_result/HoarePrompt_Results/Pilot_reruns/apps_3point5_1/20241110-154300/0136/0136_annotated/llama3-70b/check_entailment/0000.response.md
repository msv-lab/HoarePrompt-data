Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly takes two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input, compares them, and prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if they are equal. The code handles the case where the numbers contain leading zeros by stripping them before comparison. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of the program's functionality, which aligns with the problem description. Since there are no cases identified where the program does not work as expected, and all examples provided match the problem description, the code is considered correct.
