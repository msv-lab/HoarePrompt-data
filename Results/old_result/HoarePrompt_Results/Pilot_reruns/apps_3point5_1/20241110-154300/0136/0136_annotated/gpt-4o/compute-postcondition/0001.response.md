Example Answer: 
The variable `a` is assigned the value of `data[0]` with leading zeros removed. This means that any leading zeros in the string `a` are removed. The variable `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, so the output state is `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
