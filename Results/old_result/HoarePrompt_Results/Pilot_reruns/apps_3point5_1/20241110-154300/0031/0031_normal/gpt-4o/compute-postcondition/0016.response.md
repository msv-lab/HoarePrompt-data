According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.
State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, numerator is updated, denominator is updated, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 1**
