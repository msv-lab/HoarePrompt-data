Example Answer:
The `numerator` is updated by multiplying the current value of `numerator` with the result of `(total_days - i) % MOD`. The value of `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, `i` is 1, and `MOD` is 1000003. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, numerator is updated, denominator is updated, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, numerator is updated, denominator is updated, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1**
