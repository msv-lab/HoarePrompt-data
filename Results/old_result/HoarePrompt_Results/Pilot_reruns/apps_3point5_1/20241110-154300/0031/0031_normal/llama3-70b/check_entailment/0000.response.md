Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly calculates the values of `numerator` and `denominator` as per the problem description.
- It then calculates the gcd of `numerator` and `denominator`, updates the values by dividing them by the gcd, and returns the remainders of `numerator` and `denominator` divided by (10^6 + 3).
- The output hints also agree with the code by explaining the process of calculating `numerator` and `denominator`, finding the gcd, and returning the remainders.
- The code handles the edge cases where `n` and `k` are at their minimum and maximum limits according to the problem description.
