The function `func_1` takes two integers `n` and `k`, calculates the values of `numerator` and `denominator` based on a loop, then finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `numerator` and `denominator`. After updating `numerator` and `denominator` by dividing them by the gcd, the function returns the remainders of `numerator` and `denominator` divided by (10^6 + 3).
