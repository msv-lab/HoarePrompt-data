Example Answer:
`denominator` is assigned the value 1. The other variables `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, `numerator` is 1 are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, numerator is 1, denominator is 1.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, numerator is 1, denominator is 1**
