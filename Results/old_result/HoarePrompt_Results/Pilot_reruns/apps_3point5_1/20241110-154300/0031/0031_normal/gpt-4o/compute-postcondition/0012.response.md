Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying `denominator` with `total_days` modulo `MOD`. The previous values of `denominator`, `total_days`, and `MOD` are unknown, so the new value of `denominator` after calculation is also unknown. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, `numerator` is updated according to the calculation, `denominator` is updated according to the calculation, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
