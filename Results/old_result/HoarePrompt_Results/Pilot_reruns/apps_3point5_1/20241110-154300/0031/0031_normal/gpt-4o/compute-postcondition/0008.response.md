Example Answer:
The `numerator` is updated by multiplying its current value with the result of `(total_days - i) % MOD`. The current values are `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, and `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, the updated value of `numerator` is calculated using the formula: `numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`. 
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
