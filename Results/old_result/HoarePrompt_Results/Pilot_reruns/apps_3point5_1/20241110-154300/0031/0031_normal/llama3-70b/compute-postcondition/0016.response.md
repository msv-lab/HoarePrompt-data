Example Answer: 
`denominator` is updated by performing floor division with `gcd`, and since `numerator` is also updated after division by `gcd`, the value of `denominator` changes accordingly. The values of `i` and `gcd` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is updated after division by `gcd`, `denominator` is updated after floor division by `gcd`, `i` and `gcd` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`numerator` is updated after division by `gcd`, `denominator` is updated after floor division by `gcd`, `i` and `gcd` remain unchanged**
