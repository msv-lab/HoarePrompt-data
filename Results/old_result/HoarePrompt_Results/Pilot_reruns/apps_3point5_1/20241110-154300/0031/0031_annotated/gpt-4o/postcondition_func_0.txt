The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both integers. The function calculates the greatest common divisor of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is not equal to 0, `a` holds the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `a` and `b`, and `b` is updated to 0. If `b` is initially equal to 0, `a` and `b` remain unchanged, and the function returns the value of `a`. The function effectively computes the greatest common divisor of two integers `a` and `b`.
