According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`total_days` is the result of 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by (2^n) * (total_days - 2), `denominator` is equal to the updated value after multiplying by `total_days`, `n` is a valid integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `numerator` is multiplied by (total_days - i), `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`**
