Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters `n` and `k`, calculates the values of `numerator`, `denominator`, and `gcd` based on the provided conditions. It then returns the remainder of `numerator` divided by (10^6 + 3) and the remainder of `denominator` divided by (10^6 + 3). The function ensures constraints on `n` and `k` and handles the calculations accordingly.**
