Example Answer: 
The variable `MOD` is assigned the value `10 ** 6 + 3`, which is 1000003. The other variables `n` and `k` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD` is 1000003, and `n` and `k` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `n` and `k` remain unchanged**
