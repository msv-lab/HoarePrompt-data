Output State: **`MOD` remains 1000003, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated based on the calculation `numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, `denominator` is updated based on the calculation `denominator = denominator * total_days % MOD`, where i is the final value of the loop variable, and `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`.**
