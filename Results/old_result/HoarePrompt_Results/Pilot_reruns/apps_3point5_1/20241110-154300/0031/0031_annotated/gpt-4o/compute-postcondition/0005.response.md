Example Answer:
`numerator` is assigned the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `MOD` remains 1000003, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is 1.
Output State: **`MOD` remains 1000003, `n` and `k` remain unchanged, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is 1**
