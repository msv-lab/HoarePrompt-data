The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input and a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum absolute difference between 0 and the index of the minimum and maximum values in the list, and between `n - 1` and the index of the minimum and maximum values. The function prints the maximum calculated value. The code operates under the constraint that 2 <= n <= 100, and the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. The function does not return any specific value.
