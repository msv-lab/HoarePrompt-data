Example Answer:
`dist1` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, where `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`. The value of `max_pos` is dependent on the input `n` and the list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of `n` in list `a`**
