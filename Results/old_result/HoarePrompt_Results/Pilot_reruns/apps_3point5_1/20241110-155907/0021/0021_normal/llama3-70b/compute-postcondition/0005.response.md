Example Answer:
The variable `min_dist` is assigned the minimum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and `posn` minus 1, and `n` minus 2. The variables `n`, `a`, `pos1`, `posn`, and `max_dist` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in list `a`**
