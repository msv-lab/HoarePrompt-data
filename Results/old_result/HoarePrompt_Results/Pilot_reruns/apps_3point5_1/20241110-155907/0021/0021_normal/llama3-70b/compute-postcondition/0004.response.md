Example Answer:
The code calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in the list `a`. The maximum distance is determined by taking the absolute difference between `pos1` and `posn`, subtracting 1, and then comparing it to `n - 2`. The output state is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`, and `max_dist` is the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of `n` in list `a`, and `max_dist` is the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in list `a`**
