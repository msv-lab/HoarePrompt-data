Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array, calculating the distances of these elements from the extremes of the array, and then finding the maximum distance possible by swapping these elements. The logic used in the program is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
