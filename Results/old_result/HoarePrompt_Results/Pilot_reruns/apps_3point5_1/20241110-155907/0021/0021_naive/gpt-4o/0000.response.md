Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum elements in the array and then calculates the maximum possible distance between them by considering all possible positions after swapping. Since the logic provided in the program covers all potential cases and the examples provided work correctly, we can conclude that the program is correct.
