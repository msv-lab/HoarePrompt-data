Example Answer:
max_distance is assigned the maximum value among dist1, dist2, dist3, and dist4. 
dist1 is abs(n - 1), dist2 is 0, dist3 is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1 in list a, and dist4 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos. 
Therefore, max_distance will be the maximum value among abs(n - 1), 0, the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1 in list a, and the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos.
Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), min_pos is the index of 1 in list a, max_pos is n-1, dist1 = abs(n - 1), dist2 is 0, dist3 is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1 in list a, dist4 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos, max_distance is the maximum value among dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4**
