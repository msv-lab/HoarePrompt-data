Correctness: False

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The annotations correctly point out that the code does not handle cases where the values 1 and `n` do not exist in the list `a`, potentially leading to a `ValueError` when trying to find their indices. This means that if the minimum or maximum value is missing from the list, the code will not work correctly. For example, if the list `a` does not contain the value 1 or the value `n`, the code will raise a `ValueError` when trying to find their indices, which is not in line with the problem description. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
