Example Answer:
`dist4` is assigned the value `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`, where `n` is the input integer, `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list `a`. The other variables `a`, `min_pos`, `max_pos`, `dist1`, `dist2`, and `dist3` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), min_pos is the index of 1 in list a, max_pos is n-1, dist1 = abs(n - 1), dist2 is 0, dist3 is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1 in list a, and dist4 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos.
Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n (inclusive), min_pos is the index of 1 in list a, max_pos is n-1, dist1 = abs(n - 1), dist2 is 0, dist3 is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of 1 in list a, and dist4 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos**
