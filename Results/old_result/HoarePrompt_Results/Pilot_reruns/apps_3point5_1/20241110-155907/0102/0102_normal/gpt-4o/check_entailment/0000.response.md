Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly maps an integer score to its English word representation. It handles all cases within the range of 0 to 99 as described in the problem. The function `func_1` returns the appropriate string representation based on the input integer `n`. It considers cases where `n` is between 0 and 9, between 11 and 19, and between 10 and 99. The logic provided in the code aligns with the problem description, providing the correct output for all potential cases. The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implemented, covering all scenarios within the specified range.
