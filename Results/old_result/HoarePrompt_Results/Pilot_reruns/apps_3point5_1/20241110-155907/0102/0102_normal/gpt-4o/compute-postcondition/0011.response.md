The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. After executing the function body, the function returns a string representation based on the value of `n` as follows:
- If 0 <= n <= 9, the function returns the string representation of the number at index `n` in the `ones` list.
- If 11 <= n <= 19, the function returns the string representation of the number at index n - 10 in the `teens` list.
- If 10 <= n <= 99 and n is divisible by 10, the function returns the string representation of the number at index n // 10 in the `tens` list.
- If 10 <= n <= 99 and n is not divisible by 10, the function returns the concatenation of the string representation of the number at index n // 10 in the `tens` list, followed by a hyphen and the string representation of the number at index n % 10 in the `ones` list. This ensures the correct string representation is returned for each case when `n` is within the range of 0 to 99.
Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99 and returns the appropriate string representation based on the value of n as described above.**
