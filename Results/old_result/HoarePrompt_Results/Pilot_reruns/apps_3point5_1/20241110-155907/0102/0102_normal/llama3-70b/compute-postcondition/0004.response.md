Example Answer:
The code prints the value of the element at index `s` in the list `ones`. The value of `s` is an integer between 0 and 99. The list `ones` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, ones is unchanged.
Output State: **s is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, ones is unchanged**
