Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, ones is unchanged. If s < 20, the program prints the corresponding value from the teens array based on s. If s is greater than or equal to 20, the program prints the concatenation of the corresponding value from the tens array with the value from the ones array separated by a hyphen if s is not a multiple of 10.***
