Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description for all potential cases within the specified range of 0 to 99. The function `func_1` handles the conversion of an integer score to its corresponding word representation, following the rules outlined in the problem description. The code uses lists to store the words for ones, teens, and tens, and based on the value of the input integer `n`, it returns the appropriate word representation. The annotations also confirm that the code covers all possible scenarios within the given range and accurately describes the behavior of the function. Since the code and the annotations align with the problem description and cover all cases, the correctness of the code is true.
