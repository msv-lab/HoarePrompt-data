Example Answer:
The function returns the value at the index `n` in the list `ones`. Since `n` ranges from 0 to 99, the value returned will depend on the specific content of the list `ones`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99**
