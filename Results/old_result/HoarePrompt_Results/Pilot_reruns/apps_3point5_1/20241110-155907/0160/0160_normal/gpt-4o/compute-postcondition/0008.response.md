Postcondition: ***`divisors` is an empty set initially. `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. `i` starts at 1 and ranges from 1 to int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1, where `i` is incremented by 1 for the next iteration. After the execution of the if block, `divisors` contains all the divisors of `x` up to its square root, including the result of x divided by i. This accounts for the case where x is divisible by i without remainder, ensuring all divisors are correctly added to the set.***
