According to the code, the loop will execute as long as N is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, gcd is assigned the value of the first integer in the list A, so it needs to be adjusted to the first integer in the list A is the gcd value. Additionally, for the loop to execute, N needs to be greater than 1 and i needs to start at 1.
State: **List A contains N integers ranging from 1 to 10^6, gcd is assigned the value of the first integer in the list A, N is greater than 1, i is 1**
