Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `lst`, which is necessary for finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. The function `func_2` calculates all the divisors of the sum of elements in A up to its square root, which is used to check if a divisor satisfies the condition for all elements in A. The main function then iterates over the divisors and checks if the divisor can divide every element of A after the operations. If it can, the divisor is printed as the maximum possible positive integer. The code handles the constraints and accurately solves the problem for the given input and description. No edge cases are found that the code does not handle.
