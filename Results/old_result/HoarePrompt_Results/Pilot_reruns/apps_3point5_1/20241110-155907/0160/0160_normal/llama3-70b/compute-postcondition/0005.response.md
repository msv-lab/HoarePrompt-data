According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than 1 and `i` is incremented by 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted by incrementing it by 1, and `N` needs to be adjusted to ensure that `i` is still less than `N`.
State: **List A contains N integers ranging from 1 to 10^6, gcd is updated based on calculations, N is greater than 2, i is incremented by 2**
