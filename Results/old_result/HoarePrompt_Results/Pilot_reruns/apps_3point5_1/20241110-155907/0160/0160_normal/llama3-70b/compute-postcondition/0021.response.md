Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the greatest common divisor of all integers in list `A` divided by 2 and 1 if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `N` is greater than 1, `i` is 2, `gcd` is greater than 1, `math` is defined, and `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` value and 2. All edge cases are handled by updating `max_divisor` accordingly based on the conditions specified in the precondition.***
