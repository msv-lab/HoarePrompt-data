Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle the case where the input x in function func_2 is not a positive integer. This violates the problem description which states that x should be a positive integer. Additionally, the reverse sorting of divisors in func_2 is not explicitly done in the code, which could potentially lead to incorrect results if the divisors are not properly sorted. Overall, the code does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making it incorrect.
