Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` already contains at least one divisor of `x`, and `i` is within the range from 1 to the square root of `x` incremented by 1. After the addition, the set `divisors` now contains the updated list of divisors of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing the updated list of divisors of `x`, `i` is within the range from 1 to the square root of `x` incremented by 1.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing the updated list of divisors of `x`, `i` is within the range from 1 to the square root of `x` incremented by 1**
