Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` is an integer between 0 and 8. The value of `k` determines the value of `x`, as `10 ** 0 = 1`, `10 ** 1 = 10`, `10 ** 2 = 100`, and so on up to `10 ** 8`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 0 and 8, and `x` is a power of 10 based on the value of `k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is an integer between 0 and 8, `x` is a power of 10 based on the value of `k`**
