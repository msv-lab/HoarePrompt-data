The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, the function calculates the multiplier based on the value of `k`, where the multiplier is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. The function then multiplies `n` by the calculated multiplier and returns the result as `x`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculate the multiplier based on `k`, multiply `n` by the multiplier, and return the result as `x`.
