According to the code, the loop will execute again if the condition `n % x != 0` is true. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` needs to be adjusted such that the new value of `n` when increased by 1 is divisible by `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **x is a different positive integer between 1 and 100,000,000, n is increased by 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
