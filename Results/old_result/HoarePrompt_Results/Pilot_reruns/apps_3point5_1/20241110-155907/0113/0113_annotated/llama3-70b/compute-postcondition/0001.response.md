Example Answer:
The variable `x` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` can be any value between 0 and 8. Therefore, the value of `x` will be 10^0 to 10^8, which is 1 to 100,000,000. The states of other variables are not affected.
Output State: **x is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000,000, n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
