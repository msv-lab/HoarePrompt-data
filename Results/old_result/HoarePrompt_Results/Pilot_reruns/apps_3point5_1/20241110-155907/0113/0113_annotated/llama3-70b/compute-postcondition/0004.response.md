Example Answer:
`n` is increased by 1, where the previous value of `n` was a positive integer between 1 and 1,000,000,000. The value of `k` and `x` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: x is a different positive integer between 1 and 100,000,000, n is increased by 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
Output State: **x is a different positive integer between 1 and 100,000,000, n is increased by 1, k is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
