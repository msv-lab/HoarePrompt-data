Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints mention that if there are no bus routes, the code should print -1 as the earliest time. However, the code does not handle this case as it will always print the index of the bus route Serval will use. Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem.
