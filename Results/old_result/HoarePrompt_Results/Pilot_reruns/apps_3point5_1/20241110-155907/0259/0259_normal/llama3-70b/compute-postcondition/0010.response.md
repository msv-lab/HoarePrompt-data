Example Answer:
A new tuple (s, d) is appended to the list buses. The previous values of variables n and t are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer + 2, t is a positive integer, buses contains a new tuple (s, d).
Output State: **n is a positive integer + 2, t is a positive integer, buses contains a new tuple (s, d)**
