Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is updated to the minimum of all `wait_time` values encountered. `chosen_route` is updated to the index of the route with the updated minimum `wait_time`. `n` remains greater than 1. `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]` for the next iteration. If `s_i >= t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all edge cases and summarizes the state of the program variables after the if-else block executes.***
