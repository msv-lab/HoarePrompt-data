Example Answer: 
`wait_time` is calculated based on the formula provided. The variables `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are not defined in the initial state, so their values are unknown. Since `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, and `n` is greater than 0, their values are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the formula provided**
