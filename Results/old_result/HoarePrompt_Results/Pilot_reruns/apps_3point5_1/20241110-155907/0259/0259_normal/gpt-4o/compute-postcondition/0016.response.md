Example Answer: 
`wait_time` is calculated using the formula `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The initial state does not provide the values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`, so the exact value of `wait_time` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]` for the next iteration.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]` for the next iteration**
