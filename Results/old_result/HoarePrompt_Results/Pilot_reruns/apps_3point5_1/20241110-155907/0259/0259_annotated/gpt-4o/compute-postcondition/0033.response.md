Output State: 
After the loop executes, `min_wait_time` will contain the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions specified in the program fragment. `chosen_route` will be set to the index of the chosen route plus 1. `i` will be equal to n - 1, `s_i` will be the source of the last tuple in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` will be the destination of the last tuple in `bus_routes`. The `wait_time` will be updated according to the specific calculation rules provided, covering scenarios where `s_i >= t`, `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, and the general case where `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop will not execute, and `min_wait_time` will remain positive infinity, and `chosen_route` will remain -1. This ensures all possible scenarios and edge cases related to the bus route wait time calculation are covered.
