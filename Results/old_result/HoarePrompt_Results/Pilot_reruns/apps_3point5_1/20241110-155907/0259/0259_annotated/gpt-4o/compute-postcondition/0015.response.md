Example Answer: 
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value 0. This initialization does not affect any of the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is updated to the minimum wait time calculated, chosen_route is set to the index of the chosen route plus 1, i is incremented by 1, s_i is the source of the next tuple in bus_routes, d_i is the destination of the next tuple in bus_routes, wait_time is 0.
