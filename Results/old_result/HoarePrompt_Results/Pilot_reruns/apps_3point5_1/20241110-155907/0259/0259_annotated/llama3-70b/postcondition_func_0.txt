The function `func` reads input for the number of buses and a time value, then reads pairs of integers representing the start time and interval for each bus. It calculates the remainder of the time difference between the input time and the start time for each bus, finds the minimum remainder, and prints the index of the corresponding bus. If the number of buses is less than 1 or greater than 100, no calculations are performed. The function does not explicitly return any value.
