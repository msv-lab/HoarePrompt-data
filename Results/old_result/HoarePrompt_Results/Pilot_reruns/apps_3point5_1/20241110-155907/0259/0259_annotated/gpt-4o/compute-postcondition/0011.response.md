Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples. min_wait_time is updated to the minimum wait time calculated based on the conditions specified in the program fragment. chosen_route is set to the index of the chosen route plus 1. i remains as 0, s_i is the source of the first tuple, d_i is the destination of the first tuple. The wait_time is updated according to the specific calculation rules provided, ensuring all edge cases are covered.***
