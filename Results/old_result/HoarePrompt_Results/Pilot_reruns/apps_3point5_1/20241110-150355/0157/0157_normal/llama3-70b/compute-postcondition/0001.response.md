Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state has `a` assigned the value of an input integer. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is assigned the value of an input integer, `b` is also assigned the value of an input integer.
Output State: **`a` is assigned the value of an input integer, `b` is also assigned the value of an input integer**
