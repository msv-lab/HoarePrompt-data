The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the preconditions that are stated. The function returns a message based on the following conditions:
- Case 1: If the sum of a, b, and c is greater than 100, the function returns "Sum is greater than 100."
- Case 2: If the sum of a, b, and c is less than or equal to 100, the function returns "Sum is less than or equal to 100."
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to check the sum of integers a, b, and c and return a message based on whether the sum is greater than 100 or not.
