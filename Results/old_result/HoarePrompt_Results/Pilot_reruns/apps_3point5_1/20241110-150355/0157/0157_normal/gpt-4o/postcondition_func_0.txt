The function `func` takes three integer inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`, where `a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, and `c` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be bought based on the minimum of `a`, `b` divided by 2, and `c` divided by 4. Then, it calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the maximum lemons with 1, 2, and 4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits. The function does not have a return value. However, the code does not handle any potential errors or edge cases such as invalid input types or negative numbers.
