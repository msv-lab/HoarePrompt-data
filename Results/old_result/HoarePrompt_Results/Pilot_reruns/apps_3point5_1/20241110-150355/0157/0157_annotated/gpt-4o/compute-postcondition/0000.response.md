Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: a is an input integer, b and c are positive integers such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000.
Output State: **a is an input integer, b and c are positive integers such that 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000**
