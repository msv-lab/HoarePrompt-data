Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program iterates through each character of the alphabet and checks if that character is present in the input string 's'. If it is present, it appends that character to the result string 'res' and replaces the character in 's' with the next character in alphabetical order. 
After iterating through all characters in the alphabet, if the length of the result string 'res' is 26, then it means that all characters from 'a' to 'z' were found in the input string 's' and replaced accordingly, so it prints the result string. Otherwise, it prints -1.
The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases as described.
