Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so after execution, `j` increases by 1. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 2, and `j` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 2, and `j` is increased by 1**
