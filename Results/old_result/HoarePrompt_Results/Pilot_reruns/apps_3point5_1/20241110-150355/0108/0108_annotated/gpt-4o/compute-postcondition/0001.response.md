Example Answer:
The variable `target` is assigned a string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The variable `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5. The assignment of `target` does not affect the state of `s`, so the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
