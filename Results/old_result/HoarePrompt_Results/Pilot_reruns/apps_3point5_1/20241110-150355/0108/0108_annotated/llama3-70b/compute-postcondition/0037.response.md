Output State: **If `s` is not empty and `alphabet` is not empty, `res` will contain all the characters from `alphabet` that are found in `s` in the order they appear, `s` will have the original string with the first occurrence of each character in `alphabet` replaced by the next character in the alphabet until no characters in `alphabet` are found in `s`. If `s` becomes empty or `alphabet` is fully processed, the loop will stop. If `s` is empty or `alphabet` is empty at the beginning, the loop will not execute and `res` will remain empty.**
