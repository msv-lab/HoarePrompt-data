According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `char` is in `s`, then `res` contains the added character `char`. If `char` is not in `s` or `s` becomes empty at any point, the loop will not execute further. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` should be the next character in `alphabet` that is in `s` and `s` should not become empty.
State: **If `char_next` is in `s`, then `res` contains the added character `char_next`**
