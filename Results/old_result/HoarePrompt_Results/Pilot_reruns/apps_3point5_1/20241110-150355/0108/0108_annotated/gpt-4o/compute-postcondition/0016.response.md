The loop iterates through the string `s` and compares each character with the corresponding character in the `target` string. The loop stops when either `i` reaches the length of `s` or `j` reaches the target length of 26.

If `s` contains all the characters in `target` in the same order, `j` will reach 26, and `i` will reach the length of `s`. If `s` does not contain all the characters in `target`, the loop will stop when reaching the end of `s` or `target`.

Output State: **If `s` contains all characters in `target` in the same order, `i` is the length of `s`, `j` is 26. If not, `i` is the length of `s` or `j` is the target length, whichever is reached first.**
