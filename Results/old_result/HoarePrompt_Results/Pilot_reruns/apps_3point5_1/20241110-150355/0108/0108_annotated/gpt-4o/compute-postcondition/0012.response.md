Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 3, and if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1, `i` is less than the length of `s`, and `j` is less than the length of `target`.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 3, and if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1, `i` is less than the length of `s`, and `j` is less than the length of `target`**
