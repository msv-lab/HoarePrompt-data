Example Answer:
The letter 'char' in the string 's' is replaced with the next alphabetical letter. The replaced letter is stored in 'res'. The 'char' variable is updated to the last replaced letter. The 'alphabet' remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: 's' contains the next alphabetical letter after the current value of 'char', 'alphabet' remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 'char' is the last replaced letter.
Output State: **'s' contains the next alphabetical letter after the current value of 'char', 'alphabet' remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 'char' is the last replaced letter**
