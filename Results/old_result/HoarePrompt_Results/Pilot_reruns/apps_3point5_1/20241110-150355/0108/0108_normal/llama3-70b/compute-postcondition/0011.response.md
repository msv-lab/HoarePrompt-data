The `char` variable is replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence in the string `s` only once. In this case, since `char` is 'b', it will be replaced by 'c' in `s`. After execution, the new value of `s` is 'bcr'. All other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is 'bcr', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aab', `char` is 'b'**
