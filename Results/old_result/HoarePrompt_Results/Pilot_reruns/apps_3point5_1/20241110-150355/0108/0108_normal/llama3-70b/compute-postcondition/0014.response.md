According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable 's' containing 'char' at least once. If 's' contains 'char' at least once, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, if 's' contains 'char' at least once, then 's' will have 'char' replaced by its next alphabetical letter, 'alphabet' remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 'char' is the last replaced letter. If 's' does not contain 'char', the loop does not execute, 'alphabet' remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' is empty, 'char' is 'a'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, 's' needs to contain the next alphabetical letter after the current value of 'char'.
State: **If 's' contains the next alphabetical letter after the current value of 'char', then 's' will have the next letter replaced by its next alphabetical letter, 'alphabet' remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 'char' is the last replaced letter. If 's' does not contain 'char', the loop does not execute, 'alphabet' remains 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', 'res' is empty, 'char' is the next alphabetical letter after the current value of 'char'**
