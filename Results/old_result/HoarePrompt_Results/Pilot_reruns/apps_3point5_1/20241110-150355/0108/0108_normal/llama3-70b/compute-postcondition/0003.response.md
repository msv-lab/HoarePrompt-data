According to the code, the for loop will iterate over each character in the string 'alphabet'. The loop will execute as long as there are characters left in 'alphabet' to iterate over. 

To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is a string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
