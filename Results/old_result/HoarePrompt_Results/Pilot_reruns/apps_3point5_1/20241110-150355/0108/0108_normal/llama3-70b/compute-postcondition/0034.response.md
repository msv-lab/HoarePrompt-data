According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of 'char' in the string 's'. If 'char' is present in 's', the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if 'char' is present in the updated 's', then the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **If 'char' is present in the updated 's', then 'res' contains the concatenation of all replaced 'char' values in order, 's' contains the updated string with the replaced 'char', 'char' is the last replaced letter and is updated in 's'**
