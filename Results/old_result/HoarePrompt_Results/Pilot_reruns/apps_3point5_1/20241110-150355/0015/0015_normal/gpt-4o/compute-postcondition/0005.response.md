Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from splitting the input. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO'. This ensures that the program handles cases where the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, printing 'YES'. For all other cases, including when the condition is not met, the program prints 'NO'.***
