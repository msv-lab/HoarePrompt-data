Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. 
1. When the difference between neighboring elements is 0 (c=0), if the first element of the sequence is equal to Vasya's favorite number, then it prints "YES", otherwise "NO". This is correctly handled by the code.
2. When the difference between neighboring elements is not 0 (c!=0), if the favorite number is reachable from the first element of the sequence by adding multiples of the difference, then it prints "YES", otherwise "NO". This condition is also correctly handled by the code.
3. All edge cases, such as negative numbers and large numbers within the given constraints, are considered in the code and produce the correct output.
