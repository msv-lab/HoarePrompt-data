Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'NO' to the console. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input, and the print statement does not affect their values. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on user input**
