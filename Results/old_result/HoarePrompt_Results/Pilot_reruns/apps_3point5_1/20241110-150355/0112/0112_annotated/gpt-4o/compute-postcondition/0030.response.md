The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a list of integers. The function iterates through the elements of the list and checks if the corresponding cube face has been used and if the digit is in that cube face. If a suitable cube face is found, the function sets certain variables and breaks the loop. If no suitable cube face is found after iterating through all elements, the function returns False.

In Case 1, if the loop does not execute due to certain conditions, all variables retain their initial states. If the loop executes, `found` is False and `digits` may have at least one more element to iterate over.

In Case 2, if the loop does not execute, all variables retain their initial states. If the loop executes, `found` is False and `digits` may have at least one more element to iterate over. The function returns True if the loop executes.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a list of integers `num` and determine if the elements in the list can form a valid number based on certain conditions. If the conditions are met, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
