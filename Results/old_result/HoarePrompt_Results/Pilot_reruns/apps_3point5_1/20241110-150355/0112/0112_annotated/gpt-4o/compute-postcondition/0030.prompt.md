You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **
```
def can_form_number(num):
```
Output: Case_1: Output State: 
The loop iterates through `n` times, checking if the `i-th` cube face has been used and if the `digit` is in that cube face. If the condition is met, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. If the loop completes without finding a suitable cube face, `found` remains False. If the loop does not start due to `n` being 0 or `digits` being empty, all variables retain their initial states. In all cases, if `found` is False, the function returns False.

If there are no cube faces or digits to iterate over, the loop does not execute and all variables retain their initial states.

Output State after the loop executes:
- If the loop does not execute: All variables retain their initial states.
- If the loop executes: `found` is False. `digits` may have at least one more element to iterate over.

Case_2: Output State: 
- If the loop does not execute: All variables retain their initial states.
- If the loop executes: `found` is False. `digits` may have at least one more element to iterate over.
- The function returns True.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
