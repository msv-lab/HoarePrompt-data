According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `digits`. If there are more elements in the `digits` to iterate over, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False. To execute the loop one more time, `digits` should have at least one more element to iterate over.
State: **`found` is False, `digits` has at least one more element to iterate over**
