Example Answer:
The `digits` set is updated with string representations of each `digit` in the `cube` set. Since `cube` is a non-empty set, the `digits` set will contain string representations of digits from the next cube. The previous values of the variables are not directly affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the next `cube` in the `cubes` set, `cubes` is a non-empty set.
Output State: **`digits` is a set containing string representations of digits from the next `cube` in the `cubes` set, `cubes` is a non-empty set**
