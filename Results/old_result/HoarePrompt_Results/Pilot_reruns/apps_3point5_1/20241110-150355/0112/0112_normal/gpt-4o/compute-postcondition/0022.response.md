Postcondition: ***`digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the ith element is set to True if not already used and False otherwise, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True if the condition is met and False otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If `found` is False, the loop does not execute and `found` remains False. If the list `digits` is empty or `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `found` remains False. If none of the conditions in the loop are met, `found` remains False and the loop continues to iterate through the digits.***
