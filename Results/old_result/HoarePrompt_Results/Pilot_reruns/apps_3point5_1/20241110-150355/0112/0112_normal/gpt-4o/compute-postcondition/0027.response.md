According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more digits in the `digits` list. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the ith element is set to True if not already used and False otherwise, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list, `found` is set to False, `n` is greater than or equal to 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the next digit in the list needs to be available and the state of other variables remains the same.
State: **`digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the ith element is set to True if not already used and False otherwise, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list, `found` is set to False, `n` is greater than or equal to 0**
