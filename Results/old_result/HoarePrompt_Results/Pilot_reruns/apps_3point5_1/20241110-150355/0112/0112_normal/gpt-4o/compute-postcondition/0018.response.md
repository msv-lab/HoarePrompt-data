Postcondition: ***`digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list where the ith element is set to True if not already used and False otherwise, `digit` is the next digit in the `digits` list, `found` is True if the condition is met and False otherwise, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is incremented by 1. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop is terminated. All other variables retain their initial values.***
