Example Answer:
The code iterates over each digit in the `cube`, converts it to a string, and updates the `digits` set with the unique string representations of the digits in the `cube`. The previous values of `digits`, `cube`, and `n` are known. After the code execution, the `digits` set will contain unique string representations of all digits in the updated `cube`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n+1` lists of integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the unique string representations of the digits in the updated cube, `cube` is the next cube in the list**
