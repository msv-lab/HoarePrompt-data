Example Answer:
The code iterates over each digit in the first cube in the list `cubes` and converts it to a string before adding it to the set `digits`. Since the cube is the first cube in the list, it affects the set `digits` by updating it with the string representation of each digit in the cube. The initial state has `n` as an input integer, `cubes` as a list of `n` lists of integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` as an empty set, and `cube` as the first cube in the list. After running the code, the set `digits` will contain the unique string representations of the digits in the first cube.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the unique string representations of the digits in the first cube, `cube` is the first cube in the list**
