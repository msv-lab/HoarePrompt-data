Example Answer: 
The variable `digits` is assigned to a list of characters obtained by converting the integer `num` to a string and then to a list. The value of `num` is unknown, so it could be any integer. After execution, the list `digits` will contain each digit of the integer `num` as separate characters. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`.
Output State: **`digits` is a list containing individual digits of the integer `num`**
