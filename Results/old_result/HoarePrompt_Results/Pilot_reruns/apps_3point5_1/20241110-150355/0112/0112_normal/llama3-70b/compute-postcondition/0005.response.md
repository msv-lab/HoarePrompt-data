According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. If there are more cubes in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the unique string representations of the digits in the first cube, `cube` is the first cube in the list. To execute the loop one more time, the `cubes` list must have at least one more cube, so `n` remains the same, but the `cubes` list should have `n+1` lists. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n+1` lists of integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the unique string representations of the digits in the first cube, `cube` is the first cube in the list**
