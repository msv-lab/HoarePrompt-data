According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `cubes`. If there are more cubes left in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n+1` lists of integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the unique string representations of the digits in the updated cube, and `cube` is the next cube in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, the next cube in the list needs to be accessed, so the state that needs to be adjusted is `cube` is the next cube in the list.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of `n+1` lists of integers with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the unique string representations of the digits in the updated cube, `cube` is the next cube in the list**
