Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input of the number of cubes and the faces of each cube.
2. The `can_form_number` function correctly checks if a number can be formed using the given cubes.
3. The main function `func_1` iterates through numbers starting from 1 and checks if each number can be formed using the cubes. It returns the maximum number that can be formed.
4. The program uses sets to store the faces of each cube, ensuring uniqueness of digits for each cube.
5. The program uses a while loop to find the maximum number that can be formed, which is a valid approach to solving the problem.
