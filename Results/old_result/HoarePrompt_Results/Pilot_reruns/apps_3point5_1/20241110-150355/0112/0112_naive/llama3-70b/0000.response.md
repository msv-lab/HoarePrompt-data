Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input, processes the cubes to determine the maximum number Masha can make, and outputs the result. It considers all the digits on the faces of the cubes and correctly removes '0' if present. The program then concatenates the digits in descending order to form the maximum number possible. Since the program covers all the possible cases and follows the problem description accurately, it is considered correct.
