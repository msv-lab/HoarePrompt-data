Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code accurately implements the problem description by using two functions: `func_1` and `count`. 
2. The `func_1` function calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, modulo `998244353`, by utilizing the `count` function for each value in the range.
3. The `count` function correctly handles the logic of counting the numbers that meet the criteria of having at most `k` different digits.
4. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the state of the program and the purpose of each function, helping to understand the code's functionality.
5. The code passes the provided examples and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
