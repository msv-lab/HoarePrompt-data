Example Answer:
The value of dp[n, k] is updated by adding the calculated value. The initial value of dp[n, k] is 900000000. The calculation involves powers of 10 and the values of i and k. After the calculation, the new value of dp[n, k] is the result of the addition. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a new calculated value, i is 3.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a new calculated value, i is 3**.
