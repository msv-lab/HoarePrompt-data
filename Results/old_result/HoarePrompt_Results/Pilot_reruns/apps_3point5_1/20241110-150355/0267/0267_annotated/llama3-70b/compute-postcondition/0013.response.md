Output State: **If k is greater than 1, then after the loop executes, dp is a dictionary with (n, k) having a value calculated based on the loop logic, n and k remain positive integers, and i is the value that the loop ends with. If k is 1 or less, the loop does not execute, and dp retains its initial value of 9.**
