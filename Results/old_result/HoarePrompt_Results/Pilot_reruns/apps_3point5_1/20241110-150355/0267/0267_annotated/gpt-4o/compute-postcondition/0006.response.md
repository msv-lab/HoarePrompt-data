Postcondition: ***total_sum is updated based on the formula (total_sum + num) % MOD, num is equal to l, and l is less than or equal to r. If func_1(num, k) is true, total_sum is updated as described above. The loop will continue executing as long as l is less than or equal to r. If func_1(num, k) is false, no changes are made to total_sum, and the loop continues until l is less than or equal to r.***
