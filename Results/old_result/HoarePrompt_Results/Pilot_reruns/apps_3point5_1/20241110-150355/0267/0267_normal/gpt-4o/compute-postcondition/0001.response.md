According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `l` and `r`. The loop will execute if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Before the loop starts, `total_sum` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, adjust the states as follows:
State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is equal to `l`**
