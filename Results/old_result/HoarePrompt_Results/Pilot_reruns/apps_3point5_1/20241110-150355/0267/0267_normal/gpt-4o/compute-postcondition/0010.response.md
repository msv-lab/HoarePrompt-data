According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `l` is equal to `r + 1`, `r` and `k` remain unchanged. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `l` needs to be adjusted to `r + 2` to ensure that `num` is less than or equal to `r`. No changes need to be made to `r` and `k`.
State: **`l` is equal to `r + 2`, `r` and `k` remain unchanged**
