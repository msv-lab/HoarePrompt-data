Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer greater than 1, if `k` is equal to 0 then the function returns 0. If `k` is equal to 1 then `dp[n, k]` is 9, otherwise after the loop executes `dp[n, k]` is updated based on the formula provided, `i` is less than `k` and `dp[n, k]` is updated.**
