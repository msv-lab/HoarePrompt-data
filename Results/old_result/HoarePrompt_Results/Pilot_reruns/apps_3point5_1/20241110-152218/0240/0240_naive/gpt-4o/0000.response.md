Correctness: **False**

In the provided program, the function `func_1` is not correctly implemented as it does not handle all potential cases as described in the problem statement. 

One potential case where the program does not work correctly is when the input string `s` contains duplicate characters that are not present in the substring `sub`. In such cases, the program may generate incorrect results as it does not consider all possible permutations of the remaining characters to find the smallest integer `n`. 

For example, if the input is:
```
s = "112233"
sub = "44"
```
The correct output should be:
```
11223344
```
However, the program may not handle this case correctly and produce incorrect results. Therefore, the correctness of the provided program is **False**.
