According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `chars` and `permutations`. In this case, the loop will execute if the `chars` string is not empty. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `chars` is a non-empty string and `sub` is a substring of `chars`.
State: **Precondition**: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing a sequence of digits, `sub` is a substring of `chars`**
