According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `perm` and `chars`. If there are more permutations to iterate through, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the next permutation. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then `candidate` is yielded. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program. Edge cases are handled where the validity of the number is checked before yielding `candidate`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the state should be adjusted such that there are more permutations to iterate through.
State: **`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the next permutation. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then `candidate` is yielded. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program. Edge cases are handled where the validity of the number is checked before yielding `candidate`.**
