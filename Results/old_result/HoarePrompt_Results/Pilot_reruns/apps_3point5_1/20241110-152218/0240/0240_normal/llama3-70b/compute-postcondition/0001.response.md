Example Answer:
`n` is assigned an empty string `''`. This assignment does not affect the initial states of `s`, `t`, and `t_set`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` and `t` are strings, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is an empty string.
Output State: **`s` and `t` are strings, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is an empty string**
