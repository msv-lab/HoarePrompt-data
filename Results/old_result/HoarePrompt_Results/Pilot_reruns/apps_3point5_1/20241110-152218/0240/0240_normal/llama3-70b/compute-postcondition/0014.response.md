Example Answer:
The function returns the integer value of `n`. If none of the characters in `s` are in `t_set`, `n` remains an empty string. If at least one character in `s` is in `t_set`, `n` will contain only those characters from `s` that are in `t_set`. The function will return the integer value of `n`. The return statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: If string `s` is empty or none of the characters in `s` are in `t_set`, `n` remains an empty string. If at least one character in `s` is in `t_set`, `n` will contain only those characters from `s` that are in `t_set`.
Output State: **If string `s` is empty or none of the characters in `s` are in `t_set`, `n` remains an empty string. If at least one character in `s` is in `t_set`, `n` will contain only those characters from `s` that are in `t_set`.**
