Output State: **The loop generates permutations of the characters in the string `chars` and concatenates them to form `candidate`. If `candidate` satisfies the condition specified by `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, then `candidate` is yielded. If there are no valid candidates, there is no change in the program state. If `chars` is an empty string or `sub` is not found in `candidate`, the loop does not execute and no values are yielded.**
