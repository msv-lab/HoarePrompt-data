Example Answer:
The value of `c` is added to the end of the string `n`. The variable `n` was initially an empty string, and `c` was not mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a non-empty string, `t_set` contains unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string with the value of `c` added to the end.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t_set` contains unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string with the value of `c` added to the end**
