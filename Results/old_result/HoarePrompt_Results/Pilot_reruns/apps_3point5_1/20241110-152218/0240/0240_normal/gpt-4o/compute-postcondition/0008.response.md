According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the result of `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` being true. If the function returns true, then the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in `perm`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `candidate` needs to be adjusted to the concatenated string of elements in the next `perm` in the permutations. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the next `perm` in the permutations**
