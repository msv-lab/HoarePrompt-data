Example Answer:
The value of `c`, which is the first character in string `s`, is added to the empty string `n`. Since `n` was initially an empty string and `c` is the first character of `s`, `n` will now hold the value of the first character of `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is not empty, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is a string with the first character of `s`, `c` is the first character in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is not empty, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is a string with the first character of `s`, `c` is the first character in `s`**
