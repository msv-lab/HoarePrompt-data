Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two string parameters `s` and `t`. It then extracts characters from `s` that are also present in `t` and concatenates them with `t` to form a new string `n`. If no matching characters are found, `n` remains empty. Finally, the function returns the integer value of `n`. **

Potential edge cases or missing logic:
- If `s` or `t` are empty strings, the function will still return an integer value of `n`, which might lead to unexpected results.
- The function does not handle cases where the input parameters `s` and `t` contain special characters or numbers, as it specifically looks for characters only.
- If `t` is an empty string, the function will concatenate the characters found in `s` with an empty string, potentially leading to unexpected results.
