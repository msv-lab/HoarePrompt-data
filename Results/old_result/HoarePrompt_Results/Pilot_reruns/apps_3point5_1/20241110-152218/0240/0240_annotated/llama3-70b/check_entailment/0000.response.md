Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes two input strings `s` and `t`, where `s` is the string received by Kate and `t` is the substring of `n` that Vasya remembers. The code then extracts characters from `s` that are also present in `t` and concatenates them with `t` to form a new string `n`, which is the smallest possible initial integer n that Vasya could pass to Kate. The code handles the case where `s` is empty (no digits in `s` match `t`) by returning an empty string, which aligns with the problem description. The annotations correctly describe the logic of the code and the overall functionality of the `func_1` function.
