Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the value of `candidate`, which represents the next permutation of the characters in `chars`. The variables `chars`, `perm`, and `candidate` are not directly affected by the code snippet, so the Output State remains the same.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`**
