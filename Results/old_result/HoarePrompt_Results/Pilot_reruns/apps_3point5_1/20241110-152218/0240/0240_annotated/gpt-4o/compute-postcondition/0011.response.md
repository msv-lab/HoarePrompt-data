Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`. If `candidate` passes the validation check with respect to `sub`, then the generator yields `candidate`.***
