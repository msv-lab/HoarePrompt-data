Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is a key with an incremented value of 1. `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 2, and `color` is the color at index 2 in the `colors` list. If all values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the loop.***
