Postcondition: ***The `window_counts` dictionary contains the key `color` with a value that is either incremented by 1 if `color` was previously present or set to 1 if `color` was not present. `i` remains 0, `n` remains greater than or equal to `i`, `j` remains 2, and `found` is True if all values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`. If `color` was not in `window_counts`, then the value associated with `color` is set to 0 in `window_counts`.***
