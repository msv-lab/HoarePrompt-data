Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each color in the non-empty `colors` list, `colors` is a non-empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` dictionary now contains a key `color` with a value incremented by 1 if `color` was not already present in `window_counts`, `i` is incremented by 1, `found` is True, `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop is terminated. If the condition is not met, the loop continues.***
