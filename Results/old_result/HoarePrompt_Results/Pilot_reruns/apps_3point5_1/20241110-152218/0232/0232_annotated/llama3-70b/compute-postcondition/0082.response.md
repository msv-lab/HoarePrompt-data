Example Answer: 
The variable `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in the list `colors`. The value of `j` is 1, so `color` will be the color at index 1 in the `colors` list. The variables `window_counts`, `i`, and `n` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `j` is 1, and `color` is the color at index 1 in the `colors` list.
Output State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `j` is 1, and `color` is the color at index 1 in the `colors` list**
