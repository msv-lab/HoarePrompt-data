Postcondition: ***`window_counts` dictionary contains the key `color` with a value of 0 if it was not previously present and the value remains incremented by 1 if it was already present. `i` remains 0, `n` is still greater than or equal to `i`, `j` is 1, and `found` is True if all values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`.***
