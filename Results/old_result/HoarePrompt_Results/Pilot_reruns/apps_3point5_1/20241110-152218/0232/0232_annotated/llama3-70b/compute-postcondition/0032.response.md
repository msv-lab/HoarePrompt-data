Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each color in the non-empty `colors` list. `colors` is a non-empty list. `n` is greater than 0. `window_counts` is a dictionary that now contains a key `color` with a value incremented by 1 if `color` was not already present in `window_counts`. `i` is incremented by 1. `found` is True. `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list. If `color` was not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is now set to 0.***
