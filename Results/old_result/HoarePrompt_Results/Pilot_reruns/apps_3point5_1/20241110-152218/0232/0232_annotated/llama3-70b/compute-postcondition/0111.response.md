Output State: **If `colors` is an empty list or `n` is less than or equal to 0, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is False, and `i` is 0. If the loop executes, `color_counts` contains the count of each color in the non-empty `colors` list, `window_counts` has updated color counts, `found` is True if all counts match targets, and `i` is less than `n`. At the end, it prints 'YES' if `found` is True, otherwise 'NO'.**
