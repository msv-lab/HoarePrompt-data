Example Answer:
The variable `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, where `j` is equal to `i`. The value of `i` is 0, so `j` is also 0. Since `colors[j]` is accessed, it depends on the values in the `colors` list at index 0. The output state will be based on the actual value at index 0 of the `colors` list.
Output State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `j` is 0, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[0]` based on the actual value at index 0 of the `colors` list.**
