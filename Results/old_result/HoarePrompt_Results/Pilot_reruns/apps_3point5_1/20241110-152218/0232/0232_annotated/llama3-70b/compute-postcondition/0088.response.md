Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is a key with an incremented value, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `j` is 1, and `color` is the color at index 1 in the `colors` list. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop is broken. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases after the execution of the if statement.***
