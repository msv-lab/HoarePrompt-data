Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary with color counts, `i` remains 0, `n` is still greater than or equal to `i`, `j` represents the index in the range, and `found` is True if the counts match the targets. If the loop does not execute, `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, and `found` is False.**
