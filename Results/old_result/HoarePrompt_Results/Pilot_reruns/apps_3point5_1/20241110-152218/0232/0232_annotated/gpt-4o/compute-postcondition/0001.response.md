Example Answer:
`current_counts` is initialized as a defaultdict with int values. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: desired_counts is a dictionary containing key-value pairs from 1 to m with values from the list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with int values.
Output State: **desired_counts is a dictionary containing key-value pairs from 1 to m with values from the list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with int values**
