According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the loop will execute again if at least one color in current_counts has a value less than the corresponding value in desired_counts. The values of left and right also need to be adjusted for the next iteration.
State: **If at least one color in current_counts has a value less than the corresponding value in desired_counts, `left` will be incremented and `right` will be incremented by 1**
