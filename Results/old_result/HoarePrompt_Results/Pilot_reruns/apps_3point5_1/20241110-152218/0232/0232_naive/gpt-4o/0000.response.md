Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly checks if there exists an interval with the prescribed color counts. It uses a sliding window approach to keep track of the current counts of each color and compares them with the desired counts. The program handles all potential cases where the desired counts are met within a contiguous interval of Jedi Knights. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, making it correct.
