Postcondition: ***`found` remains True, `i` remains 0, `n` remains a positive integer greater than 0 and greater than `i`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the key `color` is updated to the previous value + 1, `j` is incremented by 1, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If all the values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` remains True and the loop is exited.***
