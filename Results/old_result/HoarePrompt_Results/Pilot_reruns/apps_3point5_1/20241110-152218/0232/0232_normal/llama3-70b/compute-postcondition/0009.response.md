Example Answer:
A new key-value pair is added to the `color_counts` dictionary where the key is `color` and the value is 0. This implies that the count of `color` is set to 0 in the `color_counts` dictionary. The other variables `colors` and `counts` remain unaffected by this operation.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 more color left to process, `counts` is a list of integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary with the updated counts of colors where the count of `color` is set to 0**
