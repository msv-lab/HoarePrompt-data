Output State: **`found` is a boolean that is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `i` is 0, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0 and greater than `i`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where `color` is mapped to 1 (if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, its count is set to 1), `j` is equal to `i+1`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i]`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, its count is increased by 1.**
