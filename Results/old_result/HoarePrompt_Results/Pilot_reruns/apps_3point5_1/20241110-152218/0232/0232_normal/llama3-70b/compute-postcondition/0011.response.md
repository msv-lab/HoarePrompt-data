Example Answer:
The count of the color specified by `color` in `color_counts` is incremented by 1. If the color is not already in `color_counts`, its count is set to 0. All other colors in `color_counts` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 more color left to process, `counts` is a list of integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary with the updated counts of colors.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 more color left to process, `counts` is a list of integers, `color_counts` is a dictionary with the updated counts of colors**
