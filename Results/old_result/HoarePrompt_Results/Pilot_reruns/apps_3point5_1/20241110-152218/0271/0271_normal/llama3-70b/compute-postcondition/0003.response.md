Example Answer:
The code calculates n + (10 - n % 10). Since n is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, the result will always be the next multiple of 10 greater than n. For example, if n is 7, the result will be 10. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result is the next multiple of 10 greater than n.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result is the next multiple of 10 greater than n**
