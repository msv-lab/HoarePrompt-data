Example Answer:
The code subtracts the remainder of n divided by 10 from n. Since n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the result will always be a multiple of 10. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result is a multiple of 10.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result is a multiple of 10**
