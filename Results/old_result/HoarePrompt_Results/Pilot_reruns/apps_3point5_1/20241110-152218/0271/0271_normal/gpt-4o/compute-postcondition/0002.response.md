Example Answer:
The value of `result` is calculated as the subtraction of `remainder` from `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9, the value of `result` will also be a non-negative integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9; `result` is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9; `result` is a non-negative integer**
