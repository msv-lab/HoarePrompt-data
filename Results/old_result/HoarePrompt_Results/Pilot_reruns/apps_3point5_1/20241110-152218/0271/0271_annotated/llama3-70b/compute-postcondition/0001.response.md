Example Answer: 
The code simply prints the value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9. The value of `n` is not modified by the print statement. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
