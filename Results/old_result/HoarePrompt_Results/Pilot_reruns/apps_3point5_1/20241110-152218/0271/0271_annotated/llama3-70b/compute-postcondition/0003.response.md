Example Answer:
The code calculates n + (10 - n % 10), where n is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9. This expression effectively rounds n up to the nearest multiple of 10. For example, if n is 25, the result would be 30 (25 + (10 - 25 % 10) = 30). Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result of the expression n + (10 - n % 10).
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result of the expression n + (10 - n % 10)**
