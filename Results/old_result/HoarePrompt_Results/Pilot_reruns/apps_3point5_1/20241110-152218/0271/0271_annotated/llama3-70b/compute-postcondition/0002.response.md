Example Answer: 
The code calculates the remainder of n divided by 10 and then subtracts that remainder from n. Since n is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, the result of n - n % 10 will always be a multiple of 10. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and the result is a multiple of 10.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and the result is a multiple of 10**
