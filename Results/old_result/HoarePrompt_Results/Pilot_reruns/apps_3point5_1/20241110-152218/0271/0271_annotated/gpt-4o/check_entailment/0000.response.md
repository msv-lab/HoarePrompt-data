Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the rounding logic described in the problem description. It takes a non-negative integer `n`, calculates the remainder when divided by 10, and then determines the rounded value by either subtracting the remainder from `n` or adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to `n` based on the value of the remainder.

The annotations provided in the code summarize the state of the program at different points and explain the logic behind the rounding calculation. By analyzing both the code and the annotations, it is evident that the program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description align with the expected output of the program.

Therefore, based on a thorough review of the code, annotations, and problem description, the correctness of the program is deemed to be True.
