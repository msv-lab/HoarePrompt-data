Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x,y,z <= 100. If x is greater than y + z, the program prints '+'. If x is less than y, the program prints '-'. If x equals y, then if z is 0, the program prints '0'. If z is not 0, the program prints '?'. If x does not equal y, the program always prints '?' covering all possible edge cases within the specified integer range.***
