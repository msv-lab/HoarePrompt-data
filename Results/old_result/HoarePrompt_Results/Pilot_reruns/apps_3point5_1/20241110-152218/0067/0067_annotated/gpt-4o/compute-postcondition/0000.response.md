Example Answer: 
`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`, which accepts three inputs separated by spaces and converts them to integers. Since the values need to be non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the state after execution will depend on the input provided. 
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
