Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the problem description. It calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes based on the input values of x, y, and z. Then, it checks the conditions as mentioned in the problem description and prints the appropriate result ('+', '-', or '?'). 

For every potential case mentioned in the problem description, the code provides the correct output. Additionally, the output hints also align with the code logic, confirming that the code works as expected. Hence, the correctness of the program is True.
