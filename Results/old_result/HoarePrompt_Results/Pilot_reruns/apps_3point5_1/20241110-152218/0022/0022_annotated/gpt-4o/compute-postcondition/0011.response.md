Output State: **After the loop executes, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to the number of completed iterations of the loop. If the character at index `i` in `s` does not match the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute.**
