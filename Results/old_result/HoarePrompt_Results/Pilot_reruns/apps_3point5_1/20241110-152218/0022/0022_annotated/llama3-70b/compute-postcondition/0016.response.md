Output State: **If the input string `s` is a palindrome, `is_spalindrome` remains True. If `s` is not a palindrome, `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and the loop breaks. The loop iterates through the first half of the string comparing characters from the beginning and end. The loop does not execute if the length of `s` is less than 2.**
