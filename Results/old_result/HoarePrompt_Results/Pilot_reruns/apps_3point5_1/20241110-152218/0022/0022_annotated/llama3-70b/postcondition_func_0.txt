The function `func` reads a string `s` from user input and determines if it is a palindrome. It iterates through the first half of the string comparing characters from the beginning and end. If the characters do not match, it sets `is_spalindrome` to False and breaks the loop. Finally, it prints 'TAK' if `is_spalindrome` is True (indicating `s` is a palindrome), and 'NIE' otherwise. The function does not accept any parameters. The input string `s` must consist of English letters only and can have a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive.
