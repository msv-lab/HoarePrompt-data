According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is True. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be less than `n // 2`. Since `i` starts from 0, it means the loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than `n // 2 - 1`.
State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is less than `n // 2 - 1**
