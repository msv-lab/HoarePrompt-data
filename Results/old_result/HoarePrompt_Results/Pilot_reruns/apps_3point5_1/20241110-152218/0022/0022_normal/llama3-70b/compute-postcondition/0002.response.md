Example Answer:
The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_spalindrome` is True.
Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_spalindrome` is True**
