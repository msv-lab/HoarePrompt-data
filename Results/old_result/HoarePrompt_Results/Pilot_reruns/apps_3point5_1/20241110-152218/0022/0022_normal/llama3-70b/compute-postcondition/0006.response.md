Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is True. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop. This ensures that the program correctly checks for palindrome conditions within the given string `s` based on the indices `i` and `n`.***
