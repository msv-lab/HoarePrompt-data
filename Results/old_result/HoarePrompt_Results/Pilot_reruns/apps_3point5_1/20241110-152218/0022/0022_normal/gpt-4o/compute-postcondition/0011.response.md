Output State: **`s` is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute.**
