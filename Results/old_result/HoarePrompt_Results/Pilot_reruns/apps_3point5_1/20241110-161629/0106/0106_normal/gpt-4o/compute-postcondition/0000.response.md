Example Answer:
The value of `block` is calculated based on the value of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1` is used to determine the block number. Since all variables are positive integers within the given constraints, the calculation will result in a positive integer block number. Therefore, the Output State is: block is a positive integer.
Output State: **block is a positive integer**
