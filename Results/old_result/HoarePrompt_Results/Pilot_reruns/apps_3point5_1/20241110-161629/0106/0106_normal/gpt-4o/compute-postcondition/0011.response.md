The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, all of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000 and 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k. The function calculates `time_to_target_floor` as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, where `floor_b` is the target floor represented by `b`. 

The function then calculates `total_time` as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, and finally returns `total_time`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept integer parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, calculate the total time taken to reach the target floor `b`, and return this total time.
