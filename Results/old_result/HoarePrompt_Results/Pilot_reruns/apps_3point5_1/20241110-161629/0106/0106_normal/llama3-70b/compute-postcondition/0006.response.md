Example Answer:
`min_block_time` is calculated based on the formula provided. The values of `a_block` and `b_block` are used to determine the minimum block time. The values of `a_floor` and `b_floor` are not used in this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the given formula, `b_floor` is based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, and `min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum time between two blocks.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the given formula, `b_floor` is based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, and `min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum time between two blocks**
