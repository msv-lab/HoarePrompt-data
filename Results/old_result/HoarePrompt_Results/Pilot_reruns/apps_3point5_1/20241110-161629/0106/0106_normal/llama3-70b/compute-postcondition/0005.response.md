Example Answer:
`b_block` is calculated based on the formula provided, where `b` is the input integer, `m` and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000. The previous values of affected variables are: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the given formula, and `b_floor` is based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the given formula, `b_floor` is based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`, and `b_block` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the given formula, `b_floor` is based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`, and `b_block` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`**
