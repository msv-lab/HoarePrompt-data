Example Answer:
`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. The value of `a_floor` is calculated as `(a - 1) % m + 1`. The values of `a`, `m`, and `k` are provided, and the calculation is performed accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers; `a_floor` is the result of the calculation `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated based on the given formula**
