Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given inputs of the number of blocks, floors, apartments per floor, and the locations of Edward and Natasha's apartments. The functions `func_1` and `get_location` work together to determine the optimal path for Edward to take, considering the use of elevator and walking time. The annotations in the code also provide insights into how the variables are calculated and used throughout the program. Additionally, the code handles the specific formula for calculating the total time accurately. As there are no contradicting cases found in the problem description, the code is deemed correct.
