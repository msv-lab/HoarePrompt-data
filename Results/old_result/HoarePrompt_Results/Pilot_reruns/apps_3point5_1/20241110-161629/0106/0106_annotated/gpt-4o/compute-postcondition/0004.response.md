The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. The precondition specifies that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers representing the apartment numbers where 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a != b. The function does not specify the output or return value.
