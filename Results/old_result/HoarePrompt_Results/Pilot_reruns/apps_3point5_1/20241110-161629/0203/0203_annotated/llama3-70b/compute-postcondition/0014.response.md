Example Answer:
`remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is unknown, so after execution, `remocrats` will have increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a non-empty string with at least one more fraction left, `fraction` is the next fraction in `fractions`, `depublicans` and `remocrats` adjusted based on the next fraction in `fractions`, `remocrats` is incremented by 1**
