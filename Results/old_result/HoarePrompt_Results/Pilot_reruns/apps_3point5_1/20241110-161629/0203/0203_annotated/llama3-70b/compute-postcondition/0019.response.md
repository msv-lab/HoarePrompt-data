Example Answer: 
The code prints 'R' but does not affect the state of any variables. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a non-empty string input from the user, `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a non-empty string input from the user, `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0**
