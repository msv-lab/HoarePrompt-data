Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a non-empty string input from the user. If `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is increased by 1 and `remocrats` remains 0. If `fraction` is not 'D', `remocrats` is increased by 1 and `depublicans` remains 0. In both cases, `fraction` remains the first fraction in `fractions`.***
