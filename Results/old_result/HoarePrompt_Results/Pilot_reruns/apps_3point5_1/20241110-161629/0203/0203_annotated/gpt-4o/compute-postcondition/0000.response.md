Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, the output state is `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
