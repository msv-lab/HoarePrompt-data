According to the code, the loop can execute if the `fractions` string is not empty. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that `fractions` is not an empty string. Additionally, since the loop iterates over each `fraction` in `fractions`, the state should reflect the first iteration of the loop. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a non-empty string input from the user, `depublicans` is initialized to 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first fraction in `fractions`**.
