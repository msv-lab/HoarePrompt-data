Example Answer:
`remocrats` is initialized to 0. The value of `remocrats` is directly set to 0, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a string input from the user, `depublicans` is initialized to 0, `remocrats` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a string input from the user, `depublicans` is initialized to 0, `remocrats` is 0**
