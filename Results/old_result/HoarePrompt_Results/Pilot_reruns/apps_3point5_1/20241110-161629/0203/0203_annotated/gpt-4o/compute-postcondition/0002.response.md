Example Answer: 
No variables are affected by this code snippet, as it simply initializes an empty list `d_queue`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list**
