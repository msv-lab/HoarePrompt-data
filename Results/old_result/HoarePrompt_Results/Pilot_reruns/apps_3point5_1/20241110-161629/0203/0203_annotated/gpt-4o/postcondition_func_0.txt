The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the number of employees and a string `votes` of length `n` containing characters 'D' and 'R'. It then processes the votes by assigning employees to either a 'D' or 'R' queue based on their vote. The function simulates a voting process where employees from the 'D' and 'R' queues take turns voting until one queue becomes empty. The winner ('D' or 'R') is determined based on the last employee who voted. The function prints the winning party. If the queues are initially empty, no voting process occurs, and no winner is printed.
