Example Answer:
The input function retrieves a string input from the user and assigns it to the variable `fractions`. The value of `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees and is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a string input from the user.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the total number of employees, `fractions` is a string input from the user**
