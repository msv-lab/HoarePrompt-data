Example Answer:
`r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. The length of `r_queue` decreases by 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `r_index` is the popped value from `r_queue`, and the length of `r_queue` decreases by 1.
Output State: **`n` is the number of employees, `votes` is a string of length n, `r_index` is the popped value from `r_queue`, and the length of `r_queue` decreases by 1**
