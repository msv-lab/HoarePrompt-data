Output State: If `n` is at least 1, votes is a string of length `n`, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' in `votes` with the new appended value if d_index < r_index, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' in `votes` if d_index < r_index, and `r_index` is the first index popped from `r_queue`. If d_index >= r_index, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' in `votes` except the popped one, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' in `votes` with the new appended value of `r_index + n`, and `r_index` is the first index popped from `r_queue`. `d_index` is the first index popped from `d_queue`. After executing the code `r_index` is the first index popped from `r_queue` and `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' in `votes` with the new appended value of `d_index + n`.
