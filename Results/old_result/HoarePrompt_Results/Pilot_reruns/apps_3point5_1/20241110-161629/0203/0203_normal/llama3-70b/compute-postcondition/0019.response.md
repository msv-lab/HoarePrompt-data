Output State: **`n` is an input integer. After the loop executes, `depublicans` will represent the count of 'D' fractions, and `remocrats` will represent the count of non-'D' fractions. If the loop does not execute due to an empty list of fractions, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` will remain 0.**
