Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer. After the if-else block executes, `depublicans` will represent the count of 'D' fractions, and `remocrats` will represent the count of non-'D' fractions. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, 'D' will be printed. Otherwise, 'R' will be printed. If the loop does not execute due to an empty list of fractions, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` will remain 0.***
