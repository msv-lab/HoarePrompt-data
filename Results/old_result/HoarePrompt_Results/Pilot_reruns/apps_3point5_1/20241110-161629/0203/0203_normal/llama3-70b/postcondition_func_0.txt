The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input and then processes a string of fractions, where each character represents an employee as 'D' for depublicans or 'R' for remocrats. The function counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' fractions and prints 'D' if there are more depublicans than remocrats, otherwise it prints 'R'. If the input string is empty, it will print 'R' by default.
