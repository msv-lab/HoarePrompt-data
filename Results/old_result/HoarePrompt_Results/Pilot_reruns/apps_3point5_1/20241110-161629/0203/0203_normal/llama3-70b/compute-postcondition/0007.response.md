Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` and `remocrats` are integers representing the count of 'D' and non-'D' fractions respectively. If the `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is incremented by 1 and `remocrats` remains 0. If the `fraction` is not 'D', `remocrats` is incremented by 1 and `depublicans` remains 0.***
