The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly. However, it implicitly assumes the parameters `n` and `votes` based on the constraints provided. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, and `votes` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' for depublicans and 'R' for remocrats. The function calculates and returns the minimum number of employees that need to be convinced to switch their vote in order to have the majority vote for one party (either 'D' or 'R'). The function does not explicitly return the majority party but simply calculates the minimum number of votes needed to achieve a majority. 

Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the minimum number of employees that need to change their vote to achieve a majority vote for one party among depublicans and remocrats.**
