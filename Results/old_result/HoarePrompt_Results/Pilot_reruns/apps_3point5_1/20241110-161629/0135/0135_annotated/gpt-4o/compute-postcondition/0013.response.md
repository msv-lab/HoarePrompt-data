Output State: If `k` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set. If `k` is greater than 0 and `n` is also greater than 0, the loop checks for duplicate remainders in the set `seen_remainders`. If a duplicate is found, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the loop adds the current remainder to `seen_remainders` until `i` reaches `k + 1. Since the code directly returns 'Yes' without any condition, the output state is not affected by any variable changes.
