Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are input integers with `k` being greater than or equal to 1. `seen` is a set containing the result of `n` modulo `i` for each `i` from 1 to `k+1`, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo 2. If the `remainder` is in the `seen` set, then the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, no action is taken.***
