According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `k` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1` and no other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set and `k` is a positive integer**
