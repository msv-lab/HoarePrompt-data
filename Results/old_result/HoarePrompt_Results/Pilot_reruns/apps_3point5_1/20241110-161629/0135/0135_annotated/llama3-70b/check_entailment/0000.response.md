Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It reads two integers `n` and `k`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k`, and checks if any remainder repeats. If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No'; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of how the code works and the logic behind it. Since there are no examples or cases provided where the code does not work as expected in the problem description, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
