Output State: **If k is at least 1 and n is a non-negative integer, the loop will execute at least once. The loop checks if the remainder of n divided by i is already in the set seen. If it is, 'No' is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, the remainder is added to the seen set. The loop will continue until i reaches k. If k is less than 1 or n is negative, the loop will not execute.**
