Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description. It reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from the input and checks if there are any repeating remainders when `n` is divided by numbers from 1 to `k`. If a repeating remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The program also handles cases where `k` is less than 1 or `n` is negative by not executing the loop. The output hints also agree with the code. Since the program covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement and the output hints align with the code functionality, the correctness is **True**.
