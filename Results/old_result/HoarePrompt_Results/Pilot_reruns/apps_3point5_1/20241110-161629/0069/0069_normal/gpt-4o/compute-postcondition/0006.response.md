Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is 1. Since `index` is 1, the value at that index in the list `data` is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list.
Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list**
