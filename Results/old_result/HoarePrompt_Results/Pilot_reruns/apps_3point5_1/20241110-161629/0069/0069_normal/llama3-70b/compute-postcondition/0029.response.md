Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than 1, _ is 1, n and x are assigned values based on user input, cnt0 and cnt1 are updated counts of '0' and '1' in the user input string, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1, s is the user input string. If the condition (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0 is true, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is printed. This covers all possible scenarios including when the values in the input lead to a division by zero or a negative result.***
