According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the `prefix_balances` list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` needs to be adjusted based on the condition (1 if `s[i - 1] == '0'` else -1). Therefore, for the loop to execute, the following adjustments need to be made:
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` based on the condition (1 if `s[i - 1] == '0'` else -1), `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
