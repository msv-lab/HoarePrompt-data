Output State: **The loop calculates the prefix sum of balances based on the characters in the string `s`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute and update the `prefix_balances` list accordingly. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros.**
