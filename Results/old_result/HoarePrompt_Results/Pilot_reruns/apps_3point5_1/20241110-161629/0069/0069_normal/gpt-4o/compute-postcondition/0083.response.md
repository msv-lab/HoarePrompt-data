Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` based on the condition (1 if `s[i - 1] == '0'` else -1), where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `s[i - 1]`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1**
