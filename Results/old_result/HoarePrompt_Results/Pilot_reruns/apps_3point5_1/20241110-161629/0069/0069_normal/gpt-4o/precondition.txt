**Precondition**: 
- The input consists of T test cases, where T is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 100.
- For each test case:
  - The first line contains two integers n and x, where n is the length of the binary string s and x is the desired balance, such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and -10^9 <= x <= 10^9.
  - The second line contains the binary string s, where each character si is either '0' or '1', and |s| = n.
