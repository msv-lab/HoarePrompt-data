According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1` based on the condition (1 if `s[i - 1] == '0'` else -1). So for the loop to execute one more time, the length of `prefix_balances` needs to be adjusted to `n + 2` since the loop is iterating up to `n + 1`.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 2` based on the condition (1 if `s[i - 1] == '0'` else -1)**
