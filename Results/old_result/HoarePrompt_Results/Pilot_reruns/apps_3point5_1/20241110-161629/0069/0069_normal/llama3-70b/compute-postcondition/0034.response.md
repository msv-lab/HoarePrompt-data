Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a positive integer `T` as input. It then iterates `T` times, taking inputs `n`, `x`, and a string `s` for each iteration. The function calculates the counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s`, computes the balance between the counts, and based on certain conditions, prints different values. If the balance equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)` equals 0, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. The function does not explicitly return a value. If `T` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and no values are assigned.**
