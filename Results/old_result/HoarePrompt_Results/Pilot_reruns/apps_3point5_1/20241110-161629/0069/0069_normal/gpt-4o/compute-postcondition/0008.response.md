Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 2` of the `data` list, which means `s` will be assigned the value of the integer at index 3 of the `data` list. The variables `T`, `index`, `results`, `n`, and `x` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the `data` list, and `s` is the integer value at index 3 of the `data` list.
Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the `data` list, `s` is the integer value at index 3 of the `data` list**
