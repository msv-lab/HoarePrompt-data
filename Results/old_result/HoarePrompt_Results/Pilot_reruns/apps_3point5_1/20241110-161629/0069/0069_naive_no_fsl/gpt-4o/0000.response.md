Correctness: **False**

In the given program, the logic to calculate the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$ is incorrect. 

One of the issues is that the program is checking if the desired balance $x$ is in the list of prefix balances, which is not a correct way to determine the number of prefixes with balance equal to $x$. This can lead to incorrect results.

Additionally, the program is not handling the case of an infinite number of prefixes correctly. The program should output $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such prefixes, but this logic is missing in the implementation.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements specified in the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness of the program **False**.
