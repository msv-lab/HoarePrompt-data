The function func_1 does not accept any parameters. It reads input data representing multiple test cases, each consisting of a binary string, the length of the string, and an integer representing the desired balance. It then calculates the number of steps required to achieve the desired balance in the binary string for each test case and prints the results. The function handles cases where the length of the string is 0 or negative.
