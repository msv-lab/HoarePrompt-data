Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `prefix_balances` is a list that calculates the running balance of '0's and '1's in `s`. If `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` appends -1. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1, and `results` appends 0.***
