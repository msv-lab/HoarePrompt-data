Example Answer:
The value of `index` is used to access the element at index + 1 in the `data` list, which is then converted to an integer and assigned to `x`. The previous values of `data` being a list, `index` being an integer, and `n` being an integer are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list, `index` is an integer, `n` is an integer, and `x` is assigned the integer value at data[index + 1].
Output State: **`data` is a list, `index` is an integer, `n` is an integer, `x` is assigned the integer value at data[index + 1]**
