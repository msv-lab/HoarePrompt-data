Example Answer:
The input from the user is stored in variable `s`. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: T + 1, `n`, `x`, `s` is the user input, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, `balance`, `cnt0`, `cnt1.
Output State: **T + 1, `n`, `x`, `s` is the user input, `cnt0`, `cnt1`, `balance`, `cnt0`, `cnt1**
