**Precondition**: **T is a positive integer representing the number of test cases. For each test case, n is a positive integer representing the length of the binary string s, x is an integer representing the desired balance such that -10^9 <= x <= 10^9. The binary string s consists of 0s and 1s, and the total sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 10^5.**
