According to the code, the loop will execute T times. At the end of the previous iteration, the values of T, n, x, s, cnt0, cnt1, balance are known. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of T needs to be decremented by 1.
State: **T is an integer greater than or equal to 0, n and x are assigned values from the input, s is the input value, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, then n + 1 is printed. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed.**
