Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It is missing the logic to determine if the sequence of operations can be performed using the minimum number of variables. The program only checks if the current number in the sequence can be formed by the sum of two previously assigned numbers, but it does not consider the operations needed to form the current number.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3 6 5
```
The expected output is -1, as it is not possible to perform the sequence of operations with any number of variables. However, the program will incorrectly output 2.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle all potential cases as required by the problem description.
