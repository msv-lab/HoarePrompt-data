Output State: **`assigned` has `a[i]` added to it, `can_form` is True and `m` is incremented by 1 if `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`; `can_form` remains False and `m` is not changed if `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`. The loop will not execute and `can_form` will remain False if `assigned` is empty or `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`.**
