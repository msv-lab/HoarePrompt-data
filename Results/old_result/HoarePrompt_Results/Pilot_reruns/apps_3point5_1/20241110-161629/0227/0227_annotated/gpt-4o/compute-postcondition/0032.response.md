Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first three elements of `a`, `m` is either 1 or 2, `i` is 2, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `x` is the second element of `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the program continues without any changes to the variables.***
