According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `assigned` list. 

To ensure the loop executes, the following adjustments need to be made:
- The `assigned` list should not be empty.
- The value of `x` should be set to the first element of the `assigned` list.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is False, `assigned` is not empty, `x` is the first element of `assigned`**
