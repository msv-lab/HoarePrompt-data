Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
