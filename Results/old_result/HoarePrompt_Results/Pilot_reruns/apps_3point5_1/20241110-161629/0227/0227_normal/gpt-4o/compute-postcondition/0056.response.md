According to the code, the loop will execute again if the loop variable `x` is still within the `assigned` list. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` contains the first 'm+3' elements of list `a`, where `m` is either 2 or 3, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True, `m` is either 2 or 3, `x` is the third element in `assigned`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the `x` should still be within the `assigned` list. Therefore, the states to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
State: **`assigned` contains the first 'm+3' elements of list `a`, where `m` is either 2 or 3, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True, `m` is either 2 or 3, `x` is the fourth element in `assigned`**
