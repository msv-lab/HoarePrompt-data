According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `assigned` has at least 1 element. In the initial state, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, so it already meets the condition. However, since `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `can_form` is False, these states need to be adjusted to ensure the loop execution. Therefore, the adjusted state should be:
State: **`assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is False, `x` is the first element of list `a`**
