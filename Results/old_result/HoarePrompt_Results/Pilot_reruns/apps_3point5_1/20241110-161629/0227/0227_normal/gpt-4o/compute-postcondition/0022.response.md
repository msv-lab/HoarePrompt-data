Output State: **`assigned` contains the first 'm+1' elements of list `a`, `m` is either 1 or 2 based on the original value of `m`, `n` is greater than 1, and `can_form` is True if the condition `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned` for any 'x' in `assigned`. If `can_form` was initially False, then `m` is incremented by 1. If `can_form` was initially True or `assigned` is empty, `m` remains unchanged.**
