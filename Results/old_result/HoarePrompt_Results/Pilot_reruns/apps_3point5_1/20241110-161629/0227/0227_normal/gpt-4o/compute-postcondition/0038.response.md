Output State: **`assigned` contains the first 'm+2' elements of list `a`, where `m` is either 1 or 2. `n` is greater than 1. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the loop is broken. In this scenario, `can_form` becomes True, and the loop is exited. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, no change occurs in the variables, and the loop continues. If `assigned` has less than 'm+2' elements, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False.**
