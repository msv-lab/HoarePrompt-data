Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. Since the list `a` is a list of distinct positive integers, sorting it will rearrange the integers in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: n is a positive integer, a is a list of distinct positive integers. The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.
Output State: **Precondition: n is a positive integer, a is a list of distinct positive integers. The list `a` is sorted in ascending order.**
