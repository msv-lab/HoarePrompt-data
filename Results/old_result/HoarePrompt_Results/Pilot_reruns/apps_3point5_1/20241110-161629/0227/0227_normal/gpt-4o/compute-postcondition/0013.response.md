Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the first two elements of list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True if the condition `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned` after the execution of the if statement. If `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop or if statement is terminated. Otherwise, no changes occur to the variables `assigned`, `m`, `n`, and `can_form`***
