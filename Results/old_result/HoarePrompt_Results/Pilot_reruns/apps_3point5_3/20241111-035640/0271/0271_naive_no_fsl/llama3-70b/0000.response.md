Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description. It checks if the given number `n` already ends with 0, in which case it prints `n`. If `n` doesn't end with 0, it rounds it to the nearest integer that ends with 0. This logic covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement. The program considers both ways (rounding down or rounding up) as correct answers, which is allowed by the problem description.
