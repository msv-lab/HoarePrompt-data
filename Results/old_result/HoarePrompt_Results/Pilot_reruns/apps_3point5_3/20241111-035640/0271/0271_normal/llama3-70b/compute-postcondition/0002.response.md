Example Answer:
The code calculates n - n % 10. This operation computes the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to n. For example, if n is 25, then n - n % 10 would be 25 - 25 % 10 = 25 - 5 = 20. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result of the operation is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to n.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to n**
