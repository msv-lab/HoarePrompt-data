Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer and the value of `remainder` is between 0 and 9. Therefore, `result` will be `n + (10 - remainder)`. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is between 0 and 9, `result` is the sum of `n` and `10 - remainder`**
