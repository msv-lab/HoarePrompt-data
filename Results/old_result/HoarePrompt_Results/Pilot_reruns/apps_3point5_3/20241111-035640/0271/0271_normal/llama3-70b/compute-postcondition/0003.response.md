Example Answer:
The code calculates `n + (10 - n % 10)`, where `n % 10` gives the remainder when n is divided by 10. The result will always be the next multiple of 10 from the given number `n`. For example, if n is 38, then `n % 10` is 8, and `10 - n % 10` is 2, so the output will be 40. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result of the code is the next multiple of 10 from n.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result of the code is the next multiple of 10 from n**
