Example Answer:
The value of `result` is determined based on the initial values of `n` and `remainder`. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is `n - remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is `n + 10 - remainder`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is between 0 and 9, and `result` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is between 0 and 9, and `result` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned**.
