Example Answer:
The code calculates n - n % 10, which means it calculates the value of n with the last digit removed. For example, if n is 456, then n % 10 is 6, so n - n % 10 = 450. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the program prints n with the last digit removed.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the program prints n with the last digit removed**
