The function `func` reads a non-negative integer `n` from user input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, calculates a result. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is `n` minus the remainder; otherwise, the result is `n` plus (10 minus the remainder). The function then prints the calculated result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
