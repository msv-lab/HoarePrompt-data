Example Answer:
The code snippet calculates the result of `n + (10 - n % 10)`. The value of `n % 10` will be the remainder when dividing `n` by 10, so it will always be a number between 0 and 9. When `n` is added to `10 - n % 10`, it effectively rounds `n` up to the next multiple of 10. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result of the expression `n + (10 - n % 10)` is rounded up to the next multiple of 10.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, and the result is rounded up to the next multiple of 10**
