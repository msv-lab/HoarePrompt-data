Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the problem description for every potential case. It takes a non-negative integer `n`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and then rounds `n` to the nearest integer ending with 0. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the remainder from `n`; if the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the difference between 10 and the remainder to `n`. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case. The annotations also accurately describe the functionality of the code without suggesting any edge cases that are not handled by the code.
