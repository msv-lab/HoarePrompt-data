Example Answer:
`remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and `result` is assigned the value of `n` minus `remainder`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer provided by user input, and `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10, the value of `result` is `n` itself. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer assigned by user input, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and `result` is `n`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer assigned by user input, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and `result` is `n`**
