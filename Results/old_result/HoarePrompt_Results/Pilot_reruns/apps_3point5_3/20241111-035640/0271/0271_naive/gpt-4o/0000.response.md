Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program takes an integer input 'n' and rounds it to the nearest integer ending with zero. It correctly calculates the remainder when 'n' is divided by 10 and then based on the remainder, it either subtracts the remainder or adds the difference from 10 to 'n' to round it to the nearest integer ending with zero. The logic provided covers all possible cases and the program produces the correct output for all given examples in the problem description. Since all the cases provided in the problem description are working as expected, the program can be considered correct.
