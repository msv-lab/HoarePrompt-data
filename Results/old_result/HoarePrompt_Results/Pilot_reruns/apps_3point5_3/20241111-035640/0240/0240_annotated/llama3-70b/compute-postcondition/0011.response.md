According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the characters in the string `s`. If there are more characters left in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` has more characters left, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` contains the original value of `n` followed by the value of `c` if `c` is found in `t_set`. Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is the fact that there is one less character in `s`.
State: **`s` has more characters left, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` contains the original value of `n` followed by the value of `c` if `c` is found in `t_set**`.
