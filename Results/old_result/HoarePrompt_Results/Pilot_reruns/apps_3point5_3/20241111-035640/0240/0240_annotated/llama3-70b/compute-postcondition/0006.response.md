Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is increased by the value of `c`, but the previous value of `n` and `c` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `s` has more characters left, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is the character `c` if `c` is present in `t_set`.
Output State: **`s` has more characters left, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is the character `c` if `c` is present in `t_set`**
