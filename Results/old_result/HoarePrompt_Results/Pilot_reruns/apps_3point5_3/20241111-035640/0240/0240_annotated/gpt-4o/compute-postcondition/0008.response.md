According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `perm` variable, which is the next permutation of `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the characters of the next permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the function `is_valid_number` with respect to the state of `sub`, then the generator yields `candidate`.

To execute the loop one more time, the `perm` variable should be the next permutation after the current `perm`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits received by Kate, `perm` is the next permutation after the current `perm`, `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the characters of this new `perm`**
