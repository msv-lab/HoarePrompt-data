Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the value of `candidate`, which is a string obtained by joining the characters of the next permutation of `chars`. Since the initial state specifies that `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is obtained by joining the characters of `perm`, the output state is as follows:
Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits received by Kate and is non-empty, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the characters of the next permutation of `chars`**
