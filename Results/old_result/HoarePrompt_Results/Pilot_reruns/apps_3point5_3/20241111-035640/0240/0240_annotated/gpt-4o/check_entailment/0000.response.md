Correctness: **False**

The code is incorrect because the `is_valid_number` function does not fully perform the intended validation as mentioned in the annotations. It only checks if the substring `sub` is present in the string `num_str` and if the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`, which is a value not defined or calculated within the function. This means that the program may not always output the smallest possible initial integer `n` as required by the problem description.
