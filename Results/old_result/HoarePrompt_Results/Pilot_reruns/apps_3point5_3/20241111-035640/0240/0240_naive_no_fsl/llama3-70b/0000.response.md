Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes in the string received by Kate and the substring that Vasya remembers. It then iterates through the string and only appends the characters that are in the remembered substring to the new string "n". Finally, it appends the remembered substring "t" to the end of the new string "n" and returns the integer value of "n". The program follows the problem description accurately and provides the smallest possible initial integer "n" based on the remembered substring. The logic seems correct and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
