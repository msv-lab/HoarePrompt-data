Functionality: **The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars`, a string of digits representing a number, and `sub`, a string of digits representing a substring of the number. It then generates permutations of the characters in `chars`, concatenates them into a candidate number, and checks if the candidate number is valid with `sub` as a substring. If valid, it yields the candidate number. If either `chars` or `sub` is an empty string, the function does not generate any candidates. The function does not have a specified return value or output description provided.**
