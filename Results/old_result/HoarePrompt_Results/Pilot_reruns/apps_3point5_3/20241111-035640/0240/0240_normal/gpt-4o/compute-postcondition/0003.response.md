Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string of digits representing a number with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string of digits representing a substring of the number with at least 1 digit, and `candidate` is a string representing the concatenated permutations of the characters in `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` as a substring, then the code yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program.***
