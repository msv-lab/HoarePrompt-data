The function func_1 accepts two string parameters s and sub. It updates remaining_chars based on the subtraction of corresponding values in sub_counter, assigns possible_numbers the result of generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub), and returns the smallest number from possible_numbers. The function does not handle cases where sub_counter contains elements not present in s_counter, which could lead to unexpected results.
