Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100; `min_upvotes` and `min_downvotes` are integer values based on the input; `max_upvotes` is calculated as the sum of `x` and `z`, and `max_downvotes` is calculated as the sum of `y` and `z`. If `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, the program prints '-'. If `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, the program prints '+'. Otherwise, the program prints '?'.***
