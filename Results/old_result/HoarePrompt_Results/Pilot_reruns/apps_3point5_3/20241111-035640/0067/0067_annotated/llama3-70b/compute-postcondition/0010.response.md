The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the preconditions that `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The function does not return any specific output based on these parameters. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to perform some operation or task based on the preconditions provided without returning any specific value.
