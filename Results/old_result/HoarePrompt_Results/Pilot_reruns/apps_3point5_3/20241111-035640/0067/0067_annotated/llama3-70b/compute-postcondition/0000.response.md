Example Answer:
x, y, and z are assigned values from the input split by space and converted to integers. The input values are assumed to be valid non-negative integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
