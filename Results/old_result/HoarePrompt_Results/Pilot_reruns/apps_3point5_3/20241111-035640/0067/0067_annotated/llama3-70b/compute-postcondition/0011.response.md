Functionality: ** The function does not accept any parameters and reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z from the user input. Based on the values of x, y, and z, it prints certain characters ('+', '-', '0', or '?'). The printing logic is as follows: 
- If x is greater than the sum of y and z, it prints '+'
- If x is less than y, it prints '-'
- If x equals y and z is 0, it prints '0'
- If x equals y and z is not 0, it prints '?'
- If none of the above conditions are met, it prints '?' without any further conditions.**
