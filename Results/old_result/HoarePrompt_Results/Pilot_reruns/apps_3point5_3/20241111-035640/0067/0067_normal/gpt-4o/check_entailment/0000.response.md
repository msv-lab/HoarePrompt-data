Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` as input and calculates the minimum and maximum possible upvotes and downvotes based on the unknown votes. It then checks the relationships between the maximum upvotes and minimum downvotes, as well as the maximum downvotes and minimum upvotes to determine the result. The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases.

For example:
- If the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, it prints '-'.
- If the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, it prints '+'.
- Otherwise, it prints '?' to indicate uncertainty. 

The code covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and the output hints correctly summarize the code's functionality.
