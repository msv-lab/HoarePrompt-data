Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- If the number of upvotes is greater than the sum of downvotes and unknown votes, then the result is definitely "+".
- If the number of downvotes is greater than the number of upvotes, then the result is definitely "-".
- If the number of upvotes is equal to the number of downvotes and there are no unknown votes, then the result is definitely "0".
- If the number of upvotes is equal to the number of downvotes and there are unknown votes, then the result is uncertain, so it correctly prints "?".
