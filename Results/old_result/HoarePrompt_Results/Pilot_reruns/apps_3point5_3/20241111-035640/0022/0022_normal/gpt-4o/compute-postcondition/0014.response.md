Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It also calculates the length of the string `s` and assigns it to `n`, ensuring `n` is greater than or equal to 2. The function then iterates through the characters of `s` from the start and end towards the middle, checking for symmetry. If the characters at symmetric indices in `s` are equal, it returns True; otherwise, it returns False. If the length of `s` is less than 2, no comparison is made.**
