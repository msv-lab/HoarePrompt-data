Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters; `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. The string `s` is checked for palindrome and `is_spalindrome` is set accordingly. Finally, either 'TAK' or 'NIE' is printed based on the value of `is_spalindrome`.**
