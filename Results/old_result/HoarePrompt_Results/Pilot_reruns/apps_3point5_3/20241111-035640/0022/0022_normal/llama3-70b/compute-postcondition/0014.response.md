Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters; `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. This handles the case where the given string is not a palindrome according to the specified conditions.***
