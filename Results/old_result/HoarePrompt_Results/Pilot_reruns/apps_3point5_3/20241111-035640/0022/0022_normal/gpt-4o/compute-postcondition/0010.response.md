According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 because `i` is currently 2 and less than `n // 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3**
