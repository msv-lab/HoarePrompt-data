According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, `n` is at least 2, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented and the condition `s[i] != s[n - 1 - i]` needs to be evaluated for the new value of `i`. 
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2**
