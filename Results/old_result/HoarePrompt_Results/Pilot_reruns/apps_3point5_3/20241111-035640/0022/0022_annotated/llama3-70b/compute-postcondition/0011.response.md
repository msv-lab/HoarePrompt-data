According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is True. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 2**
