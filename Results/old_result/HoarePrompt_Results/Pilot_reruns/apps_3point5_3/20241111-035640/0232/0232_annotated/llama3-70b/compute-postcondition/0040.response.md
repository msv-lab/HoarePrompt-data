Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating if the condition is met, `color_counts` is a dictionary that may or may not be empty, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary with the key `color` initialized to 0 if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is less than `n`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 2. If `color` is not present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. If all values in sorted `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop breaks, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0.***
