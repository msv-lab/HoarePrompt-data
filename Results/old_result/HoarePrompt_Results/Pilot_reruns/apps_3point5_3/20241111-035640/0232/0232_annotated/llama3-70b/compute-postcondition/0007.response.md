Example Answer: 
The value of color_counts[color] is incremented by 1. The previous value of color_counts[color] is unknown, so the output state is: n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 1 color, counts is a list of m integers such that 1 <= sum of all elements in counts <= n; color_counts is a dictionary with one key-value pair where color is the key and 0 is the value if color is not already in color_counts.
Output State: **n and m are integers such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 1 color, counts is a list of m integers such that 1 <= sum of all elements in counts <= n; color_counts is a dictionary with one key-value pair where color is the key and 0 is the value if color is not already in color_counts.**
