Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean indicating if the condition is met, `color` is added to `window_counts` with a value of 1 if all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, `color_counts` is a non-empty dictionary, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the `color` key has a value of 1, `j` is equal to `i + 4`, `i` is less than `n`, `colors` is a list or iterable with at least `i + 4 + 1` elements, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i + 4]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0.***
