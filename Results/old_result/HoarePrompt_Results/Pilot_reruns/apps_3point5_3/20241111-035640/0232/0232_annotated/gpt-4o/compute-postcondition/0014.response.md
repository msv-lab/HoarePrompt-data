Output State: **If all the counts in `current_counts` match the desired counts in `desired_counts` for every color, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the loop will continue to decrement the count for colors and update the `left` index until the condition is met. The final state will have `current_counts` with some counts less than the desired counts, `left` at a value greater than 0, `right` at a value less than `n`, and the function will not return 'YES'.**
