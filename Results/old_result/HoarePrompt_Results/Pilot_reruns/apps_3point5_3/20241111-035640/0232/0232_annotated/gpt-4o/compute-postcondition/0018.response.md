Example Answer:
The count of the color at index `right` in the `colors` list is incremented by 1 in the `current_counts` dictionary. The values of `current_counts`, `left`, and `right` are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_counts` has updated counts after incrementing the count of the color at index `right`, `left` is at a value greater than 0, `right` is at a value less than `n`.
Output State: **`current_counts` has updated counts after incrementing the count of the color at index `right`, `left` is at a value greater than 0, `right` is at a value less than `n`**
