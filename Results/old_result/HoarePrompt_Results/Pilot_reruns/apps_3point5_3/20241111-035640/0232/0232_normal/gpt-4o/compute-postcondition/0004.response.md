Example Answer:
The value of `colors[right]` is used as a key to access the value in `current_counts` and increment it by 1. The states of `desired_counts`, `current_counts`, `left`, and `right` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m with their corresponding values in list k, current_counts is a defaultdict with all values set to 0 corresponding to keys from 1 to m, left is 0, right is 0.
Output State: **desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m with their corresponding values in list k, current_counts is a defaultdict with all values set to 0 corresponding to keys from 1 to m, left is 0, right is 0**
