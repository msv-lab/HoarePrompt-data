Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values of integers obtained by splitting the input. The values of `n` and `m` are positive integers representing the number of Jedi Knights and possible colors, respectively. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color**
