Output State: **`found` is a boolean flag. After the execution of the loop, if all the values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, `found` is set to True. The dictionary `window_counts` is updated with the counts of each color encountered. `n` is guaranteed to be greater than or equal to `i`, `j` is the current index within the loop, `i` is the starting index, and `color` is the color at the current index in the list `colors`. If `color` was not initially present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios, including cases where the loop may not execute due to `n` being less than or equal to `i`, resulting in no change to the variables.**
