Output State: **`found` is True, `n` is a positive integer, `j+1` and `i` maintain their initial conditions, `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in the `colors` list, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 2 if the color was present in `window_counts`, otherwise `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `n+1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
