Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable, `n` is a positive integer, `window_counts` is a dictionary with updated counts. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `color` is added to `window_counts` with a value of 0. `j` is the previous value of `j` plus 1, and `color` is assigned the value at index `j` from the list `colors`. This postcondition covers the case where `color` is not already in `window_counts` and ensures that it is added with a value of 0.***
