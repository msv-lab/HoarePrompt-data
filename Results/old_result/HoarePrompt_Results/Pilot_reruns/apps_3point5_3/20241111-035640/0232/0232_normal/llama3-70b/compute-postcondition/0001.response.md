Example Answer:
`colors` is assigned the list of integers obtained by mapping the input string to integers. The previous values of variables `n`, `m`, and `counts` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color**
