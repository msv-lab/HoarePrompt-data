Functionality: **The function `func` accepts inputs for the number of Jedi Knights, possible colors, colors of lightsabers for each Jedi Knight, and desired counts of lightsabers for each color. It then iterates through the colors and counts the occurrences of each color among the Jedi Knights. If the counts match the desired targets for any window of colors, it sets `found` to True. Finally, it prints 'YES' if a matching window is found, otherwise 'NO'. The function does not have a return value specified, and it handles cases where there are no colors provided or if the `found` variable is already True.**
