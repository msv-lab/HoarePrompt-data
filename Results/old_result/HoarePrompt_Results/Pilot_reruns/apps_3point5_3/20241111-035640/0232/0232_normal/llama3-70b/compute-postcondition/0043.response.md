Output State: **`found` is True, `n` is a positive integer, `window_counts` maintains its updated counts, `j` is less than `n+1`, `color` is assigned the value at index `j` from the list `colors`, and if `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is assigned 0, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
