Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It first determines the maximum number of lemons based on the ratios provided, then calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the maximum number of each type of fruit by their respective ratios. The program then prints the total fruits, which is the correct output according to the problem description. 

For every input and potential case, the program correctly follows the recipe of 1:2:4 ratio for lemons, apples, and pears respectively, ensuring that Nikolay can cook the compote using the maximum possible number of fruits. Therefore, the program is correct for all cases.
