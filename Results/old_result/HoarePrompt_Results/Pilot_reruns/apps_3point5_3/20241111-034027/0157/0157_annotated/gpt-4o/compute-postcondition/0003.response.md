Example Answer:
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value between `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. However, the variable `c` is not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
