Example Answer:
`c` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `c` will now be the input integer provided by the user. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the input integer provided by the user.
Output State: **1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is the input integer provided by the user**
