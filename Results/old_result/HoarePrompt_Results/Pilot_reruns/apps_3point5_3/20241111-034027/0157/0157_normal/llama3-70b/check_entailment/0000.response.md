Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes in three inputs representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has.
- Then it calculates the minimum value between the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and one-fourth the number of pears.
- Finally, it prints the result of the sum of this minimum value multiplied by 1, 2, and 4 respectively, which is exactly the required ratio of 1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears in the compote.
- The code correctly handles the scenario where Nikolay does not have enough fruits to cook any compote, resulting in an output of 0.
- The code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, hence the correctness is True.
