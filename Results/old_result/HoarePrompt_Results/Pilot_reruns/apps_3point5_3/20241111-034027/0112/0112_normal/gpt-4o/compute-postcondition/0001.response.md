Example Answer:
A list `used_cubes` is created with `n` elements, all initialized to `False`. The value of `n` is unknown in the initial state, so the output state is: `digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`**
