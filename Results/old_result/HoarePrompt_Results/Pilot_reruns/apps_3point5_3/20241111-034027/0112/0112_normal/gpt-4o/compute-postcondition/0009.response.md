According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the first element of `used_cubes` is set to True if it was not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces[0]`, `found` is True, and `i` is 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented. 
State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the first element of `used_cubes` is set to True if it was not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces[0]`, `found` is True, and `i` is 1**
