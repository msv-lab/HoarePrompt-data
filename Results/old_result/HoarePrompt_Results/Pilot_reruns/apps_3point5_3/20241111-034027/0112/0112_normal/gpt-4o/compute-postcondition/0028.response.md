Output State: 
- If `digits` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and the state of the variables will remain unchanged.
- If `n` is less than the number of elements in `digits`, the loop will not execute for all values of `i`, and the program exits without altering the variables.
- If `digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the elements of `used_cubes` are set to True sequentially if they were not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces`. 
- `found` is True if at least one digit is found and False otherwise.
- `i` is the index of the next cube face to check if the loop didn't exit early.
- `n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `digits`.

**Summary: the loop iterates over each digit in `digits` and checks if it can be found in any of the cube faces. If a digit is found in a cube face that hasn't been used before, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True. If a digit cannot be found, the loop returns False. The loop continues until all digits are checked or one is not found in any cube face.**
