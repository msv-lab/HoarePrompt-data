Example Answer: 
The set `digits` is updated with the strings of individual digits from each number in the sublists of `cubes`. Since `cubes` contains at least 3 sublists, the set `digits` will now contain all the unique digits present in those sublists. The values of `n` and `cubes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of sublists of integers with at least 3 sublists, `digits` is a set containing all unique digits from the numbers in the list `cubes` as strings.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of sublists of integers with at least 3 sublists, `digits` is a set containing all unique digits from the numbers in the list `cubes` as strings**
