Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `can_form_number` checks if a number can be formed using the cube faces provided, but it does not take into account the restriction that Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. This means that the code does not handle this specific edge case and can potentially provide incorrect results for numbers that involve the digits 6 and 9.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all the constraints mentioned in the problem description.
