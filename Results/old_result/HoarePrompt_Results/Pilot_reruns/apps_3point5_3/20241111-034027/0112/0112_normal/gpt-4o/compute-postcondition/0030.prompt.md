You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **
```
def can_form_number(num):
```
Output: Case_1: Output State: 
- If `digits` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and the state of the variables will remain unchanged.
- If `n` is less than the number of elements in `digits`, the loop will not execute for all values of `i`, and the program exits without altering the variables.
- If `digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the elements of `used_cubes` are set to True sequentially if they were not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces`. 
- `found` is True if at least one digit is found and False otherwise.
- `i` is the index of the next cube face to check if the loop didn't exit early.
- `n` is greater than or equal to the number of elements in `digits`.

**Summary: the loop iterates over each digit in `digits` and checks if it can be found in any of the cube faces. If a digit is found in a cube face that hasn't been used before, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True. If a digit cannot be found, the loop returns False. The loop continues until all digits are checked or one is not found in any cube face.**

Case_2: The loop iterates over each digit in `digits` and checks if it can be found in any of the cube faces. If a digit is found in a cube face that hasn't been used before, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True. If a digit cannot be found, the loop returns False. The loop continues until all digits are checked or one is not found in any cube face.

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
