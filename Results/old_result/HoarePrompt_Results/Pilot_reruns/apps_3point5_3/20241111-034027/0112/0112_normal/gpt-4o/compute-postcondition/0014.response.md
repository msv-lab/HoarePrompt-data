According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the first element of `used_cubes` is set to True if it was not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces[0]`, `found` is True, and `i` is 1. If the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is not satisfied, then the loop exits. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` needs to be increased by 1 as the loop will iterate to the next value.
- If the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is not met, then `found` should be set to False to continue the loop execution if required.

State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, the first element of `used_cubes` is set to True if it was not previously True and the corresponding digit from `digits` is in `cube_faces[0]`, `found` is False, and `i` is 2**
