According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 0. Before the loop starts, the `digits` list must have at least 1 character from `num`, `used_cubes` list must have `n` elements initialized to `False`, and `found` must be `False`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `i` should be 0.
State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from `num` with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to `False`, `found` is False, `i` is 0**
