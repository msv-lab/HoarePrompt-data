Output State: **If at least one cube face contains each digit in the list `digits`, then all elements in `used_cubes` will be set to True after the loop executes. If any digit is missing in the cube_faces, the loop will return False before completion. If `digits` has more elements than the total number of unique digits across all cubes, the loop will not execute.**
