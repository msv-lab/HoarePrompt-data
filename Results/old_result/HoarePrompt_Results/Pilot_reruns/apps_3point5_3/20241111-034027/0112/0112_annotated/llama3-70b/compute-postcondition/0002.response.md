Example Answer:
The set `digits` is initialized as an empty set. The variables `n` and `cubes` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers converted from input, `digits` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers converted from input, `digits` is an empty set**
