Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers, `digits` is a list containing at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the first element is `True` after the first iteration, `found` is `True`, `i` is incremented by 1. If `used_cubes[i]` is `False` and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, `found` is set to `True`, and the loop breaks.***
