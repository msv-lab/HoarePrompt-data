Example Answer:
Each number `num` is converted to a string and then split into individual characters, forming a list of digits. The variable `digits` will contain all the digits of the number `num`. Since the previous values of `digits` and `num` are not provided, the output state is: n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, and `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of the number `num`.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, and `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of the number `num`**
