Correctness: **True**.

Explanation: The program reads a string input and a target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. It then iterates through the input string and the target string, checking if the characters match. If the input string contains the target string as a subsequence, it prints the target string. Otherwise, it prints -1. The program correctly checks if the input string can be transformed to contain the English alphabet as a subsequence. It covers all potential cases and provides the correct output.
