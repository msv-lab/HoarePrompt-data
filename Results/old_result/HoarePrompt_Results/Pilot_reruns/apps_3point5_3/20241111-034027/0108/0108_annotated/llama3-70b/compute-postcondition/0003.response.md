According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `alphabet`. Since `alphabet` consists of all small English letters, the loop will execute 26 times. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters does not ensure the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is a string consisting of at least 26 small English letters, `res` is an empty string, and `char` is the first character in the `alphabet`.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of at least 26 small English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is 'a'**
