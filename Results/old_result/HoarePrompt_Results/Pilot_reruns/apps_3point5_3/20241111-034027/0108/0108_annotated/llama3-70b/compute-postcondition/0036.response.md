According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the presence of 'a' in 's'. If 'a' is present in 's', the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, 'a' is present in 's', `s` contains the next character after 'e' in the ASCII sequence, `alphabet` still has more characters left, `res` includes characters beyond the current character in `s`, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` that has not been encountered in `s` yet. To execute the loop one more time, `char` should be the next character in `alphabet` that has not been encountered in `s` yet, which means it should be the character after the current `char`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If 'a' is present in 's', then `s` contains the next character after 'e' in the ASCII sequence, `alphabet` still has more characters left, `res` includes characters beyond the current character in `s`, `char` is the next character in `alphabet` that has not been encountered in `s` yet, and `char` is the character after the current `char`.**
