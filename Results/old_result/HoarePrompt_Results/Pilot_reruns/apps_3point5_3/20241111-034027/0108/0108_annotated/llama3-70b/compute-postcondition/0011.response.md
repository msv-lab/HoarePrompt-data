Example Answer:
The character 'b' or 'c' in `s` is replaced with the character that comes after 'b' in the alphabet. Since `char` is 'b', the 'b' in `s` is replaced with 'c'. The `replace` function replaces the first occurrence of 'b' in `s` with 'c'. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` contains the character 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'.
Output State: **`s` contains the character 'c', `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'**
