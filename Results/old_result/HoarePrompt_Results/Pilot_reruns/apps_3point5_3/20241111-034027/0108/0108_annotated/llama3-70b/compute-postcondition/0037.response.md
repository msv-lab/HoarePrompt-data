Output State: 
If 'a' is present in 's', then after the loop finishes, `s` will contain the first occurrence of a character that comes after 'f' in the ASCII sequence, `alphabet` will remain 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` will be 'bcdef...xyz', `char` will be a character present in 's' but not yet encountered where 'char' has been replaced by the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence in string `s`. If 'a' is not present in 's' initially, the loop will not execute and `s`, `alphabet`, `res`, and `char` will remain the same as the initial state. The loop will continue until 'z' is reached or until 'char' is not present in 's' anymore.
