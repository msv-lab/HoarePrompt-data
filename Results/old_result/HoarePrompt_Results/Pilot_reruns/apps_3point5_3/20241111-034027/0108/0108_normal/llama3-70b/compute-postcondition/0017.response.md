According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is 'a'. Since 'a' is always in the range from 'a' to 'z', `char` does not need to be adjusted. `s` is modified based on the previous iteration, so it needs to be adjusted to ensure that `char` is still in `s` for the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is modified based on the previous iteration, `res` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z', `char` is 'a'**
