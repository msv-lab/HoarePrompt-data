According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of the `target` string. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, `j` is 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the following states need to be adjusted: `i` needs to be incremented by 1 since it is used to access the next character in string `s`, and `j` needs to be incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 2, `j` is 2**
