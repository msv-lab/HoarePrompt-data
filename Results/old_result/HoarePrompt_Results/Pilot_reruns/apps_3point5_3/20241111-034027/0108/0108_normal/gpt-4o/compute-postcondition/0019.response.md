Postcondition: ***`s` is a string. If `s` contains the entire alphabet in order, then `i` is the length of `s`, `j` is 26, and the function prints the value of `target`. If `s` does not contain the entire alphabet or if `s` is longer than the alphabet, then `i` is the length of `s`, `j` is less than 26 or equal to 26, and the function prints -1. If `s` is shorter than the alphabet, then `i` is the length of `s`, `j` is less than 26, and the function prints -1. If `s` is empty, then `i` is 0, `j` is 0, and the function prints -1.***
