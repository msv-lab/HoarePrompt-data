Output State: 
If the input string `s` contains all characters in the alphabet at least once, then after the loop executes, `s` will be an empty string, `res` will contain all characters from 'a' to 'z' in order, and `char` will be the next character after 'z' in the alphabet. If the input string does not contain all characters in the alphabet, the loop will terminate early when `char` is not found in `s`, and `s` will be modified accordingly with only some characters replaced.
If `s` is an empty string or does not contain any characters from the alphabet, the loop will not execute at all, and `res` will remain an empty string.
