Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of the character 'a' in `s` with the next character in the ASCII sequence, which is 'b'. The variable `char` is 'a', so 'a' is replaced with 'b' in `s`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is modified with 'a' replaced by 'b', `res` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'a', `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is modified with 'a' replaced by 'b', `res` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z' followed by 'a', `char` is 'a'**
