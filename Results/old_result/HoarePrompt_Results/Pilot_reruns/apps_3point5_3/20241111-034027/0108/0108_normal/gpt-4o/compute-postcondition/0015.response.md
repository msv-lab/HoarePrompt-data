According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if both `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, and if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1. To execute the loop one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be less than the length of string `s`
- `j` should be less than the length of the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is increased by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`**
