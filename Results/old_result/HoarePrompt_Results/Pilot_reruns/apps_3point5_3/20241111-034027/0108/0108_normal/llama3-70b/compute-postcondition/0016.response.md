Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of 'a' in string `s` with the character that comes after 'a' in the alphabet. The value of `char` is 'a', so 'a' is replaced with 'b'. The modified `s` is then stored back in `s`. The `res` and `char` variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is modified based on the previous iteration, `res` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z', `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is modified based on the previous iteration, `res` contains all characters from 'a' to 'z', `char` is 'a'**
