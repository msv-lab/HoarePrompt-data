Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from input and then determines whether to print 'YES' or 'NO' based on the following conditions:
1. If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES'.
2. If `c` is equal to 0, it prints 'NO'.
3. If `(b - a) % c` is equal to 0 and `(b - a) / c` is greater than or equal to 0, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
