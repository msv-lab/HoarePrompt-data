Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values. If `c` is 0, then if `a` is equal to `b`, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. If `c` is not 0, and if (b - a) % c is equal to 0 and (b - a) / c is greater than or equal to 0, then 'YES' is printed. In all other cases, 'NO' is printed.***
