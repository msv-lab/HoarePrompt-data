The function `func` reads three integer values from the input and then based on those values, it either prints 'YES' or 'NO'. If the third value `c` is 0, it checks if the first two values `a` and `b` are equal and prints 'YES' if they are, 'NO' otherwise. If `c` is not 0, it validates if the difference between `a` and `b` is divisible by `c` and the result is greater than or equal to 0, then it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not explicitly return any value.
