Example Answer:
The variables a, b, and c are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers using map and split. The input is expected to provide three integers separated by spaces. Therefore, the output state is: a, b, and c are assigned integer values from the input.
Output State: **a, b, and c are assigned integer values from the input**
