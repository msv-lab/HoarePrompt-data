Example Answer: 
The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input after splitting by space. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` can be any integers within the specified range. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9**
