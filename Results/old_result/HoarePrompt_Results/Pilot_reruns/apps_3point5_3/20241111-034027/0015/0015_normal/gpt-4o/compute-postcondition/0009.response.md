Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user input and checks the following conditions:
- If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES'.
- If `c` is 0, it prints 'NO'.
- If `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, it prints 'YES'.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'NO'.
The integers `a`, `b`, and `c` are within the range -10^9 to 10^9.**
