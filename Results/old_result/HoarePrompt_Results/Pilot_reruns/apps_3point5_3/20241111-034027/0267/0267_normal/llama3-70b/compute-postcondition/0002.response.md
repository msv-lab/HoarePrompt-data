Example Answer: 
The function returns the value stored in the dictionary `dp` at key `(n, k)`. The initial states are `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values. Since there is no information provided on the values stored in `dp`, the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and the function returns the value stored in `dp` at key `(n, k)`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and the function returns the value stored in `dp` at key `(n, k)`**
