Example Answer: 
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The value of `num` is unknown as it is passed as a parameter to `func_1(num + 1, k)`. The values of `l` and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is updated based on the result of `func_1(num + 1, k)`, `l` remains the same, `r` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated based on the result of `func_1(num + 1, k)`, `l` remains the same, `r` is increased by 1**
