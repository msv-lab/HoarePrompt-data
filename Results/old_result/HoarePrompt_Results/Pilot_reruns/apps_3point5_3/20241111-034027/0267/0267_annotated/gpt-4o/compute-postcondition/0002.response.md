Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulus `MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `num` is equal to `l`. After executing the code, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(0 + l) % MOD`. 
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated to the new calculated value, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`**
