Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1)). The value of `i` is 3, so the calculation involves powers of 10. The previous values of `n` and `k` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= n < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10, dp[n, k] has been updated with a new value, i is 3.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= n < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10, dp[n, k] has been updated with a new value, i is 3**
