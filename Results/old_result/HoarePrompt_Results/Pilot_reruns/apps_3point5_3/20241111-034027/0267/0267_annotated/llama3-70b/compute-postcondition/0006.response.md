According to the code, the loop will execute if k is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, k is a positive integer, so it already satisfies the condition. Additionally, i ranges from 1 to k-1, so i should be set to 1 and dp[n, k] should be updated to 9.
State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= n < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10, dp[n, k] is 9, i is 1**
