According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10, dp[n, k] has been updated with a new value, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **n is a positive integer, k is a positive integer such that 1 <= n < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10, dp[n, k] has been updated with a new value, i is 3**
