Output State: **If k is equal to 0, the loop does not execute and dp[n, k] remains 9. If k is greater than 0, dp[n, k] is updated with a new value after the loop executes. The final value of dp[n, k] is calculated based on the given formula in the loop code. i is equal to k after the loop executes.**
