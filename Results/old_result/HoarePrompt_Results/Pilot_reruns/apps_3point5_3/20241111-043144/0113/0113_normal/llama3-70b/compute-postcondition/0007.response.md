According to the code, the loop will execute again if the condition `n % x != 0` is true. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 4 and 10^9 where n % x != 0, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, and `x` is a value between 1 and 100,000,000. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` needs to be adjusted so that `n % x` is still not equal to 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 4 and 10^9 where n % x != 0, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, `x` is a value between 1 and 100,000,000**
