Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` can be any value between 0 and 8. Therefore, the value of `x` will be `10 ** 0` to `10 ** 8`, which results in `x` being 1 to 100,000,000. The states of other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8, `x` is a value between 1 and 100,000,000**
