Output State: **If n is not divisible by x for any positive integer value of x, n will keep incrementing by 1, k will remain the same, and x will be recalculated based on the new value of k after each iteration. The loop will continue until n is divisible by x. If n is already divisible by x, the loop will not execute and the values of n, k, and x will remain the same as the initial state.**
