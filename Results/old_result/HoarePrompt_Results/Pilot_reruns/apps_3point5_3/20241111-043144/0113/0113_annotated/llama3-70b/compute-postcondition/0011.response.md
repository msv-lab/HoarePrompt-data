Functionality: **The function `func` reads two positive integers `n` and `k` from input and calculates a value `x` based on `k`. It then increments `n` until it is divisible by `x` and prints the final value of `n`. The function does not explicitly return a value, and the specific mathematical operation involved is not provided. The code may lead to an infinite loop if `n` is already divisible by `x` or if the condition in the while loop is not properly met.**
