Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`. It calculates the appropriate multiplier based on the value of `k`, where `multiplier` can be one of `1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, 100000000`. The function then returns the product of `n` and the calculated multiplier as `x`. It's important to note that the function relies on the `math` module for the `gcd` function, but the import statement for `math` is missing from the code provided. Therefore, to ensure the correct functionality of the function, the `import math` statement needs to be added at the beginning of the code.
