Example Answer: 
The variable `tens` is assigned a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers. The values in the list are 'ten', 'twenty', 'thirty', 'forty', 'fifty', 'sixty', 'seventy', 'eighty', 'ninety'. The integer variable `s` is between 0 and 99 and is not changed by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99**
