Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the word representing the number from eleven to nineteen. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is divisible by 10, the function returns the word representing the tens place of `n`. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not divisible by 10, the function returns the word representing `n` in words by combining the word representing the tens place of `n`, a hyphen, and the word representing the ones place of `n`.***
