Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input integer `n` and the list `a` containing `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.
- It then calculates the maximum distance between the minimum and maximum values by finding the absolute difference between the indices of 1 and `n` minus 1, taking into account the edge case of the minimum and maximum elements being at the ends of the list.
- The code prints the maximum possible distance after the swap.

The code follows the problem description for every potential case and the output hints confirm that the code correctly implements the logic described.
