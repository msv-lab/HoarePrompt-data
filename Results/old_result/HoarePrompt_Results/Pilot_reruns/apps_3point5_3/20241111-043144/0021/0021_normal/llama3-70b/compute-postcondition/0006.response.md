Output State: **`n` is an input integer within the range 2 to 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n` in increasing order, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is `n-1`, `max_dist` is `n-2`, `min_dist` is `n-2`. After execution, the program prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`.**
