Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and the maximum elements by performing exactly one swap. It first finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array. Then it calculates the maximum and minimum distances that can be achieved by swapping those elements. Finally, it prints the maximum of these distances. The logic of the program is sound and it covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
