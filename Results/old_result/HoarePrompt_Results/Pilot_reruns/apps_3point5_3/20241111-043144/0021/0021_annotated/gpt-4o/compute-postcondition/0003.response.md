Example Answer:
`max_pos` is assigned the index of the element `n` in list `a`. Given that `n` is between 2 and 100, and `a` has `n` distinct integers between 1 and `n`, the index of `n` in list `a` will always be valid. Therefore, `max_pos` will be the index of `n` in list `a`. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, inclusive, `min_pos` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of element n in list `a`**
