The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of n distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the elements 0 and 1, (n-1) and 1, 0 and n, (n-1) and n in the list `a`, and prints the maximum of these distances. The function assumes `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100 and `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, inclusive. The function does not return any value, only prints the maximum distance.
