Example Answer:
The `print` function outputs the value of `max_distance` which is the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`. The initial values of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4` are calculated based on the initial state of variables `a`, `min_pos`, and `max_pos`. The maximum distance is the maximum absolute difference between 0, n-1, min_pos, and (n-1) with respect to the indexes in list `a`. After calculating the maximum distance, it is printed.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of element n in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of element n in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between (n - 1) and the index of element n in list `a`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos, `dist4` is the absolute difference between (n - 1) and min_pos, `max_distance` is the maximum value among dist1, dist2, dist3, and dist4.**
