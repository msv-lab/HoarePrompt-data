Example Answer:
The variable `min_time` is assigned the value of positive infinity. The loop does not execute if `n` is 0, so `buses` remains an empty list. Therefore, the Output State is: After the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer between 0 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuples `(s, d)` added in each iteration of the loop. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list.
Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer between 0 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuples `(s, d)` added in each iteration of the loop. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list.**
