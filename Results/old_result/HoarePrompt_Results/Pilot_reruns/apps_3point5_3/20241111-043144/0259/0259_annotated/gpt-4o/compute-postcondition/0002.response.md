According to the code, the loop can execute as long as n is at least 1. Before the loop starts, n is already a positive integer, so it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. The other variables t, bus_routes, min_wait_time, and chosen_route do not directly affect the loop execution. Therefore, the state before the loop starts remains the same.
State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1**
