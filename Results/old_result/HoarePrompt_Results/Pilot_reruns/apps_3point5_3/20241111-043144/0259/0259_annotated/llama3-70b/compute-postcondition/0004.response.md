Example Answer: 
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are already assigned from the input split into integers. Therefore, after execution, the `buses` list will contain a tuple `(s, d)`. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`**
