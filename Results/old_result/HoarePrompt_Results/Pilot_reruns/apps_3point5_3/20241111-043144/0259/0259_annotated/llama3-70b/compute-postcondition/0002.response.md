According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Since `n` is already a positive integer between 1 and 100, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `t` and `buses` do not have any influence on the loop execution, so they can remain unchanged.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is an empty list**
