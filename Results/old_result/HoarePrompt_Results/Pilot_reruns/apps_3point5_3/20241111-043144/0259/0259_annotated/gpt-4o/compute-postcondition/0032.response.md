According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the postcondition ensures that `i` is incremented by 1 and `n` is greater than the new value of `i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be greater than the new value of `i+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than the new value of `i+1`, `t` and `min_wait_time` remain the same, `bus_routes`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `wait_time`, `chosen_route` are updated based on the new values of `s_i` and `d_i`, `i` is incremented by 1**
