Postcondition: ***n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, s_i is the source value from the tuple at index i, d_i is the destination value from the tuple at index i. If s_i >= t, wait_time is the difference between s_i and t. If (t - s_i) % d_i equals 0, wait_time is 0. Otherwise, wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring that the program variables are correctly updated based on the conditions of the if else block.***
