The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes. 
- `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station. 
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of this route arrives and the interval between two buses of this route respectively. 

The function iterates through each bus route in `bus_routes` and calculates the `wait_time` based on the conditions provided. It then updates `min_wait_time` to the minimum value of `wait_time` and the current `min_wait_time`. The variable `chosen_route` is updated to the index of the bus route with the minimum `wait_time` plus 1. 

At the end of the loop, `min_wait_time` will contain the minimum wait time among all bus routes, and `chosen_route` will be the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. The function returns `chosen_route`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. It calculates the minimum wait time among all bus routes based on the conditions provided and returns the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time.**
