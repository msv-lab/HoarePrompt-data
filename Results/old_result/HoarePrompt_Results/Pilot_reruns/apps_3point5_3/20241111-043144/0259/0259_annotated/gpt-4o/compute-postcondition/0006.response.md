Example Answer:
The code calculates the wait time for a specific bus route based on the source (`s_i`), destination (`d_i`), current time (`t`), and previous wait time. The initial values of `n`, `t`, bus_routes, min_wait_time, and chosen_route remain unchanged. After execution, the wait time for the specific bus route is calculated. 
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, and the wait time for the specific bus route is calculated**
