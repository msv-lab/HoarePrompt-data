According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times based on the range provided. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. To execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to be within the range of 1 to 99. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 99, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`**
