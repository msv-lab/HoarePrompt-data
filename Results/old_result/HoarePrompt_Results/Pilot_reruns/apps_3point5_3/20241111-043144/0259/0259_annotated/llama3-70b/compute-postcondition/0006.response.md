Example Answer:
The values of `s` and `d` are assigned by splitting the input string into integers. If the input is in the format "x y", then `s` will be assigned the value of `x` and `d` will be assigned the value of `y`. The values of `n` and `t` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 99, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 99, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`**
