Example Answer:
The values of s_i and d_i are assigned the values of the (i+1)th tuple in bus_routes. The values of s_i and d_i will depend on the tuple at index i in the bus_routes list. The variables min_wait_time and chosen_route will be updated based on the new values of s_i and d_i, which are not provided in the initial state. Variable i is then incremented by 1. The condition n > i is not explicitly stated in the initial state but is assumed to be true. Therefore, the Output State is: n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time and chosen_route are updated based on the new values of s_i and d_i, i is incremented by 1, and n is greater than the new value of i.
Output State: **n and t are positive integers, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time and chosen_route are updated based on the new values of s_i and d_i, i is incremented by 1, and n is greater than the new value of i**
