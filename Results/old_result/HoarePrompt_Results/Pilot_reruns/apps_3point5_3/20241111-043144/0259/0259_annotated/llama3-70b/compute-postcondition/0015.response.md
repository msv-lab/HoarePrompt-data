According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list has at least 1 tuple, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 0 and 100, and `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5. So for the loop to be executed, the `buses` list must have at least 1 tuple, and the `i` is 0, `s` and `d` values correspond to the first tuple in the list. 
State: **After the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer between 0 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains at least 1 tuple, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` correspond to the first tuple in the list, `ans` is assigned -1**
