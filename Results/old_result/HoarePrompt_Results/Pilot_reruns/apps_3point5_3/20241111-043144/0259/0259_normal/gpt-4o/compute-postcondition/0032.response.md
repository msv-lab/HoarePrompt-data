According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. `i` should be updated to `i + 1`.
State: **`min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1`, `s_i`, `d_i` are positive integers where `i + 1` is less than `n`**
