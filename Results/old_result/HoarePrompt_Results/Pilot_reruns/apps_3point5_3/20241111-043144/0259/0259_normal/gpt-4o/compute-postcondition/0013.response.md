Example Answer:
The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from the tuple `bus_routes[i]`. The values of `i`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1**
