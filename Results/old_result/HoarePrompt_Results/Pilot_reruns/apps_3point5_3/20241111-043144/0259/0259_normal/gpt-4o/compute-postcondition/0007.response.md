Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
