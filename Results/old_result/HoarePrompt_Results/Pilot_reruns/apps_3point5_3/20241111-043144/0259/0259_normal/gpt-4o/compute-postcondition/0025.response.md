Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of 0. This initialization does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is less than `n`, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`, and `wait_time` is 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is less than `n`, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`, and `wait_time` is 0**
