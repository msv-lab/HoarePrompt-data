Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, where `t` is not given in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is less than `n`, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is less than `n`, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`**
