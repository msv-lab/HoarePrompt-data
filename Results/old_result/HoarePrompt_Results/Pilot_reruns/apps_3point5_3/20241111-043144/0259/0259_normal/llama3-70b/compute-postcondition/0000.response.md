Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The input is split into two integers, so `n` and `t` are assigned those values. The values of `n` and `t` are constrained such that 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^5. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 10^5**
