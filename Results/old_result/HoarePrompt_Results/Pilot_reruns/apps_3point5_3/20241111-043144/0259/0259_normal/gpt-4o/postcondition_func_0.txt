The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. It iterates over the bus routes to calculate the minimum wait time for Serval and determines the chosen route based on Serval's arrival time. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function will not execute the loop, and `min_wait_time` will remain positive infinity, and `chosen_route` will remain -1. The function then returns the chosen route with the minimum wait time.
