Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`, where `s_i` is the value of `i` incremented by 1, and `t` is some value. The value of `i` is incremented by 1, so the new value of `i` is one more than the previous value. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_(i+1) - t`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer, `chosen_route` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_(i+1) - t`**
