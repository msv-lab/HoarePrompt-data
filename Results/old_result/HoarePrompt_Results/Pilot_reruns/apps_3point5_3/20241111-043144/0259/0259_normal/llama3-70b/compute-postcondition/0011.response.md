According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as _ is less than n. At the end of the last iteration, n is between 1 and 100. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, _ needs to be adjusted to be less than n+1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is between 1 and 100, t is an integer between 1 and 10^5, buses contains tuples (s, d) where _ is less than n+1, s and d are assigned values based on the input split into integers**
