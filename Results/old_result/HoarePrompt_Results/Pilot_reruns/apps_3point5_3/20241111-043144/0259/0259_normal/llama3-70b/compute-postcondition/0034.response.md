Functionality: The function `func` reads input pairs of integers (s, d) and appends them to a list `buses`. It then calculates the minimum time based on these input tuples and prints the index of the tuple that resulted in the minimum time. If the list `buses` is empty, the function does not execute the loop, and the minimum time remains infinity while the index `ans` stays at -1.
