Postcondition: ***`gcd` is a perfect square, `N` is an integer with N >= 2, and `max_divisor` is the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`. If the square of `i` is not equal to `gcd`, then the `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the initial `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`.***
