Example Answer: 
The `divisors` set is updated by adding the value of `x` divided by `i`. The set `divisors` now contains this new value. The previous values of other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **N is an integer where 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer where 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, x is a positive integer, divisors contains the updated values of i**
