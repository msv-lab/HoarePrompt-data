Postcondition: ***N is an integer where 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer where 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, x is a positive integer. If x is divisible by i, the set `divisors` contains both i and x // i. This holds true for all possible values of x and i, considering edge cases where x % i == 0.***
