According to the code, the loop can execute again if the value of `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, N is an integer where 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer where 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, and x is a positive integer. The loop will execute one more time if the value of `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x` and greater than the value of `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is the value of `i`.
State: **N is an integer where 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer where 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, x is a positive integer, i is equal to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`.**
