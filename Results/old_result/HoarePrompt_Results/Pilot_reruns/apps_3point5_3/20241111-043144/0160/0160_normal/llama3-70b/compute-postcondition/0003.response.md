According to the code, the loop will always execute as the range starts from 1 and goes up to N-1. Therefore, the loop will execute for N > 1.

To adjust the state before the loop starts:
State: **N is an integer such that N > 1, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers, gcd is assigned the value of the first element in list A**
