The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`, where x is a tuple containing N, K, and a list of integers A_i for 1 <= i <= N. N is an integer where 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer where 0 <= K <= 10^9, and A_i are integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6. The function does not return any value explicitly. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple x containing N, K, and a list of integers A_i. N must be between 2 and 500, K must be between 0 and 10^9, and each A_i must be between 1 and 10^6.**
