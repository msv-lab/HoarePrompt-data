Example Answer:
The function returns the sorted list of divisors in reverse order. The set `divisors` contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1 and x itself. If x is not divisible by any number up to int(math.sqrt(x)), then the set `divisors` remains empty. Since the initial state does not provide the value of x, the output state will be `N` is an integer where 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is an integer where 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A_i` are integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N.
Output State: **N is an integer where 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer where 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N**
