Example Answer:
Each element of `divisors` is updated by adding `x` divided by `i`. Since `divisors` initially contains only 2, after executing the code, `divisors` will contain 2 plus the result of `x` divided by `i` for each element in `divisors`. The values of `N`, `K`, and `A_i` are not affected. 
Output State: **N is an integer where 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer where 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, x is a positive integer, `divisors` contains updated values**
