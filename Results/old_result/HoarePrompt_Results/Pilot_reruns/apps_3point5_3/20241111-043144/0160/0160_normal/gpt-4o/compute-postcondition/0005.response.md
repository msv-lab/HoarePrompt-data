According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer where 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is an integer where 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A_i` are integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **N is an integer where 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer where 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers where 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, x is a positive integer, i is 2**
