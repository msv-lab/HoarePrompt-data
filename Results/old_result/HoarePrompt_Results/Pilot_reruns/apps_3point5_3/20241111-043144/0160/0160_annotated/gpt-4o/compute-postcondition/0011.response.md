Example Answer:
`i` is updated to the next value after the current square root of `x`, and `divisors` has `i` added to it. The value of `i` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, `divisors` contains integers from 1 to N, x is greater than or equal to 1, and `divisors` has `i` added to it.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N, `divisors` contains integers from 1 to N, x is greater than or equal to 1, and `divisors` has `i` added to it**
