The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is a list of integers where N is the length of the list and the integers are within the constraints specified. The function calculates the divisors of each integer in the list, sorts them in reverse order, and returns the sorted list of divisors. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept a list of integers `x`, calculate the divisors of each integer, and return the sorted list of divisors in reverse order.
