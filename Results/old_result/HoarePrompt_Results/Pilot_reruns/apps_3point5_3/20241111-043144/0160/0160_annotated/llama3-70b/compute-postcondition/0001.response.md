Example Answer:
The list `A` is assigned the values obtained by mapping each input element to an integer. Since the input is split, the number of elements in `A` depends on the input provided. The values in `A` are integers. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9; A is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9; A is a list of integers obtained from input**
