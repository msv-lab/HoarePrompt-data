According to the code, the loop will execute N-1 times based on the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, N is an integer between 2 and 500. To execute the loop one more time, N should be adjusted to N+1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **N is an integer between 3 and 501, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9; A is a list of integers obtained from input; gcd is the result of the gcd operation between the previous value of gcd and the 4th element of list A**
