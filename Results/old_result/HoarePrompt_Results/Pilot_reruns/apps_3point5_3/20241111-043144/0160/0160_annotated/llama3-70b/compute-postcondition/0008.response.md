Example Answer:
gcd is assigned the value of the result of gcd operation between the previous value of gcd and A[i], where i is 3. The previous value of gcd is unknown, and A[i] is the 4th element of the list A obtained from input. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9; A is a list of integers obtained from input; gcd is the result of the gcd operation between the previous value of gcd and the 4th element of list A.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 500, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9; A is a list of integers obtained from input; gcd is the result of the gcd operation between the previous value of gcd and the 4th element of list A**
