Example Answer: 
`r_index` is added to `n` and the result is appended to `r_queue`. The values of `r_index` and `n` are not specified in the initial state, so the output state is: `d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` has been modified based on the condition, `votes` remain unchanged, `d_index` has been updated to the popped element, `r_index` contains the value popped from `r_queue`.
Output State: **`d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` has been modified based on the condition, `votes` remain unchanged, `d_index` has been updated to the popped element, `r_index` contains the value popped from `r_queue`**
