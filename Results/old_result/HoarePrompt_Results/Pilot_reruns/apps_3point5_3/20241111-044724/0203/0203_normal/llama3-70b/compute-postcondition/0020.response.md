Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, fractions is the input string representing the fraction of each employee with at least 1 element. If depublicans is greater than remocrats, the program prints 'D'. Otherwise, it prints 'R'. If fractions contain 'D' fractions, depublicans is incremented by the total count of 'D' fractions encountered, and remocrats remains 0. If fractions contain non-'D' fractions, remocrats is incremented by the total count of non-'D' fractions encountered, and depublicans remains 0. If the input string is empty, the loop does not execute, and both depublicans and remocrats remain 0.***
