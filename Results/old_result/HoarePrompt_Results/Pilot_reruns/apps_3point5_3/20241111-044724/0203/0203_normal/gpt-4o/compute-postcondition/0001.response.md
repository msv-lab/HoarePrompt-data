Example Answer: 
The variable `votes` is assigned the input after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The length of the input string `votes` is `n`, and each character represents the vote of an employee ('D' for Democrat or 'R' for Republican). Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, votes is a string of length n containing characters 'D' or 'R' representing the fraction of each employee.
Output State: **Precondition: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200000, votes is a string of length n containing characters 'D' or 'R' representing the fraction of each employee**
