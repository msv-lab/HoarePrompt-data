Example Answer:
The code pops the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. The state of `r_queue` is changed by removing the first element. The state of `d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` has been modified, and `votes` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`d_queue` may have elements remaining, `r_queue` has been modified, `votes` remain unchanged**
