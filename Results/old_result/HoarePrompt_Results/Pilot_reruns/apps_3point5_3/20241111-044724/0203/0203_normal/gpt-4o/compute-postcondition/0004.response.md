According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `votes` list. If the `votes` list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `d_queue` and `r_queue` being empty lists does not ensure the loop will execute, so the states need to be adjusted to `votes` list has at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `v` is the first element in the `votes` list.

State: **`d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` is an empty list, `votes` list has at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `v` is the first element in the `votes` list**
