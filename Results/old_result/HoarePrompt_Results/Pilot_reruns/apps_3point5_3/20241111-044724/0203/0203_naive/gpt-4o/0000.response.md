Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly simulates the voting process described in the problem statement. It keeps track of the indices of employees belonging to the 'D' and 'R' fractions in separate queues. It then iterates through the queues, denying the right to vote to the corresponding employee based on their index. The program correctly handles the case where an employee's index exceeds the total number of employees by adding 'n' to their index. Finally, it determines the outcome of the vote based on which queue still has elements left. The program covers all possible scenarios and correctly predicts the outcome of the vote.
