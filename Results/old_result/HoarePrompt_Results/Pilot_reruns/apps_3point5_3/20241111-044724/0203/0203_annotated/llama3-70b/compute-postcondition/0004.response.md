According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` list. If the list has at least 1 fraction, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `depublicans` is 0 and `remocrats` is 0. So for the loop to be executed, the list `fractions` must have at least 1 fraction, and `fraction` is the first fraction in the list.
State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, `fraction` is the first fraction in the list, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
