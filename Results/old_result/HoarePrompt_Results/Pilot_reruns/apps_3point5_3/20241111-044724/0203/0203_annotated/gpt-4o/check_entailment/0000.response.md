Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The code does not handle the scenario where an employee denies voting rights to multiple other employees in a single round of voting. According to the problem description, an employee can deny the right to vote to one other employee only, but the code does not enforce this rule. This omission can lead to incorrect outcomes in certain scenarios, making the code incorrect.
