Example Answer:
`depublicans` is increased by 1, but the previous value of `depublicans` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, `fraction` is the next fraction in the list, and `depublicans` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of employees, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 1 fraction, `fraction` is the next fraction in the list, `depublicans` is increased by 1**
