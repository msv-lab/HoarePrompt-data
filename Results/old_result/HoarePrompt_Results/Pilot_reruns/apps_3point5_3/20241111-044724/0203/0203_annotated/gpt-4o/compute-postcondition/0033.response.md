Example Answer:
`r_queue` appends the value of `r_index + n` to itself. The value of `r_index` is updated with the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. The length of the string `votes` is `n`, and `n` is between 1 and 200,000. Therefore, after execution, the new value added to `r_queue` is `r_index + n`, and `r_index` is updated accordingly. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` and `r_queue` both have at least one element, `d_index` is updated with a new value from the front of `d_queue`, `r_index` is updated with the value popped from the front of `r_queue`, `r_queue` contains the value `r_index + n`**
