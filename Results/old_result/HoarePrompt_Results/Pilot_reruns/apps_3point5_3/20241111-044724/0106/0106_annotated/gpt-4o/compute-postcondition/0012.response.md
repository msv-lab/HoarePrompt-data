Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the total time required based on the provided conditions, including determining the time to exit, direct walk time, reverse walk time, time to the target floor, and the total time. The total time is then returned as the output. The function does not specify constraints on the input parameters, so potential edge cases like invalid inputs or unexpected values are not handled explicitly in the code.**
