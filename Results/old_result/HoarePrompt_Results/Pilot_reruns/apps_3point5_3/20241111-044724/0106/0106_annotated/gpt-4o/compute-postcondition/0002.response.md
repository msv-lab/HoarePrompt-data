Example Answer: 
`floor` is assigned the value of `floor_within_block // k + 1`. Since the initial state of `floor_within_block`, `k`, and `floor` is unknown, we cannot determine the exact value of `floor`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000. `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k` and `a` ≠ `b`. `floor` is calculated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000. `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k` and `a` ≠ `b`. `floor` is calculated based on the formula provided**
