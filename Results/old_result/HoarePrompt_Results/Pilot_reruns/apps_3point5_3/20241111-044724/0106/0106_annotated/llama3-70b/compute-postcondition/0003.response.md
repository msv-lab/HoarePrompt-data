Example Answer:
`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, where `a`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers. The value of `a_block` is calculated based on the formula provided. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are assigned integers from user input, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain positive integers within the specified constraints, `a_floor` is a positive integer calculated based on the formula provided, `a_block` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned integers from user input, `n`, `m`, and `k` remain positive integers within the specified constraints, `a_floor` is a positive integer calculated based on the formula provided, `a_block` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`**
