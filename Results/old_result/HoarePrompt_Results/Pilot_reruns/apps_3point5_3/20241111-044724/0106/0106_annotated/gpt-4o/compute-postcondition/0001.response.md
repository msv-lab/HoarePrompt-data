Example Answer:
The variable `floor_within_block` is assigned the value of `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are not directly used in this assignment. Therefore, the output state is:
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000. `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k` and `a` ≠ `b`. `floor_within_block` is calculated based on the formula provided.**
