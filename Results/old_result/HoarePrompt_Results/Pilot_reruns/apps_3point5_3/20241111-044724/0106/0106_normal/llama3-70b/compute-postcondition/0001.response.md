Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. Since the input is split by spaces, the first value goes to `a` and the second value goes to `b`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, `n`, `m`, and `k` are unknown, so the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers**
