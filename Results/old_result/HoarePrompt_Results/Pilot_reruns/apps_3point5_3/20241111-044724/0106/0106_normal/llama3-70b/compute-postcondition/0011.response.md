The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function's functionality is to return the result of the comparison between the sum of `n` and `m` and the product of `k` and the absolute difference between `a` and `b`. Specifically, if the sum of `n` and `m` is greater than the product of `k` and the absolute difference between `a` and `b`, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. 
Functionality: **The function returns True if n + m > k * abs(a - b), otherwise it returns False.**
