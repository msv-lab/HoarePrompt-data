Example Answer:
`time_to_target_floor` is assigned the value of `(floor_b - 1) * 5`. The value of `floor_b` is used in this calculation, but the initial state of `floor_b` is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: If `floor_a` is equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 + (`floor_a` - 1). `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as `(floor_b - 1) * 5`.
