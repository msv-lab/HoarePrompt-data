The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. The variables `floor_a`, `floor_b`, `block_a`, `block_b`, `n`, and `reverse_walk_time` remain unchanged. The variables `time_to_exit` and `time_to_target_floor` are updated based on the given conditions. The variables `direct_walk_time`, `min_walk_time`, and `total_time` are calculated accordingly. The function returns `total_time`.
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, k, a, b. It updates certain variables based on given conditions and calculates direct_walk_time, min_walk_time, and total_time. Finally, it returns total_time**.
