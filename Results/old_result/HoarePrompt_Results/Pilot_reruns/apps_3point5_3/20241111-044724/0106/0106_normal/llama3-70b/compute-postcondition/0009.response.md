Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `a_block` is a positive integer, `b_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `b_block` is calculated based on the given formula, `min_block_time` is calculated based on the formula provided. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. If `b_floor` is greater than or equal to `a_floor`, then `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.***
