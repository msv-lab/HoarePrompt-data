The function func_1 accepts parameters n, m, k, a, b, and calculates the total time required to move from location a to location b in a building with multiple blocks and floors. It determines the time to exit the current block, time to directly walk to the target block, time to walk in reverse to the target block, time to reach the target floor, and then calculates the total time as the sum of these components. The function returns the total_time required for the entire movement process. The function considers various conditions for different floor positions and block distances between the initial and target locations.
