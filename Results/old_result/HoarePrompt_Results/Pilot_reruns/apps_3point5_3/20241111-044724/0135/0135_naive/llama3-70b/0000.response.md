Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if all the remainders are distinct by using a set to keep track of the seen remainders. If a remainder is already in the set, it immediately prints "No". Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set and continues. Finally, if all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes". The program follows the problem description for every potential case and handles all possible inputs.
