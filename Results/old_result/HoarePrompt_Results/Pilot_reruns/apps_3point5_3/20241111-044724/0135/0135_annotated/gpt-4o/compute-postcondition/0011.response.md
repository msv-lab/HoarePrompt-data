According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 4, `k` is greater than 0**
