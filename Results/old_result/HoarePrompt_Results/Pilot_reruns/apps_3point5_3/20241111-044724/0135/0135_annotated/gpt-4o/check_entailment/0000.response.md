Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program accurately implements the problem description. It checks whether all the remainders of division of a number n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. The program uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and returns 'No' if a duplicate remainder is encountered during the iteration. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of the code logic and the conditions under which 'No' is returned. Overall, the code aligns with the problem requirements and covers all potential cases.
