Example Answer:
The code calculates the remainder of dividing `n` by `i` and assigns it to the variable `remainder`. The values of `seen_remainders`, `i`, and `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
