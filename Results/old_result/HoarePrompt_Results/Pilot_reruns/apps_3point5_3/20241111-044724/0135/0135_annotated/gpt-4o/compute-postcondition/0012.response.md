Output State: **If k is greater than 0, the loop will execute k times. After the loop executes, `seen_remainders` will contain all unique remainders of n divided by numbers from 1 to k. If at any point a previously seen remainder is encountered, the loop will return 'No'. If k is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and `seen_remainders` will remain an empty set.**
