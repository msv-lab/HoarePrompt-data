Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k` within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and k ≥ n. 
It returns 'No' if k is greater than or equal to n. 
If k is greater than 0, the loop executes k times. After the loop, `seen_remainders` contains all unique remainders of n divided by numbers from 1 to k. If a previously seen remainder is encountered, it returns 'No'. If k is 0 or negative, `seen_remainders` remains empty.**
