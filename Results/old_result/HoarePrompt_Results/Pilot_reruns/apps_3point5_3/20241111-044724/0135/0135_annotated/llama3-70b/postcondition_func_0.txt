The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, then iterates through integers from 1 to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by each integer. If a remainder is already in the set `seen`, it prints 'No' and exits. If not, it adds the remainder to the set. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. Finally, it prints 'Yes'. Therefore, the function checks for unique remainders of `n` divided by integers from 1 to `k` and prints 'No' if a duplicate remainder is found, 'Yes' otherwise.
