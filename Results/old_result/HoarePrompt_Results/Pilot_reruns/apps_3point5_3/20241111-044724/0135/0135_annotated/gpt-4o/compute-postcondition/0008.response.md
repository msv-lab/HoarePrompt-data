Example Answer: 
The code calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i` and assigns it to the variable `remainder`. The initial state does not provide the value of `n`, so the exact value of `remainder` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
