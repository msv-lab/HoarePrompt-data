Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` and `i` are integers. The value of `n` can be any integer between 1 and 10^18, and `i` is 1. Therefore, the value of `remainder` will always be 0. The state of other variables remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0**
