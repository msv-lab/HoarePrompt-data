Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the result of `n % i`, where `n` is an integer greater than `i` and `i` is 3. The previous values of `n` and `i` are known, but the exact values are not specified. Since `i` is 3, the remainder will be 0 if `n` is even and 1 if `n` is odd. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are integers such that n > k, k is an integer between 1 and 10^18, i is 3, remainder is 0 if n is even, 1 if n is odd.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that n > k, k is an integer between 1 and 10^18, i is 3, remainder is 0 if n is even, 1 if n is odd**
