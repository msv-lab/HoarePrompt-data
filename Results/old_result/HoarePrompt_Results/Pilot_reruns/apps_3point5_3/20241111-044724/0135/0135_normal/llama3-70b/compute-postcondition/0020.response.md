According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and the loop goes up to `k`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the updated value of `remainder`, `i` is 4, and the updated value of `remainder` is not in the `seen` set**
