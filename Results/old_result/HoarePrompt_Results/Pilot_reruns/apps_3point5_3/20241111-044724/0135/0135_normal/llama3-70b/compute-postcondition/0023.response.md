The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function should calculate the result of n^k, where n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, and return the result as an integer. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate the power of n raised to the power of k without any input parameters.
