Postcondition: ***If there is at least one element in the `assigned` set and the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is satisfied for any `x` in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute. After the if else block, the state of the variables remains unchanged based on the initial conditions and assignments.***
