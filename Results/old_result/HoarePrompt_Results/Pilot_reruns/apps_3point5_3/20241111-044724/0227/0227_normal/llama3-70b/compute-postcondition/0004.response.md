According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. The loop variable `i` starts from 1 and goes up to (n-1). Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
