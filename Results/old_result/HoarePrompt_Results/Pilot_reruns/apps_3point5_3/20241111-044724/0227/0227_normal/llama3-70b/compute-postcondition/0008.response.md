Example Answer:
The value of `m` is incremented by 1, where the previous value of `m` is 2. After execution, `m` becomes 3. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is 3, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is 3, `i` is 2**
