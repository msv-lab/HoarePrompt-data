According to the code, the loop can execute since `assigned` is a set and if it's not empty, the loop will run. The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **The element `a[i+1]` is added to the `assigned` set, `can_form` is False, `assigned` is not empty, `x` is the first element in the `assigned` set**
