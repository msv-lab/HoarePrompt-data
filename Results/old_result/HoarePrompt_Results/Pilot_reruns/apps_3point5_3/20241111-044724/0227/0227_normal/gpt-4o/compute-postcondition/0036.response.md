Postcondition: ***At the end of the if statement, `can_form` is True, `assigned` is a set containing `a[i+2]`, `can_form` is True, `assigned` is not empty, and `x` is the third element in the `assigned` set. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, `assigned` retains its previous conditions, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
