Example Answer:
The value of `m` is assigned as 1. Since the smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `m` remains 1. Therefore, the Output State is: The smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `m` is 1.
Output State: **The smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `m` is 1**
