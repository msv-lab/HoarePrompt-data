According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, the element `a[i]` is added to the `assigned` set. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be increased by 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **The element `a[i+1]` is added to the `assigned` set.**
