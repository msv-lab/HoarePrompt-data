The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), and `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9). The function loops through the elements in the list `a` and adds them to the `assigned` set based on certain conditions. If the `assigned` set is empty, the loop will not execute. The variable `can_form` will be True if there exists an element `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If `can_form` is False, the variable `m` will be incremented by 1. After the loop executes, `m` will represent the number of times `can_form` was False during the loop iterations, and the function returns `m`.
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `n` and `a`, where `n` is a positive integer and `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers. It loops through the elements in the list `a`, adding them to the `assigned` set based on certain conditions. If `can_form` is False during the loop iterations, `m` is incremented by 1. The function returns the final value of `m` after the loop execution.**
