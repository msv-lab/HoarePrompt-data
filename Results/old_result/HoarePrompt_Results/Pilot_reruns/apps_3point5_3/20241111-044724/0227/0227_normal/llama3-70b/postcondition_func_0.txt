The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, sorts the list `a` in ascending order, and then iterates through the list to count the number of elements that are not twice the previous element. The function prints out this count if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it relies on user input for `n` and `a`.
