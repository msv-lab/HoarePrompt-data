According to the code, the loop can execute if the set `assigned` is not empty. Before the loop starts, the set `assigned` has at least one element (the smallest positive integer in list `a`), so the set `assigned` is already in a valid state. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `can_form` is False. 
State: **The smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is False**
