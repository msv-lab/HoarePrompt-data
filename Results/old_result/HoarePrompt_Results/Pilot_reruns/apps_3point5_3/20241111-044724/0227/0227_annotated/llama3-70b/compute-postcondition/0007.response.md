According to the code, the loop will execute as long as i is less than n. At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 2, i is 1. If a[i] is not equal to a[i - 1] multiplied by 2, then m is increased by 1.

To execute the loop one more time, the value of i needs to be adjusted. Since i is currently 1, to execute one more time, i should be increased by 1 to be 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 2, i is 2**
