Output State: **If the new element in `assigned` can be formed by subtracting `a[i]` from any element in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True. The values of `n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. The loop is terminated after setting `can_form` to True. If the condition is not met for any element in `assigned`, then `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty or does not contain an element that can be formed by subtracting `a[i]` from any element in `assigned`, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False.**
