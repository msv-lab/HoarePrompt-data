Functionality: **The function accepts an input integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`. It sorts the list `a` in ascending order and then iterates through the list to count the elements that do not follow the pattern where an element is twice the previous element. If `n` is greater than 1 and `a` has at least 2 elements, it prints the count `m` of such elements. If `m` is less than or equal to 23, it prints `m`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not account for the case where `n` is less than 1 or `a` is an empty list.**
