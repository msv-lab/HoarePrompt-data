Correctness: **True**

The code correctly sorts the input list of distinct positive integers in ascending order. It then iterates through the sorted list to count the elements that do not follow the pattern where an element is twice the previous element. The code prints the count `m` of such elements if `n` is greater than 1 and the list has at least 2 elements. If `m` is less than or equal to 23, it prints `m`; otherwise, it prints -1. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and the annotations provide a clear explanation of what each section of code is doing. There are no cases identified where the code does not work as expected.
