According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is 3, `i` is 2. Since `i` is 2, the loop can execute one more time by incrementing `i` by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If `assigned` contains an element that can be formed by subtracting `a[i]` from any element in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True, `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty and has a new element added, `m` is 3, `i` is 3, and `x` is the last element in `assigned**.
