According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than 1. The loop variable i starts at 1 and goes up to n-1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, n must be greater than 1. Before the loop starts, m is 1. So, the state needs to be adjusted to n is greater than 1, i is 1, and m is 1.
State: **n is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 1, i is 1**
