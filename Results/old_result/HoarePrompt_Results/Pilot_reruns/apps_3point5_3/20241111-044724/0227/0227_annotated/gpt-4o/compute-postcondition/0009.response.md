Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True if the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is met, `x` is the first element in `assigned`, and the loop or if statement is broken if the condition is satisfied. If the condition is not met, `can_form` remains False.***
