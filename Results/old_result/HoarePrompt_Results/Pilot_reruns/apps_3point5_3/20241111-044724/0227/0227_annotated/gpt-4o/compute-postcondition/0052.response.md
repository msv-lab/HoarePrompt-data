According to the code, the loop will execute one more time if the condition of the if statement is not met in the previous iteration. At the end of the last iteration, the loop was exited after setting `can_form` to True. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `can_form` needs to be set to False.
State: **If the new element in `assigned` can be formed by subtracting `a[i]` from any element in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True. The values of `n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i`, and `x` remain unchanged. `can_form` is False**
