Example Answer: 
The code prints the value of `result`, which is the third element in the list `results`. As the initial state mentions that `results` has at least 3 elements and `result` is the third element, we can directly print the value of the third element without any further calculations. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `results` has at least 3 elements, `result` is the third element in `results`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `results` has at least 3 elements, `result` is the third element in `results`**
