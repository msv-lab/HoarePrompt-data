Output State: **`prefix_balances` list has at least 1 element, `b` is the first element in `prefix_balances`, `index` is increased by 3, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is calculated, `i` is incremented by 1. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros of length n+1, `count` is 1**
