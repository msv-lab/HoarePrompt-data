Example Answer:
The `results` list appends the value `0` at the end. The list `results` now contains an additional element which is `0`. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of '1's and '0's in the string up to that index, and `results` list contains an additional element with the value `0`.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each element is the cumulative sum of '1's and '0's in the string up to that index, `results` list contains an additional element with the value `0`**
