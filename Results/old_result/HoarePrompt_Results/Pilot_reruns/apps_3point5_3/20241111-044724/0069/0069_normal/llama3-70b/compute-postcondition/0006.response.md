Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(n + 1)` prints the value of `n + 1`. Since `n` is an input integer, the output will be the input integer incremented by 1. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the program prints the value of `n + 1`.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the program prints the value of `n + 1`**
