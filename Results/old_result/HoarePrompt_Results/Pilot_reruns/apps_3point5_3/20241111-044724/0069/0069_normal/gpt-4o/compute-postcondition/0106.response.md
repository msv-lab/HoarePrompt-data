Example Answer: 
The program prints the value of `result`, which is the second element in the list `results`. As `results` has at least 2 elements, and `result` is the second element, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `results` has at least 2 elements, `result` is the second element in `results`**
