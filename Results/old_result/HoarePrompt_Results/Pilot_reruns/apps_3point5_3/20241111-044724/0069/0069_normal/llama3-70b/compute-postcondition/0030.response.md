Postcondition: ***`T-1`, `n`, `x` are positive integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is calculated as cnt0 - cnt1, `s` is assigned the input string, `n` and `x` are positive integers from the input, `cnt0` is calculated by counting the occurrences of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is calculated by counting the occurrences of '1' in `s`, `balance` is calculated as cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints the result of (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1.***
