Output State: **`n` is updated to a new integer value, `results` list contains the appended value of `count`, `T` is greater than the updated current iteration count, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances` list being evaluated in the next iteration, `index` is increased by 3, `prefix_balances` is a list where `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`, and `i` is incremented to 2**
