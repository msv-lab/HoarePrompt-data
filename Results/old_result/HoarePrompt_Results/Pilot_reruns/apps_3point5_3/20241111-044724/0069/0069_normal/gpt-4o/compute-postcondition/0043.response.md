Example Answer:
`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, where `n` is an integer based on the value at `data[index]`. The other variables remain unchanged, and the output state is: `n` is an integer based on the value at `data[index]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `results` remain unchanged, `count` depends on the conditions, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `x` is assigned an integer based on the value at `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value at `data[index + 2]`, and `balance` is calculated as described.
Output State: **`n` is an integer based on the value at `data[index]`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `results` remain unchanged, `count` depends on the conditions, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `x` is assigned an integer based on the value at `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value at `data[index + 2]`, and `balance` is calculated as described**
