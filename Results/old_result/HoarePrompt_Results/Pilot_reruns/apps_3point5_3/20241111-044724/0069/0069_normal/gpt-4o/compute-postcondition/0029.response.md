Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer initialized to 0, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least two elements, and `b` is the second element in the list. If (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0, then `count` is increased by 1. All other variables remain unchanged after the execution of the if statement.***
