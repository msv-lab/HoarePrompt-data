Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` list has at least 3 elements, `b` is the third element in `prefix_balances`, `index` is increased by 3, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is calculated, `i` is incremented by 1, `count` is 3. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, `count` is increased by 1.***
