The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input and then processes `T` test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n` and `x`, and a binary string `s` from input. It calculates the balance between the counts of '0' and '1' in the string. Depending on the balance and `x` value, it prints different results. If the balance equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. The function handles scenarios where `n` is not positive, where `x` is out of the specified range, and processes each test case accordingly. The function does not return any specific value.
