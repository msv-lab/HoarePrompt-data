Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The value of `index` is not given, so we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is updated to a new integer value, `results` list contains the appended value of `count`, `T` is greater than the updated current iteration count, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is not calculated yet, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances` list being evaluated in the next iteration.
