Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is the current iteration count. Depending on the value at index in `data`, `n` can take that value. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer based on the value at data[index], `prefix_balances` and `results` remain unchanged, `count` depends on the conditions and `T` is greater than the current iteration count.
Output State: **`n` is an integer based on the value at data[index], `prefix_balances` and `results` remain unchanged, `count` depends on the conditions, and `T` is greater than the current iteration count**
