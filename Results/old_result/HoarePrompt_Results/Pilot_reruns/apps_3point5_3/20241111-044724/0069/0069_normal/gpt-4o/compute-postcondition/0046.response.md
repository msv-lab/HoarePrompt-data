According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` should be adjusted to `n` is greater than or equal to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `results` remain unchanged, `count` depends on the conditions, `T` is greater than the current iteration count, `x` is assigned an integer based on the value at `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value at `data[index + 2]`, and `balance` is calculated as described**
