Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, n and x are input integers, s is a string from input, cnt0 contains the count of '0' characters in s, cnt1 contains the count of '1' characters in s, balance is calculated as cnt0 - cnt1, s is the input string, cnt0 and cnt1 are assigned the count of '0' and '1' characters in s respectively. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, -1 is printed. Otherwise, (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1 is printed. The program handles all possible edge cases related to the division operation and provides the correct output based on the input variables and their relationships.***
