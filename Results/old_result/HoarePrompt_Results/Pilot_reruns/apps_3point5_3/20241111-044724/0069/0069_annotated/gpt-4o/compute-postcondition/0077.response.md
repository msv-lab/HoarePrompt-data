Output State: **`data` is a list, `index` is an updated index, `n` is an integer, `x` is an integer value obtained from `data[index + 1]`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `balance` is the result of the subtraction of counts of '1's and '0's in string `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of n + 1 zeros, `i` is 1 to n + 1, `prefix_balances` is updated where `prefix_balances[i]` is calculated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the condition `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
