According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than or equal to 1. The loop iterates from 1 to n+1, so it requires at least 1 iteration to execute. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute:
State: **T is a positive integer, `index` is 4, `results` has a capacity of at least T elements, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the list `data` and n is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the list `data`, `s` is the integer value at index 3 of the list `data`, `balance` is the result of the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of size n+1 initialized with zeros**
