According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `n` is an integer greater than 0. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Additionally, since the loop updates `prefix_balances[i]` based on the calculation provided, `prefix_balances[i]` needs to be updated accordingly.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `(n + 1)`, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `x` may or may not be in `prefix_balances`, `n` is an integer greater than 0, `index` is increased by 3, `i` is 3, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the calculation `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1`**
