Postcondition: ***If n is at least 1, the loop will iterate n times, updating prefix_balances based on the subtraction of counts of '1's and '0's in string s. After the loop executes, prefix_balances will contain the cumulative sum of the differences calculated in each iteration. If n is less than 1, prefix_balances will remain a list of n + 1 zeros. In either case, after the if-else block executes, results will contain either -1 or 0 based on whether x is in prefix_balances. Additionally, if balance equals 0, results will be updated with -1 if x is in prefix_balances, and 0 otherwise.***
