Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute and update `prefix_balances` based on the cumulative sum of the balance calculated for each element in the `s` list. `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `x` may or may not be in `prefix_balances`, `index` is increased by 3 after the loop. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop won't execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of `(n + 1)`. `count` is assigned the value 0.**
