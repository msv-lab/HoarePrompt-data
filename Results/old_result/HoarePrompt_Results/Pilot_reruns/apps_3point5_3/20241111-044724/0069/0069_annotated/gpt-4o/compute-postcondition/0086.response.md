Postcondition: ***If n is at least 1, the loop will execute n times, updating the values in prefix_balances based on the subtraction of counts of '1's and '0's in string s. After the loop executes, prefix_balances will contain the cumulative sum of the differences calculated in each iteration. If n is less than 1, the loop will not execute and prefix_balances will remain a list of n + 1 zeros. In either case, after the if-else block executes, results will contain either -1 or 0 based on whether x is in prefix_balances.***
