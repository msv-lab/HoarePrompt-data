Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the sequence of k positive numbers that sum up to n with the maximum possible greatest common divisor. It first calculates the minimum sum of a sequence of k numbers using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2. If this minimum sum is greater than n, it returns -1 which is correct according to the problem description. 
If the minimum sum is less than or equal to n, it calculates the multiplier d such that d * min_sum <= n. It then calculates the remainder and adjusts the sequence to incorporate the remainder in order to achieve a sum of n. 
The program outputs the resulting sequence correctly and handles all the possible cases as described in the problem statement.
