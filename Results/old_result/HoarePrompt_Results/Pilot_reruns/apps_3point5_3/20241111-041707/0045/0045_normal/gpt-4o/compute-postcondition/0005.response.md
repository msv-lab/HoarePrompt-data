Example Answer:
The list `sequence` is created with elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`. The values of `d`, `n`, and `min_sum` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`.
Output State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`**
