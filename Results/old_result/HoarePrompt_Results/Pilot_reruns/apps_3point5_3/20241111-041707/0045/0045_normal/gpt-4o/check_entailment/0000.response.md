Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input and calculates a sequence of `k` positive numbers such that their sum is equal to `n` and the greatest common divisor is maximal.
- The function `func_1` calculates the minimum sum of the sequence as `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2`, and if this sum is greater than `n`, it returns -1 which follows the problem description.
- It then calculates the value of `d` as the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, and the remainder as `n - d * min_sum`.
- The sequence list is created based on `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`.
- If there is a remainder, the function increments elements from the end of the sequence list until the remainder becomes 0.
- The function returns the updated sequence list or -1 if no valid sequence is found.
- The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement and handles cases as expected.
