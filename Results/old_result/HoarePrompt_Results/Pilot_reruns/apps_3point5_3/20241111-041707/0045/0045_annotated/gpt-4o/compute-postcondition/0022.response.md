Output State: **If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. If `remainder` is 0, the loop breaks immediately. After the loop executes, `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`; `remainder` is the result of `n` minus `d` times `min_sum` minus the number of iterations done; `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1) + the number of iterations done` for all `i` in the range `k` in reverse order.**
