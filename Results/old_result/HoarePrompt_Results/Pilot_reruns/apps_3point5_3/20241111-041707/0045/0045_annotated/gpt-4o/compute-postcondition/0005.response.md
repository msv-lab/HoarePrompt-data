Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` represents the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. `remainder` is the result of `n` minus `d` times `min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1)` for all `i` in the range `k`.**
