Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value `b` while `b` is assigned the value `a % b`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, after the execution, `a` will hold the previous value of `b` and `b` will hold the remainder of the division of the previous values of `a` and `b`. 
Output State: **`a` holds the previous value of `b`, and `b` holds the remainder of the division of the previous values of `a` and `b`**
