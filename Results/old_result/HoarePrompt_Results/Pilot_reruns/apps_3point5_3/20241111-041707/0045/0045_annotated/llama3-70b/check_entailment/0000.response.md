Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided code defines a function that calculates the greatest common divisor of two positive integers using the Euclidean algorithm. The function works correctly as described in the problem statement. It takes two positive integers as input, calculates their greatest common divisor, and returns the result. The annotations provided in the code explain the logic behind the Euclidean algorithm and how it ensures the correct calculation of the greatest common divisor. 

Since the function correctly implements the logic to calculate the greatest common divisor, it aligns with the requirements of the problem description. The function can be used as a helper function in a larger program that aims to generate a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers with a given sum and maximal greatest common divisor.
