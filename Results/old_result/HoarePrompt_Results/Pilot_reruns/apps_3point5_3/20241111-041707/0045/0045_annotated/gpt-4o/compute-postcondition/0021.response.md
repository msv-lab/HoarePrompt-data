According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range of `k-1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`; `remainder` is the result of `n` minus `d` times `min_sum` minus 1; `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1) + 1` for all `i` in the range `k`; Index `i` is -1.

To execute the loop one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `remainder` needs to be decremented by 1.
- The value at index `i` in the `sequence` list needs to be incremented by 1.
