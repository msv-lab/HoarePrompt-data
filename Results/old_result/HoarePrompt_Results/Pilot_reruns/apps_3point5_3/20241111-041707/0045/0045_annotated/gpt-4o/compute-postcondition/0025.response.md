Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. It calculates the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`. If this minimum sum is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it iterates through a sequence list based on certain conditions and returns that list. If the remainder reaches 0 during iteration, the loop breaks immediately.**
