Example Answer: 
The function returns `a`, which holds the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `a` and `b`. Since `b` holds 0 initially, the loop doesn't execute, and the function directly returns the value of `a`. Therefore, the output state is `a` holds the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `a` and `b`, `b` holds 0, and the function returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `a` and `b`.
Output State: **`a` holds the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `a` and `b`, `b` holds 0, and the function returns the greatest common divisor of the initial values of `a` and `b`**
