Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated by dividing `n` by `min_sum`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `min_sum` are not changed in this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` represents the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` represents the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1**
