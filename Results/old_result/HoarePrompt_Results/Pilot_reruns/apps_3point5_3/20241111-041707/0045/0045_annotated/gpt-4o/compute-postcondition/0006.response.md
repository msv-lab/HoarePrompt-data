According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, we need to adjust the states such that:
- `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10
- `min_sum` represents the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`
- If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1
- `remainder` is the result of `n` minus `d` times `min_sum`
- `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1)` for all `i` in the range `k`
- For the loop to execute, the index `i` in the loop should start from `k - 1`, go down to 0, and iterate in reverse order.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the minimum sum of numbers from 1 to `k`; `remainder` is the result of `n` minus `d` times `min_sum`; `sequence` is a list containing elements `d * (i + 1)` for all `i` in the range `k`; Index `i` starts from `k - 1` and goes down to 0 in reverse order**
