Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are integers. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, `shares` and `r` are updated accordingly. In both cases, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
