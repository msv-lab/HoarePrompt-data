Example Answer:
The variable `total_bourles` is calculated by multiplying `max_shares` with `max_sell_price` and adding `remaining_bourles`. The values of `max_shares`, `max_sell_price`, and `remaining_bourles` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `max_shares` is the maximum number of shares that can be bought, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is the calculated value.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified range, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`, `max_shares` is the maximum number of shares that can be bought, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is the calculated value**
