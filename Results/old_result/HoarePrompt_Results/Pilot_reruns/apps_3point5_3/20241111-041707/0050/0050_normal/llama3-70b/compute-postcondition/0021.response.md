According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `i` should be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are integers**
