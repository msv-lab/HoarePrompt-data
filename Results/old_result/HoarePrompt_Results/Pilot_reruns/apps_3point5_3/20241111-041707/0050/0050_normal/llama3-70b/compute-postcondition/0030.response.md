Example Answer: 
The value of `shares` is updated to 0. Since `shares` is greater than 0, the calculation `shares * b[i]` will result in 0. The values of `s` and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `shares` is 0, `s` and `b` remain unchanged, and `r` is 0.
Output State: **`shares` is 0, `s` and `b` remain unchanged, `r` is 0**
