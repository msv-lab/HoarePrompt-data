Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `s` and `b` remain unchanged, `r` is updated based on the previous iteration, `i` is less than `m`. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by `shares` times the value at index `i` of array `b`, and `shares` is reset to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the loop or if statement is exited.***
