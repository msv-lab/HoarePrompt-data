Example Answer:
The list `b` is created by converting the input list of integers `s` into a list of integers using the `map` and `int` functions. Since the initial state does not provide the values of `s`, the output state will include the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and the newly created list `b`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `s` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `b` is a list of integers created from `s`**
