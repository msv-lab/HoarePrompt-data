Postcondition: ***`shares` is greater than 0, `s` and `b` remain unchanged. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated to the sum of `r` and the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the code breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. In all cases, `s` and `b` remain unchanged after the execution of the if else block.***
