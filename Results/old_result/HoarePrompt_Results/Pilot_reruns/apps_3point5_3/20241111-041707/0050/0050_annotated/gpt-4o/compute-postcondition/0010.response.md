Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. If the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, the program prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, the program calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining money after the purchase of those shares, and the total amount of money after selling those shares. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `min_buy_price`, `max_sell_price`, `max_shares`, `remaining_bourles`, and `total_bourles` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.***
