Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `m` and `r` are integers between 1 and 30, `s` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers sorted in descending order. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and updating `r` to the remainder of the division. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the loop. Ensure that the program handles all potential edge cases within the specified ranges and conditions.***
