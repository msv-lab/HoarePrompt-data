Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the list of integers obtained by splitting the input. Since the input is not specified, the values in the list `s` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list of integers obtained from input**
