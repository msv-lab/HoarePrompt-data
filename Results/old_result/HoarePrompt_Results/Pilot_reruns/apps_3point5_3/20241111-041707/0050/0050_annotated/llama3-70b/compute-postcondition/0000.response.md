Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from the input after splitting them. The input is expected to have three integers separated by spaces. As per the precondition, `n`, `m`, and `r` will be integers between 1 and 30. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30**
