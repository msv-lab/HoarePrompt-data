Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `s` is not empty, `shares` is 0, `r` is updated if shares > 0 by adding the product of shares and b[i], `i` is incremented by 1, `m` is greater than 0, `s` has at least one element. If shares > 0, `shares` is reset to 0. If shares <= 0, `r` remains unchanged, `i` is still incremented by 1, `m` is still greater than 0, and the loop or if statement is exited.***
