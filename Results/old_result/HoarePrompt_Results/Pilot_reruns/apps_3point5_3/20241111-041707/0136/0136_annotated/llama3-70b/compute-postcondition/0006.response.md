Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeroes. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, the program prints '>'. This covers all possible comparisons between `a` and `b` when they are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeroes.***
