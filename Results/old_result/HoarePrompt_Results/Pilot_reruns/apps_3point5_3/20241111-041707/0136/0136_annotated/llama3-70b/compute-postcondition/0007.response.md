The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function processes two non-negative integers, `a` and `b`, represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits and may contain leading zeroes. The function then performs a specific operation based on the values of `a` and `b` and returns a certain result. However, since no specific operation or result is provided in the constraints, the exact functionality of the function cannot be determined without further information.
