Correctness: **True**

The program reads two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b` from user input, removes leading zeros, compares them, and prints '<' if `a` is less than `b', '>', if `a` is greater than `b', or '=', if they are equal. The code covers scenarios where `a` or `b` are empty after removing leading zeros by assigning '0' in those cases. It handles cases where one number has more digits than the other correctly, as well as cases where the numbers are equal. The code annotations accurately describe the flow of the program and the handling of different cases. Additionally, the program meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
