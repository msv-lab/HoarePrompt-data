Example Answer:
The value of `b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` after removing any leading zeros. The previous value of `b` is unknown, and the value of `data[1]` is not specified. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is assigned a value after removing leading zeros from `data[0]`, `b` is assigned a value after removing leading zeros from `data[1]`.
Output State: **`a` is assigned a value after removing leading zeros from `data[0]`, `b` is assigned a value after removing leading zeros from `data[1]`**
