Example Answer: 
The value of `b` is assigned the value of the input string after removing any leading zeros. Since `b` is assigned the input string without leading zeros, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros**
