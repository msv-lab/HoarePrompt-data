Postcondition: ***`a` is the first element of `data` list with leading zeros stripped. If `a` is an empty string, it is reassigned to '0'. `b` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits. If `b` is not already assigned a value, it is reassigned to '0'. If `a` is greater than `b`, then print '>'. Otherwise, print '='. This covers all cases including the edge cases where `a` is empty or `b` is not assigned a value.***
