Example Answer:
The value of `a` is assigned the value of the first element of the `data` list after stripping any leading zeros. The previous values of `a` and `b` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the first element of `data` list with leading zeros stripped, `b` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` is the first element of `data` list with leading zeros stripped, `b` is a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits**
