Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly reads two non-negative integers represented as strings `a` and `b` and removes any leading zeros. It then compares the two numbers and prints the appropriate symbol ('<', '>', or '=') based on the comparison. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases, including cases where the numbers are equal, when one number is less than the other, and when one number is greater than the other. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that it accurately handles the comparison of the two numbers. Overall, the code is correct for the given problem description.
