According to the code, the loop execution depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k-1`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `(total_days - i)`, `denominator` is `total_days` times the previous value of `denominator`, `n` is a valid integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` is less than `k-1, `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `(total_days - i)`, `denominator` is `total_days` times the previous value of `denominator`, `n` is a valid integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` is less than `k`, `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, `i` is incremented by 1**
