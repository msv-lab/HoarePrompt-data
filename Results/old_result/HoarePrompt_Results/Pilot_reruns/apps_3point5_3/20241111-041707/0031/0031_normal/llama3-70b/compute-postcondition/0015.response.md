Example Answer:
If k is at least 2, `numerator` is divided by `gcd`. The value of `numerator` and `denominator` is calculated based on the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: If k is less than 2, the loop does not execute; If k is at least 2, `numerator` and `denominator` are calculated, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, and then `numerator` is divided by `gcd`.
Output State: **If k is less than 2, the loop does not execute; If k is at least 2, `numerator` and `denominator` are calculated, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, and then `numerator` is divided by `gcd`**.
