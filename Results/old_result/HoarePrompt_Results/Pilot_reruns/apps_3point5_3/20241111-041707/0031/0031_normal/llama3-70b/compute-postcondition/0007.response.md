Example Answer:
`numerator` is multiplied by `total_days - i`. The value of `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, and `i` is less than `k-1`. Therefore, the output state is: `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `(total_days - i)`, `denominator` is `total_days` times the previous value of `denominator`, `n` is a valid integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` is less than `k-1`.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `(total_days - i)`, `denominator` is `total_days` times the previous value of `denominator`, `n` is a valid integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` is less than `k-1`**
