Example Answer:
`numerator` is assigned the value 1. MOD is 1000003, and `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, but the value of `n` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is 1.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is 1**
