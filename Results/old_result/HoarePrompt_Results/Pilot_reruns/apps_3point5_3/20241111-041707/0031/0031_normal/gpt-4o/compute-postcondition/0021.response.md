Example Answer:
`A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, which is the same as the value of `p_no_shared`. The values of `numerator`, `denominator`, and `p_total` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` and `denominator` values based on loop condition, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is equal to `denominator`, and `p_shared` is calculated based on the formula, `A` is equal to `p_no_shared`.
Output State: **`numerator` and `denominator` values based on loop condition, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is equal to `denominator`, and `p_shared` is calculated based on the formula, `A` is equal to `p_no_shared`**
