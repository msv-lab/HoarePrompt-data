Example Answer:
`numerator` is assigned the value `1`, and no other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; total_days is 2 raised to the power of n; numerator is 1.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; total_days is 2 raised to the power of n; numerator is 1**
