Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints mention that if `k` is less than 2, the loop should not execute. However, in the code, the loop is still executed even when `k` is less than 2. This means that the code does not handle the case where `k` is less than 2 as per the problem description. Therefore, the correctness of the code is false.
