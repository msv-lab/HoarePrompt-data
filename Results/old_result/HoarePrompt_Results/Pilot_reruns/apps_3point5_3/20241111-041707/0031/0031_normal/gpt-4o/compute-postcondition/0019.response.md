Example Answer:
`p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, and `numerator` and `denominator` values are not provided. `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, but since the value of `numerator` is not given, the output state is: `numerator` and `denominator` values based on loop condition, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is equal to `denominator`.
Output State: **`numerator` and `denominator` values based on loop condition, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is equal to `denominator`**
