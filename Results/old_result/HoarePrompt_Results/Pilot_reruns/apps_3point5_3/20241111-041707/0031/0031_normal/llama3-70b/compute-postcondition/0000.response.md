Example Answer:
`total_days` is assigned the value of 2 raised to the power of `n`. Given that `n` can be any integer between 1 and 10^18, the value of `total_days` will be 2 raised to the power of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; total_days is 2 raised to the power of n.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; total_days is 2 raised to the power of n**
