Example Answer:
`p_shared` is calculated as the result of the formula `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`, where `p_total` is the value of `denominator`, and `p_no_shared` is the value of `numerator`. The specific values of `numerator` and `denominator` are not provided, so the output state is: `numerator` and `denominator` values based on loop condition, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is equal to `denominator`, and `p_shared` is calculated based on the formula.
Output State: **`numerator` and `denominator` values based on loop condition, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is equal to `denominator`, and `p_shared` is calculated based on the formula**
