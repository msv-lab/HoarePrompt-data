Example Answer: 
`denominator` is assigned the value of 1. The previous values of `total_days`, `numerator`, and `MOD` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1**
