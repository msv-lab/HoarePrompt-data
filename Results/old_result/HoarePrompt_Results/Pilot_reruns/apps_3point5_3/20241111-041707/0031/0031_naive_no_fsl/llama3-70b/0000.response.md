Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people having the same birthday in a 2^n day year. It uses the formula for calculating probabilities and reduces the fraction to its simplest form by finding the greatest common divisor. The program then correctly outputs the values of A and B modulo 10^6 + 3. The logic seems to be correct and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
