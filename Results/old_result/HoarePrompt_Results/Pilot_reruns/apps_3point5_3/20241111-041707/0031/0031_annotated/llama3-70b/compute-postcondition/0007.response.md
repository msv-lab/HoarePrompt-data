Example Answer:
`numerator` is multiplied by the value of `total_days - i`, where `total_days` is calculated based on the value of `n`, and `i` is less than `k`. The value of `n` is between 1 and 10^18, `k` is at least 2, and `total_days` is calculated based on the value of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: n is an integer between 1 and 10^18, k is an integer at least 2, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, denominator is updated, and i is less than k.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^18, k is an integer at least 2, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, denominator is updated, i is less than k**
