The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The function does not have a return value if `k` is greater than 1 left shifted by `n`, in which case it prints 1 and 1 before returning. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers n and k satisfying specific constraints. If k is greater than 1 left shifted by n, the function prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, the program variables remain unchanged.**
