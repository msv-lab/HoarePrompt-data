Example Answer:
`total_days` is assigned the value of `2**n`, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18. The value of `total_days` is calculated based on the value of `n`. Since `n` can be any integer between 1 and 10^18, the value of `total_days` can vary accordingly based on the value of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 10^18, k is an integer between 2 and 10^18, total_days is calculated based on the value of n.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 10^18, k is an integer between 2 and 10^18, total_days is calculated based on the value of n**
