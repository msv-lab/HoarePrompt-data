According to the code, the loop can execute as long as k is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, n is a non-negative integer and k is a positive integer, but the loop will only execute if k is greater than 1. Additionally, since the loop starts from 1, i should start at 1 as well. So, the states that need to be adjusted are: n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1**
