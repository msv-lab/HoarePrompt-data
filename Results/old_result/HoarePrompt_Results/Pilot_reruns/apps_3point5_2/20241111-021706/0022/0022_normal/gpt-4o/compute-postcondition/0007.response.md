Since the loop iterates until `i` reaches `n // 2`, the loop will execute one more time if `i` is less than `n // 2` at the end of the previous iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of only English letters, |s| is an integer, n is greater than or equal to 2, and i is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **s is a string consisting of only English letters, |s| is an integer such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000, n is greater than or equal to 2, i is 2**
