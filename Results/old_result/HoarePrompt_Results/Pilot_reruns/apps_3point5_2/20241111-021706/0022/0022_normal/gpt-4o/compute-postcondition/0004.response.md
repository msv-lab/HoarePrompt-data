According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of only English letters, |s| is an integer such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000, n is greater than or equal to 2, i is 0. 

To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since the loop goes till `n // 2`, the new value of `i` should be 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **s is a string consisting of only English letters, |s| is an integer such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000, n is greater than or equal to 2, i is 1**
