Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string `s` of length between 1 and 1000, consisting only of English letters. It then checks if the string is a palindrome by comparing characters from the beginning and end. If the string is a palindrome, it prints 'TAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NIE'. The function does not accept any parameters, and it does not handle cases where the input string is empty or contains non-letter characters.**
