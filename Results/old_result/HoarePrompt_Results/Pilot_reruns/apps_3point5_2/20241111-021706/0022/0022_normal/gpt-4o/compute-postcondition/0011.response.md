Output State: **The loop checks if the characters at symmetric positions in the string are equal. If any pair of characters doesn't match, it returns False. The loop continues until it reaches the middle of the string (n // 2). If the string has an odd length, the middle character will not be compared. If the string is empty or consists of the same character throughout, the loop does not execute. If the loop completes without finding any mismatch, it means the string is a palindrome.**
