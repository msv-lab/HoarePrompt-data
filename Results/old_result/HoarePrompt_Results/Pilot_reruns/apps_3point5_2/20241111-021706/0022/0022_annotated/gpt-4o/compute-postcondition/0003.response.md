Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an even integer between 2 and 1000. If the character at index `i` in `s` does not match the character at index `n - 1 - i`, then the function returns False. This condition covers all possible cases of comparing characters at symmetric positions within the string `s`.***
