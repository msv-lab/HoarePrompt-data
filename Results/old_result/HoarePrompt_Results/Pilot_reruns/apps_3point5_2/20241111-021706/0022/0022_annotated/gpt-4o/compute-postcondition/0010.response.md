According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2 - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an even integer between 4 and 1002, and `i` is less than `n // 2 - 1`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be equal to or greater than `n // 2 - 1`.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an even integer between 4 and 1002, `i` is equal to or greater than `n // 2 - 1`**
