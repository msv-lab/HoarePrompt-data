According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is broken.

To execute one more time, the next iteration should be for the next pair of characters to be compared. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 1**
