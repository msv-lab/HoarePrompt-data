The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It also accepts an even integer `n` between 2 and 1000. 

Case_1: If the character at index `i` in `s` does not match the character at index `n - 1 - i`, then the function returns False. This condition covers all possible cases of comparing characters at symmetric positions within the string `s`. If `n` is odd, the loop does not execute.

Case_2: If the character at index `i` in `s` does not match the character at index `n - 1 - i`, then the function returns False. This condition covers all possible cases of comparing characters at symmetric positions within the string `s`. If `n` is odd, the loop does not execute.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, and an even integer `n` between 2 and 1000. It then checks if the characters at symmetric positions within the string match, and returns False if they do not.
