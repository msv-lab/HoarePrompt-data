According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an even integer between 2 and 1000. To execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `i` is incremented by 1, the condition `i` less than `n // 2` implies that `n` needs to be increased by 2 to maintain the loop condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, `n` is an even integer between 4 and 1002**
