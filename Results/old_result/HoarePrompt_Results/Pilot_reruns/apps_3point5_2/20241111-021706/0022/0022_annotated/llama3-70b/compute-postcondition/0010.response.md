Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_spalindrome` is False, `i` is 1 and the loop terminates. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. The conditions described above encompass all possible scenarios after the execution of the if statement.***
