Example Answer:
The code calculates `n - n % 10`, which essentially removes the last digit of `n` by finding the remainder when dividing `n` by 10 and subtracting that from `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, the result will always be the value of `n` with the last digit removed. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9**
