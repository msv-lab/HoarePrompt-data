Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the rounding logic described in the problem statement. It checks if the input number `n` is divisible by 10, in which case it directly prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it then checks if the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5. Based on this condition, it correctly rounds `n` to the nearest multiple of 10. The annotations also confirm that the code covers all possible cases and outcomes as described in the problem statement. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are handled correctly by the program. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases within the specified range of `n` (0 to 10^9).
