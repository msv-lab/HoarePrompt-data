Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly implements the rounding logic as described in the problem description. It calculates the last digit of the input number `n`, and then based on whether this last digit is less than or equal to 5 or greater than 5, it adjusts the result by subtracting or adding the difference between 10 and the last digit. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides a correct output for each case. The annotations also align with the logic of the code and do not introduce any conflicting scenarios. Therefore, the program is correct.
