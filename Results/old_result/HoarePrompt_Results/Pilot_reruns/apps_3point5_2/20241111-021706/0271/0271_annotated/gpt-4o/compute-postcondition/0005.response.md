Example Answer:
The value of `result` is calculated based on the value of `n` and `remainder`. Since `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, it can be either less than or equal to 5 or greater than 5. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is calculated as `n - remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is calculated as `n + (10 - remainder)`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, and `result` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is the last digit of `n`, and `result` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned**
