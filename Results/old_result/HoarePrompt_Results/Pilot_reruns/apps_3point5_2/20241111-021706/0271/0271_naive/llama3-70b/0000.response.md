Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly implements the logic to round the input number to the nearest integer that ends with 0. It checks if the input number ends with 0, in which case it is already rounded. If not, it determines the nearest rounded integer by checking if the last digit is less than or equal to 5, then subtracts the remainder to get the rounded number, and if the last digit is greater than 5, then adds the difference to get the rounded number. The program covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output.
