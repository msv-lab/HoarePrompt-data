Postcondition: ***`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n % 10 is equal to 0, the result of the expression `print(n)` is n. If n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, the result of the expression `print(n - n % 10)` is a multiple of 10. If n % 10 is greater than 5, the result of the expression `print(n + (10 - n % 10))` is between n+1 and n+10.***
