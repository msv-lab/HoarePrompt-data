Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the value `n + (10 - remainder)`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is between 0 and 9, the value of `result` will be the sum of `n` and `10 - remainder`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is between 0 and 9, result is the sum of n and (10 - remainder).
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is between 0 and 9, result is the sum of n and (10 - remainder)**
