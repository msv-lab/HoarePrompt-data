Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, the value of `remainder` will be between 0 and 9 inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is between 0 and 9.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is between 0 and 9**
