Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that if there are more people upvoting than downvoting, the result should be "+"; if there are more people downvoting than upvoting, the result should be "-"; otherwise, the result should be "0". If there are multiple possible results due to the unknown votes, then the result should be "?" to indicate uncertainty.

However, the code in its current state does not handle the case where there are equal numbers of upvotes and downvotes (i.e., x = y). In this case, the correct result should be "0" according to the problem description, but the code does not account for this scenario.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
