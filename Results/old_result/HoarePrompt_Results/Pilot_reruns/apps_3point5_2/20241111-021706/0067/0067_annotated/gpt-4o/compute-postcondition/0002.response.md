Example Answer:
`max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, where `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers. Since `x` and `z` are non-negative integers, the value of `max_upvotes` will be the sum of `x` and `z`. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`.
Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `y` and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z**`
