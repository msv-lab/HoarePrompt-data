Correctness: False

The program does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The annotations mention that if `x` is not equal to `y`, the program prints '?', which is incorrect according to the problem description. The problem description states that if `x` is not equal to `y`, the result should be uncertain. However, the program does not handle this case correctly and simply prints '?' without considering the uncertainty. 

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not adhere to the problem description for all potential cases.
