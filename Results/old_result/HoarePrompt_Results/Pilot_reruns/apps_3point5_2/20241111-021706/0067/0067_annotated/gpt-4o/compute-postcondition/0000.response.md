Example Answer:
`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input by spaces and converting them to integers. As x, y, and z are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the values of x, y, and z will be within this range after execution. Therefore, the Output State is: x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **x, y, and z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
