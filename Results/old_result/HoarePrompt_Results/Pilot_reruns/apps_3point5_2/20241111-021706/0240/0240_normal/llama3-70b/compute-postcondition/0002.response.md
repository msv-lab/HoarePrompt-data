According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in string `s`. The loop can execute if `s` is not empty. Additionally, since `t_set` contains unique characters from string `t`, it might be used to check certain conditions within the loop. The variable `n` being an empty string does not affect the loop execution directly.

Therefore, for the loop to execute, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is an empty string**
