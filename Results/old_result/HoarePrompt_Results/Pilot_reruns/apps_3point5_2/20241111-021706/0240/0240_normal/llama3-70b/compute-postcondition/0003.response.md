Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `c`. The existing value of `n` is empty, and the new value of `c` is added to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string containing the value of `c`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string containing the value of `c`**
