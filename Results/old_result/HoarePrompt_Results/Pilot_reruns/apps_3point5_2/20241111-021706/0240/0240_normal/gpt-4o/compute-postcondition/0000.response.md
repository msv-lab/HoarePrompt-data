According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `chars` and `permutations`. If `chars` is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `sub` being a string representing the remembered substring of n does not directly affect the loop execution. So, for the loop to execute, `chars` needs to be a non-empty string representing the shuffled digits of the number n.
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing the shuffled digits of the number n, `sub` is a string representing the remembered substring of n**.
