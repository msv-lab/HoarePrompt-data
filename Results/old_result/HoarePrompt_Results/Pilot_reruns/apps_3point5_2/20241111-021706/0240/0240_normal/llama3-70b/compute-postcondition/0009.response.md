Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is updated by adding the character `c`. The specific value of `c` is not given, but it is assumed to be a character from the remaining characters in string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with more characters left to iterate, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string updated with the next character from `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with more characters left to iterate, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string updated with the next character from `s`**
