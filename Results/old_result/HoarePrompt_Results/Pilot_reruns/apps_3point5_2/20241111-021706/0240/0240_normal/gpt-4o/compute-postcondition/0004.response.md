According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more permutations of the characters in `chars` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string representing the shuffled digits of the number n, `sub` is a string representing the remembered substring of n. To execute the loop one more time, the next permutation of `chars` needs to be considered.
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing the next permutation of the digits of the number n, `sub` remains the same as remembered substring of n**
