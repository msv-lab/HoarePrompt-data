Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `c`, resulting in a new value for `n`. The states of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string with more characters left to iterate, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is an updated string.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string with more characters left to iterate, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is an updated string**
