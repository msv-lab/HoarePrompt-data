The function is_valid_number accepts two parameters, num_str and sub. It checks if the substring sub is present in the num_str and if the length of num_str is equal to n_len. The function returns True if both conditions are met, otherwise it returns False. However, the code does not handle cases where n_len is not equal to the actual length of num_str, which could lead to incorrect results.
