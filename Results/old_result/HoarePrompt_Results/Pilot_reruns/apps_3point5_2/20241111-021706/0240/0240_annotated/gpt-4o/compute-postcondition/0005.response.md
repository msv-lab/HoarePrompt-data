Example Answer:
`candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together as a string. The values of `chars` and `perm` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` and `perm` are adjusted to the next permutation for the next iteration, `candidate` is the joined string of `perm`.
Output State: **`chars` and `perm` are adjusted to the next permutation for the next iteration, `candidate` is the joined string of `perm`**
