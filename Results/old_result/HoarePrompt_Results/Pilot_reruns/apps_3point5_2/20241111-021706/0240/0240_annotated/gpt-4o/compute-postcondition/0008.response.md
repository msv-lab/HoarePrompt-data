According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if the next permutation of `chars` and `perm` is generated, and the `candidate` string is updated accordingly. Additionally, the `candidate` string needs to be checked with the `is_valid_number` function using `sub` as a parameter.

At the end of the previous iteration, `chars` and `perm` have been adjusted to the next permutation, and `candidate` is the joined string of `perm`. To execute one more time, the next permutation of `chars` and `perm` needs to be generated again, and `candidate` should be the joined string of the new `perm`. Finally, the `candidate` string should be checked with the `is_valid_number` function using `sub` as a parameter to determine if the loop can execute again.

State: **`chars`, `perm` are adjusted to the next permutation for the next iteration, `candidate` is the joined string of the new `perm`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then the function yields `candidate`**.
