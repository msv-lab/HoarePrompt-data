Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two string parameters s and sub. It decrements character counts from s based on sub_counter, generates possible numbers from the remaining characters, finds the smallest number from possible_numbers, and returns it. If sub_counter is empty, the function returns the smallest number directly from s. **
