According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters in the string `s`. The variables `s`, `t`, and `t_set` are given, but they are not directly related to the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, you need to adjust the state so that `s` is not an empty string.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string representing a very large integer, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters of `t`**
