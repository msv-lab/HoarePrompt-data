Output State: **The loop generates permutations of the characters in `chars` and checks if each permutation is a valid number using the `is_valid_number` function with the `sub` substring. If the condition is met, the loop yields the candidate. If `chars` is an empty string or `sub` is not a valid substring of `chars`, the loop will not execute, and no changes will occur to the variables.**
