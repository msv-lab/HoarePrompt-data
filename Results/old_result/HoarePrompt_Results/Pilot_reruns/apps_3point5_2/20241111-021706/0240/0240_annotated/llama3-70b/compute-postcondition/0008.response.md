Since the loop depends on the characters in the string `s`, the next iteration will depend on the next character in `s` that has not been processed yet. At the end of the previous iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, and `t_set` is a set containing unique characters of `t`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next character `c` in `s` should be considered. If `c` is not in `t_set`, then the loop will execute again. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` should move to the next character that has not been processed yet.
- If `c` is not in `t_set`, then `n` should be updated by adding `c`.

State: **`s` moves to the next character in the string, if `c` is not in `t_set` then `n` is updated by adding `c`, `t` and `t_set` remain the same**
