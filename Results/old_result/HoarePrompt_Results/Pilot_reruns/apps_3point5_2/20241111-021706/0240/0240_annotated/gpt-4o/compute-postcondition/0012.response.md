According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the validity of the `candidate` string. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, the loop will yield `candidate` for the next iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` and `perm` have been adjusted to the next permutation for the next iteration, and `candidate` is the joined string of the new `perm`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the new `perm` needs to be generated, and `candidate` needs to be the joined string of this new `perm`.
State: **`chars`, `perm`, `candidate` have been adjusted for the next permutation**
