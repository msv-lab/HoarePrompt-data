Example Answer:
If the set `t_set` is empty, the loop will not execute, and `n` will remain empty. If the set is not empty, the loop will iterate through each character `c` in the string `s`. If `c` is in `t_set`, it will be appended to `n`. The variables `s` and `t` remain unchanged. After the loop, the function returns the integer value of `n`. 
Output State: **If the set `t_set` is empty, `n` is empty. If not, `n` contains characters from `s` that are in `t_set`.**
