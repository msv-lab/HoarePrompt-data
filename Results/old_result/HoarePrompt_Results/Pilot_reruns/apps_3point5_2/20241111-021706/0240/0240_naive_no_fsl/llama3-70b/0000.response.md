Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t` that Vasya remembers. It then iterates through the characters in `s`, checks if the character is in the set of characters in `t`, and appends it to the result string `n`. Finally, it adds the substring `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of `n`. The program follows the problem description accurately by constructing the smallest possible initial integer `n` based on the given inputs. The logic of the program seems correct and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected based on the problem description.
