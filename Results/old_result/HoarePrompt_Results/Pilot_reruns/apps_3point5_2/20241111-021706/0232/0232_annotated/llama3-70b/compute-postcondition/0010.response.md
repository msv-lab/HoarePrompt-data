Postcondition: ***`colors` is a list of integers based on the input with at least one more color, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `color_counts` contains the updated counts for each color. If the color mentioned in the code is not already present in `color_counts`, it is added with a count of 0. This ensures that all colors mentioned in the input have an entry in `color_counts`, even if their count is initially set to 0.***
