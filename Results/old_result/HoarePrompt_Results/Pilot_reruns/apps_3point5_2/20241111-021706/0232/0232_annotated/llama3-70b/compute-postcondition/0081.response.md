According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. Before the loop starts, the conditions to adjust are:
1. `colors` is not empty.
2. `n` is greater than `i`.
3. `found` is False at the end of the previous iteration.
4. `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.
5. `j` is equal to `i`.

State: **`colors` is not empty, `n` is greater than `i`, `found` is False at the end of the previous iteration, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `j` is equal to `i`**
