Example Answer:
The value of `color_counts[color]` is set to 0. This means that the count of the specified `color` is reset to 0. The rest of the counts for other colors remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of integers based on the input with at least one more color, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, and `color_counts` contains the updated counts for each color where the count of the specified `color` is reset to 0.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers based on the input with at least one more color, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, and `color_counts` contains the updated counts for each color where the count of the specified `color` is reset to 0**
