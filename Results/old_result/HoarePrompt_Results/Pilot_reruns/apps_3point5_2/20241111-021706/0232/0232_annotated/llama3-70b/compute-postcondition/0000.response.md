Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`, which splits the input into a list of integers and assigns the first value to `n` and the second value to `m`. Since the input is not specified, the specific values of `n` and `m` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: **Precondition**: **n and m are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n. colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. counts is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ ∑_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n.**
