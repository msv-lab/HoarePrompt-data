Example Answer:
The value of `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` is not already a key in `color_counts`, a key-value pair is added with the color as the key and the value set to 0. All other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of integers based on the input, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `color_counts` contains the updated counts for each color.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers based on the input, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `color_counts` contains the updated counts for each color**
