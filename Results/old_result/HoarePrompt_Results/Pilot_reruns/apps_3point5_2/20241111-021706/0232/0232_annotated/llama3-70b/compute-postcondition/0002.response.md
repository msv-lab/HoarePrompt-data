Example Answer:
The `counts` list is populated with integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers. The values of the `colors` list are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of integers based on the input, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers based on the input, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split**
