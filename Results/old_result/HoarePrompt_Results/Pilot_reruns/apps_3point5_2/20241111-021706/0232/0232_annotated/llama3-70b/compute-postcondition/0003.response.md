Example Answer: 
An empty dictionary `color_counts` is created. Since this operation does not affect the existing variables, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers based on the input, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input split, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**
