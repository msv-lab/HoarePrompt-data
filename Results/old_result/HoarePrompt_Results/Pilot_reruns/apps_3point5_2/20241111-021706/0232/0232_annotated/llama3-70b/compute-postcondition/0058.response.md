Postcondition: ***`colors` is not empty, `n` is greater than `i`, `counts` is not empty, `window_counts` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then after the execution of the if statement, `window_counts` will have an entry for `color` with a value of 0. If `color` is already in `window_counts`, the dictionary remains unchanged. `found` is True after the execution of the if statement.***
