Postcondition: ***If `colors` is not empty and `n` is greater than `i`, the loop will execute. After the loop executes and if `found` is True, the loop will break. As a result, `window_counts` will be a dictionary containing the count of each color in the specified range. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` will be True. If `colors` is empty, `n` is less than or equal to `i`, or `counts` is empty, the loop will not execute and the state of the variables will remain unchanged.***
