According to the code, the loop can execute if 'i' is less than 'n'. The loop index 'j' starts from 'i' and goes up to 'n-1'. Since 'j' is within the range of 'i' and 'n', the loop can execute. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **'colors' is a list of colors with at least 1 color, 'found' is either True or False, 'j' is an integer within the range of 'i' and 'n', 'color' is assigned a color value from the 'colors' list, 'color_counts' is an empty dictionary, 'window_counts' is an empty dictionary, 'i' is incremented by 1, 'i' is less than 'n', 'j' is equal to 'i'**
