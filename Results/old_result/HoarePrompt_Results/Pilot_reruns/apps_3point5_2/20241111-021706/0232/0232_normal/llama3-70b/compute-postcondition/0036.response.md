Postcondition: ***If the loop executes, 'window_counts' dictionary updates the count of the 'color' key by incrementing it by 1. If all the counts in 'window_counts' dictionary values match the corresponding counts in 'counts' list after sorting, 'found' is set to True, and the loop breaks. Otherwise, there are no changes to the variables and the loop continues.***
