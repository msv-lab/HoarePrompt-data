Example Answer:
`current_counts` is initialized as an empty defaultdict with default value 0. No other variables are affected by this initialization. Therefore, the Output State is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys are numbers from 1 to `m` and values are taken from the list `k`; `current_counts` is an empty defaultdict with default value 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys are numbers from 1 to `m` and values are taken from the list `k`; `current_counts` is an empty defaultdict with default value 0**
