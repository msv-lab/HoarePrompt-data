**Precondition**: **n is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights. m is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers. The subsequent n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} represent the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights. The m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} represent the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, and the sum of these integers is less than or equal to n.**
