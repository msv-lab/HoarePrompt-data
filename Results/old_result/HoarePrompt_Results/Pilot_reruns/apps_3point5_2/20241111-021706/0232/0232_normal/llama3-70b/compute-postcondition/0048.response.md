Postcondition: ***'colors' is a list of colors with at least 1 color. 'found' is either True or False. 'j' is an integer within the range of 'i' and 'n'. 'color' is assigned a color value from the 'colors' list. 'color_counts' and 'window_counts' are empty dictionaries. If 'found' is True, the loop breaks and the program exits. If 'found' is False, the loop continues iterating through the colors list until the specified condition is met.***
