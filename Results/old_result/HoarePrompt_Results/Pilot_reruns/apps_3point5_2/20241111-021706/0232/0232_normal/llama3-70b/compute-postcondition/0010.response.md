Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers. `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys for each possible color, initially set to 0 for all colors and updated for the colors processed. `colors` is a list of colors with at least 1 color. After the execution of the if statement, if the color is not already in `color_counts`, it is added to the dictionary with a value of 0. All other colors in the dictionary remain unchanged.***
