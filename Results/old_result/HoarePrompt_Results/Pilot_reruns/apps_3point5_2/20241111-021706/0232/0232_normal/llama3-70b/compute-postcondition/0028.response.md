Postcondition: ***If there are no colors in the 'colors' list, the loop won't execute. 'color_counts' and 'window_counts' are empty dictionaries. 'n' and 'm' are positive integers. 'colors' is a list of colors with at least 1 color. 'found' is True. 'j' is equal to 'i'. 'color' is assigned the value of colors[j]. 'window_counts' dictionary now contains the key 'color' with a value of 1. The loop breaks when all counts in 'window_counts' match the corresponding targets in 'counts'.***
