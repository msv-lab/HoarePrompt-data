Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary with keys ranging from 1 to `m` and values from list `k`, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `n` is greater than 0. The values in `current_counts` for corresponding keys in `desired_counts` are NOT equal. If all the values in `current_counts` for the keys in `desired_counts` are equal, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
