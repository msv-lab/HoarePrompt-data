Postcondition: ***'colors' is a list of colors with at least 1 color, 'found' is True if all counts in 'window_counts' match the corresponding target counts in 'counts', 'j' is equal to 'i' + 2, 'color' is assigned a color value from the 'colors' list, 'color_counts' is an empty dictionary, 'window_counts' is updated to have 'color' as a key with a value of 1, 'i' is incremented by 1, 'i' is less than 'n', 'j' is less than 'n', 'n' is greater than or equal to 'i', 'color' is assigned the color at index 'j' from the 'colors' list. If all counts in 'window_counts' match the corresponding target counts in 'counts', 'found' is set to True and the loop breaks.***
