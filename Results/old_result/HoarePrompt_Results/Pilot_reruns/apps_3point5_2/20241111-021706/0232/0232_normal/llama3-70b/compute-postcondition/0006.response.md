Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers. `color_counts` is a dictionary with keys for each possible color, initially set to 0 for all colors. `colors` is a list of colors with at least 1 color. If the color is not already in the `color_counts` dictionary, it is added with a value of 0. The state of the program after the execution of the if statement ensures that all variables maintain their initial state, with the addition of the color to the `color_counts` dictionary if it was not present before.***
