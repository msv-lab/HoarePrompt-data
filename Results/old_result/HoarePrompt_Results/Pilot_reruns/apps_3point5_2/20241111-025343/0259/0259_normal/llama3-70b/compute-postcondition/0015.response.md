According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the buses list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. At the start of the loop, min_time is set to infinity and ans is set to -1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the buses list must have at least 1 element, and i is 0, s and d are the values of the first element in the buses list.
State: **`min_time` is set to `float('inf')`, `ans` is set to -1, buses is a list of elements with at least 1 element, i is 0, s and d are the values of the first element in the buses list**
