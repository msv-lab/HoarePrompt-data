Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples. `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the first tuple in `bus_routes`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. After the execution of the if statement, `min_wait_time` is updated to the minimum value between the current `wait_time` and the previous `min_wait_time`. `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1` representing the index of the chosen route with the minimum wait time. The initial values and calculations for `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` are maintained and adjusted accordingly based on the conditions met in the program fragment.***
