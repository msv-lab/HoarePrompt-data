Example Answer:
The `wait_time` is calculated as the difference between `s_i` and `t`. The value of `s_i` is assigned from the next tuple in `bus_routes`, and `t` is a positive integer. Therefore, the `wait_time` is determined by the specific values of `s_i` and `t`. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated, `chosen_route` is the index of the chosen route with the minimum wait time, `i` is incremented by 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the next tuple in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is calculated based on specific values of `s_i` and `t`.**
