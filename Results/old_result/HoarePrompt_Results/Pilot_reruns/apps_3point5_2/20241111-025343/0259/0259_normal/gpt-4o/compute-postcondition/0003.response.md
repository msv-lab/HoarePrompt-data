Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the tuple at index `i` of `bus_routes`. Since `i` is 0, the values of `s_i` and `d_i` will be the first tuple in the list `bus_routes`. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the first tuple in `bus_routes`.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, t is a positive integer, bus_routes is a list of tuples, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1, i is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the first tuple in `bus_routes`**
