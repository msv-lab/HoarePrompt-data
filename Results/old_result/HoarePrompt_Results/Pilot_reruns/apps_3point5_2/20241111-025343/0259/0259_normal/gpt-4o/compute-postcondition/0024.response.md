Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`, where `s_i` and `t` are positive integers. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so the output state is: `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1` are positive integers and a list of tuples, `s_i`, `d_i` are positive integers, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.
Output State: **`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1` are positive integers and a list of tuples, `s_i`, `d_i` are positive integers, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`**
