Correctness: **True**

The code reads the input for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. Then, it reads the input for each bus route's start time and frequency. It calculates the minimum time difference for each bus arrival, identifies the bus with the earliest arrival time, and prints out its index plus 1. The code handles all cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output based on the given inputs. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
