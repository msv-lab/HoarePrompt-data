Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` will be greater than or equal to the number of times the loop executed, `t` will be an integer within the specified range, `buses` will contain tuples `(s, d)` added each time the loop executed, where `s` and `d` are integers assigned from the input after splitting. If `n` is less than 1, the loop will not execute and `buses` will remain an empty list.**
