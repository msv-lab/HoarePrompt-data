Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting it into integers. The previous values of `s` and `d` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is an integer within the specified range, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)` that was appended to it, `s` and `d` are integers assigned from the input after splitting.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `t` is an integer within the specified range, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)` that was appended to it, `s` and `d` are integers assigned from the input after splitting**
