Functionality: **The function `func` reads input for the number of buses and time, then reads input for each bus's start time and frequency. It calculates the minimum time difference for each bus arrival, identifies the bus with the earliest arrival time, and prints out its index plus 1. If there are no buses, it prints -1. The function does not return any value.**
