Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes, time Serval goes to the station, and the details of each bus route.
2. The `func_1` function correctly calculates the wait time for each bus route based on the time Serval goes to the station and the intervals between buses.
3. The function then determines the chosen route based on the minimum wait time and correctly returns the chosen route.
4. The main program correctly reads the input, calls the `func_1` function, and prints the output.
5. The program accounts for the condition where if several buses arrive at the same time, any of them can be printed as the answer.
6. The logic of selecting the route with minimum wait time based on the given constraints is correctly implemented. 

Overall, the program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
