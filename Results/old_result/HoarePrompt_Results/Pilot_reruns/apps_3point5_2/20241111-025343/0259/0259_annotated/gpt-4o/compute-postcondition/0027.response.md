Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the recalculated minimum value, `chosen_route` is the recalculated index, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the source of the bus route at index 2 which is updated after assignment to the source of the bus route at index 2 in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the destination of the bus route at index 2 which is updated after assignment to the destination of the bus route at index 2 in `bus_routes`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
