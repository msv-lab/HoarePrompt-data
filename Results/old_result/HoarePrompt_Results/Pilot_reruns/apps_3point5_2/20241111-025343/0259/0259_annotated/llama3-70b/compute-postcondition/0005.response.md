According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `_` should be less than `n+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains one tuple, `s` and `d` have user input values**
