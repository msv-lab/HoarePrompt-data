According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the variables that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
