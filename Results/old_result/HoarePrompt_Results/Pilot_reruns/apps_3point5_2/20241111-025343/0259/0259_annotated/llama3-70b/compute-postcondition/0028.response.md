Example Answer: 
The variable `ans` is assigned the value `i + 1`, where `i` is 0, so `ans` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` represent the values of the third tuple in the list, `min_time` is the minimum of the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d` and the current value of `min_time`, `ans` is 1, `time` is the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d`, `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 3 tuples, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` represent the values of the third tuple in the list, `min_time` is the minimum of the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d` and the current value of `min_time`, `ans` is 1, `time` is the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d`, `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`**
