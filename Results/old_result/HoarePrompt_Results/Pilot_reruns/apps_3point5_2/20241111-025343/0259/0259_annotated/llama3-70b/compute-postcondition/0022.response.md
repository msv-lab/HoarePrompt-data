Example Answer: 
`min_time` is assigned the value of `time`, and `time` is the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d`. Therefore, `min_time` now holds the same value as `time`. The other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` represent the values of the second tuple in the list, `min_time` is the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d`, `ans` is set to `i + 1, `time` is the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d`**
