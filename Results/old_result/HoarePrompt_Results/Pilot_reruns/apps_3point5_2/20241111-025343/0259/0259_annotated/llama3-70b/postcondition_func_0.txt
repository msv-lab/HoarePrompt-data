The function `func` reads input values `n` and `t` as positive integers, and then reads `n` pairs of integers as input to populate a list `buses`. It calculates the minimum time based on the given formula and prints the corresponding index `i + 1`. If `n` is 0, no input is read, and the list `buses` remains empty. The function does not explicitly return any value.
