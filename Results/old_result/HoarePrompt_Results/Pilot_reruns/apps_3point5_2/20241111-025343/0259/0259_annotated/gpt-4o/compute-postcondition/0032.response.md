According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the recalculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is the recalculated index, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the source of the bus route at index 2, `d_i` is the destination of the bus route at index 2, and `chosen_route` is 3. Since `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` to 3.

State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the recalculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is the recalculated index, `i` is 3, `s_i` is the source of the bus route at index 3, `d_i` is the destination of the bus route at index 3, `chosen_route` is 3**
