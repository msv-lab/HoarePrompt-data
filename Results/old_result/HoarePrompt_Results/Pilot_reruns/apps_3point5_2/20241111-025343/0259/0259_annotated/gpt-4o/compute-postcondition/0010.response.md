Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is `i + 1`, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of the current bus route, `d_i` is the destination of the current bus route. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
