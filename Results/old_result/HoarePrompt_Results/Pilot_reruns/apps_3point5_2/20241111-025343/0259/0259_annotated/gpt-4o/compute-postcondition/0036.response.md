Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts parameters n, t, and bus_routes. It iterates through the bus_routes to calculate the minimum wait time and determine the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time. If n is at least 1 and bus_routes is non-empty, it correctly computes the minimum wait time and chosen route index. However, if n is less than 1 or bus_routes is empty, the function does not handle this case as expected based on the annotations. In such scenarios, the function should explicitly return that the input is invalid or handle these edge cases appropriately. **
