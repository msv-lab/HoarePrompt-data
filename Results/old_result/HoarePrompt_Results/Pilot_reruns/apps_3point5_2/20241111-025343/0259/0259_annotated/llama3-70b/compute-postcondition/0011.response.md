According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer + 1. To execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer + 2, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` and the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`**
