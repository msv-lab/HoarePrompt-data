Example Answer:
`dist1` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, where `max_pos` is `n-1`. Since `n` is in the range 2 to 100, `max_pos` will be in the range 1 to 99. Therefore, the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos` will be `max_pos`. Hence, `dist1` is assigned the value of `max_pos`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, each integer being in the range from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` holds the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is assigned the value `n-1`, `dist1` is assigned the value of `max_pos`**
