Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` representing the size of the permutation, followed by a list `a` of `n` distinct integers.
- It then calculates the maximum distance between the indices of 1 and `n-1` in the list `a` by finding the positions of the minimum element (integer 1) and the maximum element (integer n).
- The code correctly determines the distance between the minimum and maximum elements by calculating the absolute differences between their positions.
- The maximum distance is then calculated using the four possible combinations of distances between the minimum and maximum elements and the ends of the list.
- Finally, the code prints the maximum distance as the output.
- The code handles the edge cases where the minimum and maximum elements are already at the ends of the list, ensuring that the maximum distance is correctly calculated.
- The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the code follows the problem description for all potential cases.
