Example Answer:
The code prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`. The output will be the maximum of these two values. The initial state values of `n`, `a`, `pos1`, `posn`, `max_dist`, and `min_dist` do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of element `n` in list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum value calculated based on the given formula, `min_dist` is the minimum value calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of element `n` in list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum value calculated based on the given formula, `min_dist` is the minimum value calculated based on the given formula**
