Correctness: **False**

The given program does not always provide the correct output for all potential cases. One such example is when the minimum element is at the beginning and the maximum element is at the end of the array, and the distance is already maximum. In this case, the program will not make the optimal swap but will output the unnecessary distance. 

For example, for the input:
6
6 5 4 3 2 1

The correct output should be 5, as the distance between the minimum and maximum elements is already maximum. However, the program will output 6.
