Example Answer:
The code calculates the maximum distance between `pos1` and `posn` by taking the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`. The maximum distance is then printed. No variables are changed in this process. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`, `posn` is the index of the maximum value in the list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum distance between `pos1` and `posn`, `min_dist` is the minimum distance between `pos1` and `posn`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`, `posn` is the index of the maximum value in the list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum distance between `pos1` and `posn`, `min_dist` is the minimum distance between `pos1` and `posn`**
