Example Answer:
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, and `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, and `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, and `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`**
