Example Answer:
`dist1` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and the value of `max_pos`. The value of `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`. The initial state mentions that `n` is between 2 and 100, so the value of `n` is known. The initial state also mentions that `a` is a list of integers, but the specific values in the list are not provided. `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, but the value of `min_pos` is not used in this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`**
