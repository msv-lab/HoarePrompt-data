Example Answer: 
The variable `dist3` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and the index of the first occurrence of 1 in the list `a`. The previous values of `min_pos` and `a` are used to calculate `dist3`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`, and `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of the first occurrence of `n` in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1 - max_pos`, and `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`**.
