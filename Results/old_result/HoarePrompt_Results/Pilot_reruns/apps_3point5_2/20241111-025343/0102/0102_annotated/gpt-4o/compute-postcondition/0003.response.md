Example Answer:
The function returns the value at the index `n` in the list `ones`. Since `n` ranges from 0 to 99, the returned value corresponds to the ones place digit of `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, and the function returns the ones place digit of `n`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, and the function returns the ones place digit of `n`**
