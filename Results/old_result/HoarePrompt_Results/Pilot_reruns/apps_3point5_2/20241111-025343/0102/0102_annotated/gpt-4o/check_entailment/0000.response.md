Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program accurately converts an integer score between 0 and 99 into words as described in the problem description. The program uses arrays to store the English words for numbers 0 to 9, teens (11 to 19), and tens (10, 20, 30, ..., 90). It then checks the input integer against these arrays to determine the corresponding word representation. The conditions and logic within the program correctly handle all the potential cases outlined in the problem description. Additionally, the code annotations provide a clear explanation of the program's functionality, which aligns with the problem requirements. Therefore, the program is correct and outputs the expected word representation for any valid input within the specified range.
