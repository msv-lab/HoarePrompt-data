Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts an integer n such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. It returns the ones place digit of n if n is between 0 and 9, the corresponding value from the 'teens' array if n is between 11 and 19, the value at the tens place of n from the 'tens' array if n is divisible by 10, and a combination of the tens and ones place values if n is not divisible by 10. For all other cases, the function does not return anything.**
