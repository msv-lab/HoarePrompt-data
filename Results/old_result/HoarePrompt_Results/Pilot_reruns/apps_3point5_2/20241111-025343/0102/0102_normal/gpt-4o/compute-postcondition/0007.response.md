Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 0 and 99, `ones` is a list containing strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places in numbers. If `n` is a multiple of 10, then the function returns the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list. Otherwise, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list and the string representing the ones place of `n` from the `ones` list separated by a hyphen.***
