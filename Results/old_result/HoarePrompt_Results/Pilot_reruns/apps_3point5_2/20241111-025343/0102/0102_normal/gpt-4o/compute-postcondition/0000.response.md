Example Answer:
The list `ones` is initialized with strings representing numbers from zero to nine. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list containing strings representing numbers from zero to nine.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list containing strings representing numbers from zero to nine**
