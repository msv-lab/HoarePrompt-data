Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A, then iterates over the divisors of the gcd to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A.

The program handles all potential cases as it considers all possible combinations of i and j in the given range, and correctly calculates the maximum divisor that can divide every element of A. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all inputs and potential cases.
