Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`, which already contains 1 and the integer division result of x by 1. Since `x` is a perfect square, the new divisor `i` is also added to the set. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set that contains 1, the integer division result of x by 1, and `i`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set that contains 1, the integer division result of x by 1, and `i`**
