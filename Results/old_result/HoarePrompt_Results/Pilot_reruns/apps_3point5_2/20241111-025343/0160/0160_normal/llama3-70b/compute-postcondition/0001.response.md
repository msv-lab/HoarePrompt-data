Example Answer:
The list `A` is assigned the values entered by the user after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values in the list `A` will depend on the user input. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A contains the values entered by the user as integers.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A contains the values entered by the user as integers**
