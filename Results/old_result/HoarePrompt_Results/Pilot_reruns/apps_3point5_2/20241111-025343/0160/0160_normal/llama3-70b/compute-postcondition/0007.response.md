According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `A` contains user-entered integers, `gcd` is recalculated based on the values in `A`, `i` is 2. Since `i` is 2, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `A` contains user-entered integers, `gcd` is recalculated based on the values in `A`, `i` is 3**
