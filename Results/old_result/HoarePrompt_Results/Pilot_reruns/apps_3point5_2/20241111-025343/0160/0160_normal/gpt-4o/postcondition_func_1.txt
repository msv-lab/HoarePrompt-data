The function func_2 accepts a positive number x and calculates its divisors. It then returns a sorted list of these divisors in reverse order, including 1 and x. The function correctly iterates through all numbers from 1 to the square root of x to find divisors. If x is not a positive number, the loop will not execute as expected.
