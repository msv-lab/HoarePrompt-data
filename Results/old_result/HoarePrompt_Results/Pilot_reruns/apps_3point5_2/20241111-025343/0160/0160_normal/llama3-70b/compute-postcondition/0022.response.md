According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is 2 or greater, `gcd` is a positive integer greater than 1, and `i` is 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be one more than its current value. 

State: **N is 2 or greater, gcd is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 3**
