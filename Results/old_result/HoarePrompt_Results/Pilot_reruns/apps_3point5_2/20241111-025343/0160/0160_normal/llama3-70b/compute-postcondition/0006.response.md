Example Answer:
The `gcd` is recalculated by finding the greatest common divisor between the current value of `gcd` and the element at index `i` in list `A`. The value of `i` is 2, so the `gcd` is updated accordingly. The output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `A` contains user-entered integers, `gcd` is recalculated based on the values in `A`, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is an integer between 0 and 10^9, `A` contains user-entered integers, `gcd` is recalculated based on the values in `A`, `i` is 2**
