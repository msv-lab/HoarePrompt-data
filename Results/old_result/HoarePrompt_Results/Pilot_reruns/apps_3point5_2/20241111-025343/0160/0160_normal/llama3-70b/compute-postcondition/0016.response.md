Postcondition: ***N is 2 or greater, gcd is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 1. If gcd % i == 0, max_divisor is updated to be the maximum between its previous value and i. If i * i is not equal to gcd, max_divisor is updated to be the maximum between its previous value and the integer division of gcd by i.***
