Postcondition: ***N is 2 or greater, gcd is a positive integer greater than 1, i is 3. If gcd is divisible by i, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and the floor division of gcd by i if i * i is not equal to gcd. Otherwise, the values of N, gcd, i, and max_divisor remain unchanged.***
