Example Answer:
The variable `multiplier` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` is a non-negative integer up to 8. The value of `k` can be any integer from 0 to 8, so the value of `multiplier` will be calculated based on the value of `k`. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; multiplier is calculated based on the value of k.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; multiplier is calculated based on the value of k**
