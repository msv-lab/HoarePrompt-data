Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k` where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. It calculates a value `x` based on the input parameters and returns it. The calculation involves finding a multiplier based on the value of `k` and using it to compute `x`. The function does not have any specific postconditions or edge cases mentioned in the annotations.**
