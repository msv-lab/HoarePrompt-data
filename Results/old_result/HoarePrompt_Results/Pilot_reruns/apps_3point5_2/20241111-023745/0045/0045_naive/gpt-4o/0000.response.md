Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program calculates the minimum possible sum for a strictly increasing sequence using the formula k * (k + 1) // 2.
2. It then checks if the minimum sum is greater than the given number n. If it is, it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
3. It calculates the common divisor d by dividing n by the minimum sum.
4. It then calculates the remainder left after forming the sequence with common divisor d.
5. It creates the sequence by multiplying the common divisor with increasing numbers from 1 to k.
6. It distributes the remainder among the sequence elements starting from the end to maximize the greatest common divisor.
7. The program outputs the resulting sequence if it exists, otherwise, it outputs -1.
8. The program uses integer division and handles the distribution of remainder correctly to form a strictly increasing sequence with maximum greatest common divisor.
