Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic described in the problem. It calculates the minimum sum of a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers, then checks if the input sum n is greater than or equal to the minimum sum. If it is, it calculates the common divisor and then constructs the sequence accordingly. The program outputs -1 if there is no possible sequence.

The program handles all potential cases and follows the problem description accurately.
