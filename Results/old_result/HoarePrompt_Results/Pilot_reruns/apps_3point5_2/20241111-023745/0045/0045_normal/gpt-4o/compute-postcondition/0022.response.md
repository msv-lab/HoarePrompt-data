Output State: **If `k` is at least 1 and `n` is at least `min_sum`, the loop will decrement `remainder` by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0. At that point, the loop breaks. The elements in `sequence` will be modified accordingly. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1 and the loop does not execute.**
