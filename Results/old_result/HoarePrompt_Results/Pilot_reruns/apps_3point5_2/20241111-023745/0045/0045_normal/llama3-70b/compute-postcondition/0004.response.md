Example Answer:
`a` is now assigned the previous value of `b` after the modulo operation, `b` is now assigned the result of `a % b`. This means `a` will have the previous value of `b`, and `b` will have the result of the modulo operation between `a` and `b`. 
Output State: **`a` is now assigned the previous value of `b`, `b` is now assigned the result of `a % b`**.
