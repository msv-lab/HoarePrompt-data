Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input and calculates the minimum possible sum `min_sum` of a sequence of `k` positive numbers.
- If the `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
- If `min_sum` is less than or equal to `n`, it proceeds to calculate the sequence by dividing `n` by `min_sum` to get the common divisor `d` and the remainder.
- It then creates the sequence by multiplying each element by `d` and distributes the remainder in a balanced manner among the elements.
- The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the given requirements.
