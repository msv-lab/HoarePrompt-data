The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The precondition is that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

Case_1: If `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, and if `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

Case_2: If `k` is at least 1 and `n` is at least `min_sum`, the loop will decrement `remainder` by 1 each iteration until it reaches 0. At that point, the loop breaks. The elements in `sequence` will be modified accordingly. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1 and the loop does not execute.

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and based on the conditions described above, return -1 if `min_sum` is greater than `n`, otherwise modify `sequence` elements accordingly until `remainder` reaches 0.
