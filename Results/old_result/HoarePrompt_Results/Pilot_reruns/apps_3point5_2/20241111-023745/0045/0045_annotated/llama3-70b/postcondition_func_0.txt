The function accepts two positive integers a and b, and iteratively calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b using the Euclidean algorithm until b becomes 0. It then returns the value of a, which is the GCD of the initial values of a and b. The function does not handle cases where a or b is 0.
