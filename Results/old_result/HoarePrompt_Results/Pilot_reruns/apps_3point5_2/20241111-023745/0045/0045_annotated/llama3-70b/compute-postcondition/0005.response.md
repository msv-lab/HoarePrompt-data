According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is truthy (i.e., not equal to 0), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the new values of `a` and `b` after the operation are provided. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the value of `b` needs to be adjusted so that it is still truthy after the operation. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The new values of `a` and `b` after the operation**
