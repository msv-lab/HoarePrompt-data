According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the variable `b` is true (non-zero). At the end of the previous iteration, the values of `a` and `b` are unknown, and we know that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

Since `b` is the condition for the loop to continue, we need to ensure that `b` remains true after the previous iteration. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to `b`. 

State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, and the new values of `a` and `b` are unknown**
