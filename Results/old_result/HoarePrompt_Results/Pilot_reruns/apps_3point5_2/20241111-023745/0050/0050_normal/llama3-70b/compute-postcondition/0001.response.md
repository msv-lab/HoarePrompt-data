Example Answer: 
The list `s` is assigned the values from the input split into integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are assigned the values from the input split into integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned the values from the input split into integers**
