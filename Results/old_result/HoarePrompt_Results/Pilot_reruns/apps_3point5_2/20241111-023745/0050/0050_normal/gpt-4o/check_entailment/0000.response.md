Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values and calculates the minimum buying price and maximum selling price.
- It then checks if the maximum selling price is less than or equal to the minimum buying price, and if so, it prints the initial investment `r`.
- Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the initial investment, the remaining money after buying those shares, and the total money after selling all shares.
- Finally, it prints the total amount of money, which is the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening.
- The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the examples provided.
