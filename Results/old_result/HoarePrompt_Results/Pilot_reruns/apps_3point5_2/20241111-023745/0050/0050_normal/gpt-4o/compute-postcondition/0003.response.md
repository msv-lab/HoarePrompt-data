Example Answer:
The variable `min_buy_price` is assigned the minimum value in the list `b`, denoted by `min(b)`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `b`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `b`**
