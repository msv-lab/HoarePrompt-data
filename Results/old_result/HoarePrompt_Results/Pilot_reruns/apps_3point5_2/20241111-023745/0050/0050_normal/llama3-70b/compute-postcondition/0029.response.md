Example Answer: 
`r` is incremented by `shares * b[i]`. The values of `n`, `r`, and `i` are known, but the value of `shares` and `b[i]` are not provided in the initial state, so their impact cannot be calculated. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated based on shares and b[i], `i` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated based on shares and b[i], `i` is 1**
