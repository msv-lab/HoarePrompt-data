According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated based on shares and b[i] if shares is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `shares` is set to 0**
