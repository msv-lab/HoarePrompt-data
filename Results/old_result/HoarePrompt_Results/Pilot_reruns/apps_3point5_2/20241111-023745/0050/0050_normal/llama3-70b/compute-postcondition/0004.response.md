Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in ascending order with the `sort` method, and the `reverse=True` parameter sorts it in descending order. Therefore, the list `b` is now sorted in descending order. The states of the other variables (`n`, `m`, `r`) remain unaffected.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `b` is a list containing those values sorted in descending order**.
