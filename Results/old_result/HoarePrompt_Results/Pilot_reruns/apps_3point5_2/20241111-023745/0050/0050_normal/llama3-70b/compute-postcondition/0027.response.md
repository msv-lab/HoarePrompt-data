Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to the first element of `s`, `i` is 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated to include the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the loop breaks and the program exits the most internal loop or if statement.***
