Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `r` to the console. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers, `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `b`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`. The output state remains the same as the variables are not modified by the code snippet.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers; `b` is a list of integers; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in the list `b`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list `b`**
