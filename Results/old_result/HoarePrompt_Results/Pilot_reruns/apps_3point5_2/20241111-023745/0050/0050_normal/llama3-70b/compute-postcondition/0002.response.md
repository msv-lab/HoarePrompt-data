Example Answer: 
A list `b` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned to the elements of the list `b`. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `r` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `b` is a list containing those values.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are assigned the values from the input split into integers; `b` is a list containing those values**
