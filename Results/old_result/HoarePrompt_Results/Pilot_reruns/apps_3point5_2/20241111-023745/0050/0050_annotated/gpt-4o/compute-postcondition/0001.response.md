Example Answer:
The list `s` is assigned the result of converting the input string split by spaces into integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers**
