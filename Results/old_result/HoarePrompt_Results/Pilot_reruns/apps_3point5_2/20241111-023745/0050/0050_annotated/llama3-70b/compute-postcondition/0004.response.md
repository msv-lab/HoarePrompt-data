Example Answer: 
The list `b` is sorted in descending order using the `sort` method. This operation directly affects the variable `b`. As `b` is a list of integers obtained from input split, sorting it in reverse order changes the order of elements in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers based on the input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and sorted in reverse order.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers based on the input values, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split and sorted in reverse order**
