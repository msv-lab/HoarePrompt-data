Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values by splitting the input. The input is expected to contain three integers separated by spaces. Since the values are positive integers within the specified ranges, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges**
