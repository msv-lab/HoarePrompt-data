Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than 0 if `m` is greater than 0, `shares` is 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. The loop can execute again if `m` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0 if `m` is greater than 0. If shares > 0, `shares` is 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`.***
