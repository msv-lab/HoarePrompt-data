Example Answer:
`max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value from the list `b`. The previous values of the variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input splitting, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input splitting, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value from the list `b`**
