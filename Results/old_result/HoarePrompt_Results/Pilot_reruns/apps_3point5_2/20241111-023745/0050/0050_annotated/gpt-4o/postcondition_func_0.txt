The function `func` reads three positive integers `n`, `m`, and `r` from input and two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, the remaining amount after buying the maximum shares, and the total amount spent on buying the shares. The function prints the total amount spent. The function does not have return values but operates based on the given constraints and relationships between the input parameters.
