Example Answer:
The variable `data` is assigned the result of `input().split()`, which splits the input based on whitespace. Since the initial state does not provide the specific input values, the output state will be the same as the initial state.
Output State: **Precondition: a and b are non-negative integers with no more than 10^6 digits.**
