Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value of `data[1]` after removing any leading zeros. Since `a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros, the value of `b` will be the same as `data[1]` without leading zeros. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros, `b` is the value of `data[1]` without leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros, `b` is the value of `data[1]` without leading zeros**
