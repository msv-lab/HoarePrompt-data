Postcondition: ***`a` is a non-negative integer with no leading zeros. If `b` is an empty string or evaluates to false, `b` is updated to '0'. If `a` is 0, it remains unchanged as '0'. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` and `b`. After the execution of the if-else block, the program prints '<' if `a` is less than `b`, prints '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and prints '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged based on the given conditions. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if-else block.***
