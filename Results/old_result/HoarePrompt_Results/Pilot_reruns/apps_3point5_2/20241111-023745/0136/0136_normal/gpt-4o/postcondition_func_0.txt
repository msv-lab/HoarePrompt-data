The function `func_1` reads input data, removes leading zeros from two non-negative integers `a` and `b`, then compares their lengths. If `a` is shorter than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is longer than `b`, it prints '>'. If they are equal, it prints '='. The comparison is based on the modified `a` and `b` values. If `a` or `b` are empty strings or evaluate to false, they are set to '0'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
