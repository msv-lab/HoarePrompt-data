Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as input, removes leading zeros from them, and compares their lengths. If `a` is shorter than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is longer than `b`, it prints '>'. If they are equal, it prints '='. The comparison is based on the modified `a` and `b` values. If `a` or `b` are empty strings or evaluate to false, they are set to '0'. The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the provided examples. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the code works as expected. No edge cases are identified where the code does not follow the problem description.
