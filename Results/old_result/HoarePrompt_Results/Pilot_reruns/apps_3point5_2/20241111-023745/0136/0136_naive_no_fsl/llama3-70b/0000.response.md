Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly compares two very long integers a and b, after stripping any leading zeroes. It then prints "<" if a < b, ">" if a > b, and "=" if they are equal, as specified in the problem description. The logic of the program is correct and it handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description.
