Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program accurately follows the problem description. It takes two very long integers 'a' and 'b' as strings, removes any leading zeros, compares them, and prints '<' if 'a' is less than 'b', '>' if 'a' is greater than 'b', and '=' if they are equal. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the state of the program at different points and the possible outcomes based on the comparison of 'a' and 'b'. 

There are no cases identified where the program does not work as expected based on the problem description and all the provided examples. Therefore, the correctness of the program is deemed to be true.
