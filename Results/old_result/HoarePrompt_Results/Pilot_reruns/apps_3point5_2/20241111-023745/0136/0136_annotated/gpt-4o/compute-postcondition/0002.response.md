Example Answer:
The variable `b` is assigned the value of the second element of the list `data` with leading zeros stripped. The value of `a` is the first element of `data` with leading zeros stripped. Therefore, after execution, `b` will be the second element of `data` with leading zeros stripped. 
Output State: **`a` is the first element of `data` with leading zeros stripped, `b` is the second element of `data` with leading zeros stripped**
