Example Answer:
`p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, which already contains the product of 1 to `total_days`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: numerator will contain the product of (total_days - k + 1) to `total_days`, denominator will contain the product of 1 to `total_days`, `MOD` is 1000003, and `p_no_shared` is the same as `numerator`.
Output State: **numerator will contain the product of (total_days - k + 1) to total_days, denominator will contain the product of 1 to total_days, MOD is 1000003, p_no_shared is the same as numerator, p_total is equal to denominator**
