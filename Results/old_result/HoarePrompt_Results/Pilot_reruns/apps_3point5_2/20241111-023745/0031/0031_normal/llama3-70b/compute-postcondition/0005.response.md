Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is multiplied by the value of `total_days`. As `total_days` is a large number based on the value of `n` and `denominator` is initially 1, after execution, `denominator` will be equal to `total_days`. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is a large number based on the value of `n`, `numerator` is calculated based on the values of `total_days` and `i`, `denominator` is now equal to `total_days`, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total_days` is a large number based on the value of `n`, `numerator` is calculated based on the values of `total_days` and `i`, `denominator` is now equal to `total_days`, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
