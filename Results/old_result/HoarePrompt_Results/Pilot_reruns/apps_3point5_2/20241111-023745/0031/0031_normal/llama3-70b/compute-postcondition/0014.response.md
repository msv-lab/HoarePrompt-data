Example Answer:
`gcd` is assigned the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`. The values of `numerator` and `denominator` are calculated based on the initial state provided. If `k` is less than or equal to 0, both `numerator` and `denominator` will be 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `numerator` is the result of the multiplication, `denominator` is the result of the multiplication, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.
Output State: **`numerator` is the result of the multiplication, `denominator` is the result of the multiplication, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`**
