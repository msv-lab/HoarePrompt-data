Example Answer:
`numerator` is multiplied by `total_days - i`, where `total_days` is a large number based on the value of `n`, `i` is 0. The value of `total_days` and `i` are unknown, so the output state is: `total_days` is a large number based on the value of `n`, `numerator` is calculated based on the values of `total_days` and `i`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total_days` is a large number based on the value of `n`, `numerator` is calculated based on the values of `total_days` and `i`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
