Example Answer: 
The value of `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`. If the loop did not execute, `numerator` contains the product of (total_days - k + 1) to total_days, and `denominator` contains the product of 1 to total_days. If k is 0 or less, both `numerator` and `denominator` are 1. Therefore, after execution, the value of `p_no_shared` will be the same as `numerator`. 
Output State: **numerator will contain the product of (total_days - k + 1) to total_days, denominator will contain the product of 1 to total_days, MOD is 1000003. The loop will not execute if k is 0 or less, in which case numerator and denominator will remain 1, p_no_shared is the same as numerator.**
