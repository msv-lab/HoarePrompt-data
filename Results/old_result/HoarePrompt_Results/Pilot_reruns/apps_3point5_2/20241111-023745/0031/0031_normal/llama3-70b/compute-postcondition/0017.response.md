Example Answer:
The function returns the remainder of `numerator` divided by `10 ** 6 + 3` and the remainder of `denominator` divided by `10 ** 6 + 3`. The values of `numerator`, `denominator`, and `gcd` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state is unknown.
Output State: **Unknown**
