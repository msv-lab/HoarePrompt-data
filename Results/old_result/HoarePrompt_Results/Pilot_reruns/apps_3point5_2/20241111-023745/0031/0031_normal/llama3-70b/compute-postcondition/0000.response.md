Example Answer:
`total_days` is assigned the value of `2` raised to the power of `n`. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, the result of `2 ** n` will be a large number. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is a large number based on the value of `n`.
Output State: **`total_days` is a large number based on the value of `n`**
