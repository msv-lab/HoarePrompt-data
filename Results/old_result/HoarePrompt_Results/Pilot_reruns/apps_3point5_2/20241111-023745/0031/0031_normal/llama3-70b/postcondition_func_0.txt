The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. It calculates `total_days` as 2 raised to the power of `n`. Then, it iterates `k` times to update `numerator` and `denominator` accordingly. After that, it calculates the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, divides both by the gcd, and returns the remainders of the divisions when divided by (10^6 + 3) as a tuple. The function does not handle cases where `n` or `k` are outside the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), and it does not account for potential errors during the calculation or other edge cases.
