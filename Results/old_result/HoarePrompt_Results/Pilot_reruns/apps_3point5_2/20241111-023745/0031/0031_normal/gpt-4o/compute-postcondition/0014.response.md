Example Answer:
The `numerator` is updated by multiplying its current value with the result of `(total_days - i) % MOD`. The initial state does not provide the values of `total_days` and `i`, but it is known that `total_days` is greater than `i`. The value of `MOD` is given as 1000003. Therefore, the output state is: MOD is 1000003, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is updated, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is updated, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1**
