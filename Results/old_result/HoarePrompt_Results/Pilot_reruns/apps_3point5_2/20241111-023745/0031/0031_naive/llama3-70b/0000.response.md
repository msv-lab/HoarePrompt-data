Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland. It follows the problem description by calculating the numerator and denominator as mentioned. The program then reduces the fraction to its irreducible form and takes the remainders modulo 10^6 + 3. The usage of gcd function from the math module ensures that the fraction is in its simplest form. The code also correctly takes input and prints the output as required. 

Overall, the program seems to be handling all potential cases and correctly solving the problem as described.
