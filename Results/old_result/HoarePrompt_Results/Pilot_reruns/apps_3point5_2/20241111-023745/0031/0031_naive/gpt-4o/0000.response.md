Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in Udayland. It handles the cases where k is greater than 2^n by outputting 1 1 which is the case where it is guaranteed that two people will share the same birthday. The program also calculates the probability modulo 10^6 + 3 as required. The logic used in the function func_1 to find the greatest common divisor and the calculation of the probability in func_2 is correct and follows the problem description. Overall, the program handles all potential cases and provides the correct output.
