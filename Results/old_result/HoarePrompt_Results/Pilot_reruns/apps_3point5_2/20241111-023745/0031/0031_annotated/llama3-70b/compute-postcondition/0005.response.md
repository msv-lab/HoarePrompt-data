Example Answer:
`denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`, where `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`. The values of `total_days`, `numerator`, `i`, and `k` do not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `2^n`, `denominator` is multiplied by 2^n, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `2^n`, `denominator` is multiplied by 2^n, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
