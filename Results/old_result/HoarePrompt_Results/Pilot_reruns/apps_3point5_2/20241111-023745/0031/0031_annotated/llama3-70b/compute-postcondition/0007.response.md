Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is multiplied by the result of `total_days - i`, where `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n` and `i` is 1. The previous values of the variables are known, so we can calculate the result. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `(2^n - 1)`, `denominator` is multiplied by 2^n, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `(2^n - 1)`, `denominator` is multiplied by 2^n, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
