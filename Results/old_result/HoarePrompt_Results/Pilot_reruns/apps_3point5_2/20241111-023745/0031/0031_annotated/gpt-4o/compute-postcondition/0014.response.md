Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying it with `(total_days - i) % MOD`, where `total_days` is shifted left by `n` bits, `i` is 2. The value of `total_days` is shifted left by `n` bits, and `i` is 2. `MOD` is 1000003. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000003, total_days is shifted left by `n` bits, numerator is updated, denominator is updated, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is shifted left by `n` bits, numerator is updated, denominator is updated, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
