Example Answer:
The `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days` and then taking the modulo with `MOD`. The value of `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n` bits, and the `denominator` is initially 1. Therefore, after the calculation, the `denominator` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n bits, numerator is updated, denominator is updated according to the calculation, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
