Example Answer:
The `denominator` is updated by multiplying its current value with `total_days` and then taking the modulo with `MOD`. The value of `total_days` has been shifted left by `n` bits, and the values of `numerator`, `i`, and `k` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000003, total_days is shifted left by `n` bits, numerator is updated, denominator is updated, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is shifted left by `n` bits, numerator is updated, denominator is updated, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
