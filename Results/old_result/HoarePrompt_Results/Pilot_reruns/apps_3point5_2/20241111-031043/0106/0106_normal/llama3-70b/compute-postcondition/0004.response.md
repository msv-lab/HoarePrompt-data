Example Answer:
The value of `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula provided, where `b` is mapped input integer. The value of `m` is already known and satisfies the given constraint. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers satisfying the given constraints; `a` and `b` are assigned mapped input integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`; `a_block` is calculated; `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers satisfying the given constraints; `a` and `b` are assigned mapped input integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`; `a_block` is calculated; `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula provided**
