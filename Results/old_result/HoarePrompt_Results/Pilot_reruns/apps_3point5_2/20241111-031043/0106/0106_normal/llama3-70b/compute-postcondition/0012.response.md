Functionality: **The function reads input integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It then calculates various values based on these inputs and prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`. The calculated values include `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, `min_block_time`, and `min_floor_time`. The function determines `min_floor_time` based on the relationship between `a_floor` and `b_floor`, ensuring correct calculation. It does not accept any parameters explicitly and focuses on the calculations and print statement.**
