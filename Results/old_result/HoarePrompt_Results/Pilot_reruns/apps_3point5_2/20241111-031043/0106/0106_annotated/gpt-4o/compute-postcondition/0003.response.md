Example Answer:
The function returns two variables `block` and `floor`. Since there is not enough information provided to determine the exact value of `floor`, we cannot provide a specific value for it. Therefore, the output state is unknown for `floor`, but the function returns `block`.
Output State: **Unknown value for `floor`, and the function returns `block`**
