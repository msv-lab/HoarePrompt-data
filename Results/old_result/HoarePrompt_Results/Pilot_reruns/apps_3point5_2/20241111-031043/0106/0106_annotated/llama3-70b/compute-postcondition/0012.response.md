Functionality: **The function `func` reads input integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, performs calculations based on these inputs, and prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`. The calculations involve determining values for `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, `min_block_time`, and `min_floor_time` according to specific formulas. The function assumes preconditions that `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, and `a` and `b` are integers between 1 and `n * m * k`. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
