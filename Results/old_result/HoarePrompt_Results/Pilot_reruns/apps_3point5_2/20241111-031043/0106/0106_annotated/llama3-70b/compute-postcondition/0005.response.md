Example Answer:
`b_block` is assigned the value `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, where `b` is the input integer, `m` and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000. `b_floor` is calculated based on `b` and `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `a_block` is an integer, `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `a_block` is an integer, `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`**
