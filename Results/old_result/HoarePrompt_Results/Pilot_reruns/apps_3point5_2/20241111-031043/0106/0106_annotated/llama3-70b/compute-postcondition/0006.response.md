Example Answer:
`min_block_time` is calculated based on the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block`, or the difference between `n` and the absolute difference. The value of `a_block` and `b_block` are determined by the provided formulas. Other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `a_block` is an integer, `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, and `min_block_time` is calculated as stated.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers between 1 and 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, `a_block` is an integer, `b_floor` is calculated as (b - 1) % m + 1, `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, and `min_block_time` is calculated based on the provided formula**
