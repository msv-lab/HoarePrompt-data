Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly checks if all the remainders are distinct as per the problem description. It uses a set to keep track of all the remainders encountered so far and returns 'No' if a duplicate remainder is found. The loop runs from 1 to k inclusive to check all the remainders. It also handles the case when k is greater than or equal to n. Overall, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and hence is correct.
