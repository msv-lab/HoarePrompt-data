According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`, which means `i` should be less than `k + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k + 1`, so to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n; i is equal to k; remainder is the result of n % (k + 1)**
