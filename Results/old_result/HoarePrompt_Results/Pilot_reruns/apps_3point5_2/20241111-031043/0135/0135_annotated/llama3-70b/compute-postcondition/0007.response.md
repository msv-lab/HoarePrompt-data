Example Answer: 
The value of `remainder` is added to the `seen` set. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k` are integers where `k` is greater than 0, `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`.
Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers where `k` is greater than 0, `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`**
