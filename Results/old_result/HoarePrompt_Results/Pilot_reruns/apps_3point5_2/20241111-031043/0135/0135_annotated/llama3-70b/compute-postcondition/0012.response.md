Postcondition: ***`n`, `k`, `seen` are integers where `k` is greater than 0, `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `k + 1. If the `remainder` is already in `seen`, then 'No' is printed and the program exits. This ensures that duplicate remainders are detected and the program terminates if such a case occurs.***
