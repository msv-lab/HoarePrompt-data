Postcondition: ***`n`, `k` are integers where `k` is greater than 0, `seen` is an empty set, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`. If the remainder of `n` divided by `i` is present in the set `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, there is no further change to the variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, and `remainder`.***
