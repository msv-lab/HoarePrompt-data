Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of n % i, where i = k + 1. The initial values of n, k, and i are given such that n and k are integers between 1 and 10^18, k is less than n, and i = k + 1. Therefore, the output state is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n; i is equal to k + 1; remainder is the result of n % (k + 1).
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is less than n; i is equal to k + 1; remainder is the result of n % (k + 1)**
