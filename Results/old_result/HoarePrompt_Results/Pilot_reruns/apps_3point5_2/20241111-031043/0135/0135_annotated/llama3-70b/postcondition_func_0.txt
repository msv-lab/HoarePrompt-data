The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from input. It then iterates from 1 to `k`, calculating the remainder of dividing `n` by each `i`. If a remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits. If no remainders are repeated, it prints 'Yes'. The function does not explicitly return a value.
