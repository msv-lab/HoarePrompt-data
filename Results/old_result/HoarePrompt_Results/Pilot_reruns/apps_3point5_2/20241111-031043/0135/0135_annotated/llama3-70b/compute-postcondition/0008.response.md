According to the code, the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k` are integers where `k` is greater than 0, `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`, and `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to the next value after the last iteration. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n`, `k` are integers where `k` is greater than 0, `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `k + 1`**
