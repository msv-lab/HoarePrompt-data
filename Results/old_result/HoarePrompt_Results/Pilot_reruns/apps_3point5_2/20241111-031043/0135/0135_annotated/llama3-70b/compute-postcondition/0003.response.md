Example Answer:
`remainder` is calculated as the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`, but the value of `i` is not given. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is assigned an integer value from input, `k` is assigned an integer value from input and `k` is greater than 0, `seen` is an empty set, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`.
Output State: **`n` is assigned an integer value from input, `k` is assigned an integer value from input and `k` is greater than 0, `seen` is an empty set, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`**
