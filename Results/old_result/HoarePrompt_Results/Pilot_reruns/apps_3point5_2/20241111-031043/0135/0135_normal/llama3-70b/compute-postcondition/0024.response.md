Functionality: **The function `func` reads two integers `n` and `k` from input and calculates the remainder of `n` divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any remainder repeats, it prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it prints 'Yes'. The function handles cases where `k` is less than 1 by not executing the loop. The functionality does not return any value.**
