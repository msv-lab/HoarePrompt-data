Output State: **If `k` is greater than 0 and `n` is a positive integer, the loop will execute at least once. After the loop executes, `seen_remainders` will contain unique remainders of `n` divided by `i` for each `i` in the range [1, k]. If at any point a calculated remainder is already in `seen_remainders`, the loop will return 'No' and terminate. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.**
