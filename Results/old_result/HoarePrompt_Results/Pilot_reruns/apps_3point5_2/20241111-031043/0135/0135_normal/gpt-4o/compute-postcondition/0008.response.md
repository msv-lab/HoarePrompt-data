Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, where `i` is 2. The initial state states that `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, and `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the calculated remainder.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the calculated remainder**
