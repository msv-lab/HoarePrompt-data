Output State: **If `k` is less than 1, the loop won't execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 to 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the values of remainders calculated in the loop, `i` is equal to `k`, and `remainder` is the result of `n % k`. If any `remainder` value is already in the set `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits.**
