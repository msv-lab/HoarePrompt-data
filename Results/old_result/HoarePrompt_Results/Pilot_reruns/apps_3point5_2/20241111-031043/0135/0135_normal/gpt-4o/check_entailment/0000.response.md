Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code accurately captures the problem description by checking if all remainders of n divided by i for 1 ≤ i ≤ k are distinct.
- If k is greater than or equal to n, the code correctly returns 'No' as per the problem requirements.
- The code uses a set to keep track of seen remainders and returns 'No' if a duplicate remainder is encountered.
- The loop iterates through the range [1, k] and calculates unique remainders, ensuring that all remainders are distinct.
- The function returns 'Yes' if the loop completes successfully without any duplicate remainders.
- The output hints align with the code logic and confirm that the code works as intended.
