According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the `votes` string to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 1 character, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists. If the first character of `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains only the value 0, else `r_queue` contains only the value 0. In all cases, `i` is 0 and `v` is the first character of `votes`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `votes` string should have at least 2 characters remaining after the previous iteration, and `i` should be incremented to 1 in the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 2 characters remaining, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of `votes`.**
