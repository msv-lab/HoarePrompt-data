Postcondition: ***If both d_queue and r_queue are not empty, the loop will iterate through the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters in votes. After each iteration, if d_index is less than r_index, d_queue will be updated with the addition of d_index + n, and r_queue will remain the same. If d_index is not less than r_index, d_queue will be empty, and r_queue will be updated with the addition of r_index + n. The loop will end when either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty. In the if part, 'D' will be printed if d_queue is not empty. In the else part, 'R' will be printed if d_queue is empty. No variables are updated or changed in either part.***
