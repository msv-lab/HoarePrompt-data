Example Answer:
`i` is appended to the `r_queue` list. Since `r_queue` was initially empty, after execution, `r_queue` will contain the value `1`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 2 characters remaining, `d_queue` is a list, `r_queue` contains the value `1`, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of `votes`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 2 characters remaining, `d_queue` is a list, `r_queue` contains the value `1`, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of `votes`**
