Postcondition: ***`d_index`, `r_index`, `d_queue`, `r_queue`, `n` are integers. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_index` is updated with the popped value, `d_queue` is one element shorter, and a new value `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, then `d_index` is updated with the popped value, `d_queue` is one element shorter, and `r_queue` appends `r_index + n`. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios of the if-else block.***
