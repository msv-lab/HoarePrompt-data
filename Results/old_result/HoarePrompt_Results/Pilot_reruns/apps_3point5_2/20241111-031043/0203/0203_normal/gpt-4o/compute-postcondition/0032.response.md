Example Answer: 
The value `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`, making `d_queue` one element longer. The previous values of `d_index` and `d_queue` are not provided, so the output state is: `d_index` is updated with the popped value, `d_queue` is one element shorter, and a new value is appended to `d_queue`.
Output State: **`d_index` is updated with the popped value, `d_queue` is one element shorter, a new value is appended to `d_queue`**
