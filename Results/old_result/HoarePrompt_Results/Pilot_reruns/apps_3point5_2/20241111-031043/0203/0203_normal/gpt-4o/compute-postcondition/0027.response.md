Example Answer:
`r_index` and `n` are added together and appended to `r_queue`. The value of `r_index` and `n` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` is now empty, `r_queue` is one element longer, `d_index` holds the value that was popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` holds the value that was popped from the front of `r_queue`.
Output State: **`d_queue` is now empty, `r_queue` is one element longer, `d_index` holds the value that was popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` holds the value that was popped from the front of `r_queue`**
