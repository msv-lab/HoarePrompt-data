According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `fractions` list. If the list has at least 2 fractions, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, the input string contains `n` characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R', and `fraction` can be either 'D' or 'R'. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `fractions` list must have at least 2 fractions.
State: **`n` is an input integer, the input string contains `n` characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R'. If `fraction` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1, `remocrats` remains 0, and `fractions` list has at least 2 fractions. If `fraction` is 'R', then `depublicans` remains 0, `remocrats` is increased by 1, and `fractions` list has at least 2 fractions.**
