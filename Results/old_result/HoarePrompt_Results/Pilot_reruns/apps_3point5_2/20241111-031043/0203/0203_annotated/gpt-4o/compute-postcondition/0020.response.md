Example Answer:
The value `d_index + n` is appended to the `d_queue`. The previous values of variables are not known, so the output state is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the non-empty input string representing the votes, `r_index` contains the popped element from `r_queue`, and `d_queue` contains the appended value of `d_index + n`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a non-empty string, `r_index` is a popped element from `r_queue`, `d_queue` contains the appended value of `d_index + n`**
