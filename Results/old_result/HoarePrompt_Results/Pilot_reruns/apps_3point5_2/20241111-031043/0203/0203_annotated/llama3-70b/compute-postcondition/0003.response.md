Example Answer:
`remocrats` is assigned the value 0. The value of `remocrats` is now 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, fractions is a string input, depublicans is 0, remocrats is 0.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, fractions is a string input, depublicans is 0, remocrats is 0**
