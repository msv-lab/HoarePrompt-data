Example Answer:
`r_index` is assigned the popped element from the front of `r_queue`. The state of `r_queue` changes as the first element is removed. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` contains a non-empty input string, `r_index` contains the popped element from `r_queue`, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`, and the final state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` depends on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index` after the execution of the if-else block.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` contains a non-empty input string, `r_index` contains the popped element from `r_queue`, `d_index` is the popped element from `d_queue`, and the final state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` depends on the comparison of `d_index` and `r_index` after the execution of the if-else block.**
