The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the input and a string `fractions`. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' characters in the `fractions` string, incrementing `depublicans` for 'D' and `remocrats` for 'R'. After that, it compares the counts of `depublicans` and `remocrats`. If `depublicans` are greater than `remocrats`, it prints 'D', otherwise it prints 'R'. The function does not handle cases where `n` is not within the specified range (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) or if the `fractions` string contains characters other than 'D' or 'R'.
