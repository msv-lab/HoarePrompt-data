Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, `votes` contains the non-empty input string representing the votes. If the next character in `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains 1 and `r_queue` is updated accordingly. If the next character in `votes` is not 'D', `r_queue` contains 1 and `d_queue` is updated accordingly. In both cases, `i` is 1 and `v` is the next character in the `votes` string.***
