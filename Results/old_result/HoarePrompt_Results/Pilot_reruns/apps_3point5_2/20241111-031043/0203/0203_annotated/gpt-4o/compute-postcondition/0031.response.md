Example Answer:
The code pops the first element from the `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. Since `r_queue` was not empty, the first element is popped and stored in `r_index`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` contains a non-empty input string, `r_index` contains the popped element from `r_queue`, `d_index` contains the popped element from `d_queue`, `d_queue` is now empty, `r_queue` is now empty except the popped element.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` contains a non-empty input string, `r_index` contains the popped element from `r_queue`, `d_index` contains the popped element from `d_queue`, `d_queue` is now empty, `r_queue` is now empty except the popped element**
