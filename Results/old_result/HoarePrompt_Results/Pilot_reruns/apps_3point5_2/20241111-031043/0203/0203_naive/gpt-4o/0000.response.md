Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input where the first line represents the number of employees and the second line represents the fractions of the employees.
- It then simulates the voting process by maintaining queues for each fraction and popping the indices of employees who make a statement.
- The program correctly handles the case where an employee denies another employee to vote and updates the queue accordingly.
- The voting process continues until there is only one fraction left with eligible voters, and the program correctly outputs the winning fraction.
- The logic of the code aligns with the problem description and covers all possible scenarios of the voting process.
