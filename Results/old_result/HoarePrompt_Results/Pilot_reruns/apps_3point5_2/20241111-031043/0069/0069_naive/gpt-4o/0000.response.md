Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input for each test case.
- It calculates the balance of the string $s$ correctly.
- It then calculates the prefix balances for all possible prefixes of the string $s$.
- It handles the case where the balance is 0 and checks if there is an infinite number of prefixes.
- It calculates the count of prefixes with the desired balance $x$ correctly.
- The program outputs the correct number of prefixes for each test case. 

Therefore, based on the provided problem description and the logic implemented in the code, it seems to be correct for all potential cases.
