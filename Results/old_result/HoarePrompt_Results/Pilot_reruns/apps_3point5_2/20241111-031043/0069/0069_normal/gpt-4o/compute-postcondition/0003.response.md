Example Answer:
The variable `index` is assigned the value `1`. The other variables `data` (list of strings) and `T` (integer value) remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` is a list of strings based on the input provided, `T` is an integer value based on the input provided, `index` is 1.
Output State: **`data` is a list of strings based on the input provided, `T` is an integer value based on the input provided, `index` is 1**
