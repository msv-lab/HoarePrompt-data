Postcondition: ***If the length of string `s` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `prefix_balances` has updated values based on the calculations in the loop, `x` is an integer value from the list `data` at index 3, `index` is 2, `balance` is the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in the string `s`, `i` is equal to `n + 1`. If `balance` is equal to 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then -1 is appended to the `results` list. If `balance` is equal to 0, and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then 0 is appended to the `results` list. If `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is the number of times the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied when iterating through `prefix_balances`. The `results` list contains the counts of such occurrences.***
