Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `n` is an integer. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, 0 is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, the loop calculates the prefix balances based on `s`, incrementing by 1 for character '0' and decrementing by 1 for character '1'. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros. If `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least one zero value, `count` is incremented based on the conditions specified in the loop, and the value of `count` is appended to the `results` list.***
