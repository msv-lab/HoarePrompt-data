Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer greater than 0, prefix_balances is a list with at least 3 non-zero values, x is an integer value from the list data at index 3, index is 5, balance is calculated based on the string s, i is equal to n + 1, T is greater than 1, count is an integer. If (x - b) is divisible by balance and the division of (x - b) by balance is greater than or equal to 0, then count is increased by 1.***
