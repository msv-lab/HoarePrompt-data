Postcondition: ***If the string `s` has a length less than or equal to 1, the loop will not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `prefix_balances` is a list with updated values based on the calculation in the code snippet, `x` is an integer value from the list `data` at index 3, `index` is 2, `balance` is the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in the string `s`, and `i` is equal to `n + 1. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then -1 is appended to the `results` list. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then 0 is appended to the `results` list.***
