Postcondition: ***`T-1` is a positive integer greater than 1, `n` and `x` are integers from user input, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`, `n` and `x` are assigned values from user input, `balance` is assigned the value of `cnt0 - cnt1`. In the if-else block, if `balance` is equal to `x`, the program prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the program prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, covering all possible scenarios involving the input values and their relationships within the if-else block.***
