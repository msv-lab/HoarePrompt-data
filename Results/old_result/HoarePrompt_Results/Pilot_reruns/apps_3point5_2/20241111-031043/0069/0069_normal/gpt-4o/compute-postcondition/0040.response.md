Example Answer: 
The value of `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` from the list `data`. The value of `index` is not provided, so we cannot determine the exact value of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least one zero value, `x` is an integer value from the list `data` at index `index + 1`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with at least one zero value, `x` is an integer value from the list `data` at index `index + 1`**
