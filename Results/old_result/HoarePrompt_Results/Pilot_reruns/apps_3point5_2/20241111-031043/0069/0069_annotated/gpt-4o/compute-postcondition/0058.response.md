Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums based on the binary string `s` with length `n + 1` with at least 1 element, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, `x` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is increased by 1.***
