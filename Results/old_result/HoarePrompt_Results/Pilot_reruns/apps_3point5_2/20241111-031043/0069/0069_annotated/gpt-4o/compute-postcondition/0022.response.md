Postcondition: ***The loop calculates the prefix sum of balances based on the binary string `s`, where each element in `prefix_balances` is the sum of the corresponding elements in `s` up to that point. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros with length 1. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then `results` contains -1. Otherwise, `results` is a list containing 0.***
