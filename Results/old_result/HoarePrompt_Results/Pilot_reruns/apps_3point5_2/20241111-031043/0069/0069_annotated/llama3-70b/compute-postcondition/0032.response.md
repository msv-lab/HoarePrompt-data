Output State: **The loop takes input values T, n, x, and s, where T is a positive integer, n is a positive integer within the range [1, 10^5], x is an integer within the range [-10^9, 10^9], and s is a binary string of length n. For each iteration, the loop reads n and x from input, calculates the count of '0's and '1's in the string s, computes the balance as cnt0 - cnt1. If balance equals x, it prints n + 1. If (x - balance) is divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of (x - balance) divided by (cnt0 - cnt1) plus 1. This loop will execute T times, handling different scenarios based on the input values.**
