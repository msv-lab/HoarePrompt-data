Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` is converted to an integer. The previous values of `prefix_balances`, `balance`, `count`, `x`, and `T` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums based on the binary string `s` with length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0, `n` is the newly assigned integer value, `x` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `T` is greater than 1.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of prefix sums based on the binary string `s` with length `n + 1`, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0, `n` is the newly assigned integer value, `x` is an integer obtained from `data[1]`, `T` is greater than 1**
