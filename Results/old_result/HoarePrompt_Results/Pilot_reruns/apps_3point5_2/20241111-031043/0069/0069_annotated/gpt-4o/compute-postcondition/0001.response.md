Example Answer:
The `input().split()` function splits the input data into a list of strings. Since the initial state mentions that `T` is a positive integer, `T` can be extracted as the first element of the list. The other variables `n`, `x`, and `s` can be extracted as the second, third, and fourth elements of the list respectively. 
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`**
