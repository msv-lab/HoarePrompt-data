Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of variables m needed to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the input sequence a, then iterates through it to check if each element is equal to 2 times the previous element. If not, it increments the variable m. The program then outputs m if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it outputs -1. The logic seems correct, and the program should work as expected for all potential cases.
