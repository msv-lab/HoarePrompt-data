Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If there exists an element `a[i] - x` in the list `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True, `m` remains 0, `assigned` is still a list with at least 1 element, and `x` is the third element in the list `assigned`. The overall state after the if statement is that `can_form` is True, `m` is 0, `assigned` still contains at least 1 element, and `x` remains the third element in `assigned`. If the condition is not met, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
