Functionality: ** The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` and a list of `n` integers. It then sorts the list in ascending order and checks for pairs of consecutive elements where the second element is not twice the first element. For each mismatch, it increments a counter `m`. Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. The functionality of the function is to determine the number of mismatches in the sorted list `a` and print the count, unless it exceeds 23, in which case it prints -1. **
