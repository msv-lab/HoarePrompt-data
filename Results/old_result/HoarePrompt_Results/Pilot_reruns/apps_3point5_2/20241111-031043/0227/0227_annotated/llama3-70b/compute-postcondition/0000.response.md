Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the input is a positive integer within the specified range, the output state is: n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23).
Output State: **n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23)**
