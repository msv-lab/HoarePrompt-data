Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True, `m` is 0, the smallest positive integer in list `a` is in the assigned set, and the condition `a[i] - x` is in the assigned set still holds. If `a[i] - x` is in the assigned set, then `can_form` remains True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
