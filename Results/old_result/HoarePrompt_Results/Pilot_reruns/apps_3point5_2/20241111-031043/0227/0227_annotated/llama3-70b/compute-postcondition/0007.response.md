According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`, so `i` should be adjusted to 2. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`a` is sorted in ascending order, `m` is increased by 1 if `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]` multiplied by 2. In all other cases, `m` remains 1. `n` is greater than 1, and `i` is 2**
