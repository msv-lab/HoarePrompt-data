Example Answer:
The input is split, converted to integers, and stored in list `a`. The value of `n` is a positive integer, so `a` contains `n` elements. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` integers**
