Output State: **`can_form` is a boolean variable that is set to True if there exists an element `a[i] - x` in the list `assigned`. The variable `m` remains 0, `assigned` is still a list with at least 1 element, and `x` is the last element in the list `assigned`. If the list `assigned` is empty or the condition is never met, `can_form` remains False, `m` is 0, `assigned` is still a list with at least 1 element, and `x` is the last element in the list `assigned`.**
