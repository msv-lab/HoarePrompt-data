According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the upper bound for the range of the loop. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than `n+1` to satisfy the loop condition. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`can_form` is True if there exists an element `a[i] - x` in the list `assigned`, `m` is incremented by 1 if `can_form` was False, `assigned` is a list with at least 2 elements with the last element being `x`, `i` is less than `n+1`**
