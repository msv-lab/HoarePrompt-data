The function reads a positive integer n followed by n distinct positive integers and sorts them in ascending order. It then calculates the number of times an element in the list is not twice the value of the previous element. If n is greater than 1, it prints the count of such occurrences if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1.
