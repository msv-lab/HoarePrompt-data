According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is 4, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3. If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]` multiplied by 2, then `m` is increased by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 because the loop starts at 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`m` is 4, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 4**
