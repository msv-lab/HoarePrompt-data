Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains elements left to iterate over with at least 1 element, `m` is incremented by 1, `i` is increased by 1. If `a[i] - x` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True and the loop is terminated.***
