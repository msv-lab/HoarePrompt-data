Example Answer:
min_lemon is assigned the minimum value among a, b//2, and c//4. The values of a, b, and c are input integers. Therefore, min_lemon will be the smallest integer among a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4. 
Output State: **a is an input integer, b is an input integer, c is an input integer, min_lemon is the smallest among a, b//2, and c//4**
