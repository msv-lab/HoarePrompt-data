Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes in the number of lemons, apples, and pears Nikolay has, then calculates the maximum number of lemons based on the minimum of `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, which correctly follows the problem description of the ratio 1:2:4 for lemons, apples, and pears.
- It then calculates the total number of fruits by multiplying the max lemons by 1, 2, and 4 respectively, which is in line with the compote recipe requirements.
- The code outputs the total number of fruits correctly, considering the scenario where Nikolay might not have enough of each fruit to make a compote, as shown in the examples provided in the problem description.
