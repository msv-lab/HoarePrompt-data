Output State: 
If `s` is not empty and contains at least one character from the `alphabet`, `res` will contain the characters added in each iteration until no characters from the `alphabet` are found in `s`. After the loop finishes, `s` will not contain any characters from the `alphabet` due to the replacements made. If `s` is an empty string or none of its characters are in the `alphabet`, the loop will not execute, and `res` will remain an empty string.
If `s` is empty or does not contain any characters from the `alphabet`, `res` will be an empty string, and `s` will remain unchanged.
