According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of string `target`, which is 26. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been increased by 1, and `j` is determined based on the comparison between `s[i]` and `target[j]`. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `len(s) - 1` and `j` needs to be less than `target_len`.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 2, `j` is either 0 or 1 if `s[i+1]` is equal to `target[j]`**
