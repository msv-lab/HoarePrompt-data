Example Answer:
The character `char` is replaced with the character that is one position to the right in the alphabet. The `char` variable is changed, and `s` is updated with the new character. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the character replaced, `char` is in the new `s`, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the character replaced, `char` is in the new `s`, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is a string with the added character**
