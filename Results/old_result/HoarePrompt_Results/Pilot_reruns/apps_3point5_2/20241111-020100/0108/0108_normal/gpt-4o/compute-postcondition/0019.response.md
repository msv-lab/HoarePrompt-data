Postcondition: ***If `s` contains all the characters in `target` in the same order, then after the execution of the if-else block, `i` will be equal to the length of `s` and `j` will be set to 26. If `s` does not contain all the characters in `target` in the same order, then `i` will be equal to the length of `s` and `j` will be the number of characters in `s` that match `target`. In both cases, the program will either print the `target` string or -1 based on the condition.***
