According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again until `char` is no longer in `s`. If `char` is not in `s` initially, the loop will not execute.

At the end of the last iteration, if `char` is in `s`, then `res` will contain all the characters added in each iteration until `char` is no longer in `s`, and `s` will no longer contain `char` after the loop finishes.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to still be in `s` and `s` needs to still contain characters other than `char`. Additionally, `res` should contain all the characters added in each iteration including the previous one.

State: **If `char` is in `s`, `res` contains all characters added in each iteration, `s` still contains characters other than `char`**
