Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the provided code and the problem description, it is evident that the code correctly implements the problem description. The code takes an input string `s` consisting of small English letters and iterates through it to check if it can form the English alphabet as a subsequence. If it can, the code prints the English alphabet; otherwise, it prints -1. The code follows the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, and the annotations also accurately describe the behavior of the code. Therefore, the code is correct.
