Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The previous values of `res`, `char`, and `alphabet` are not specified. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid list of characters.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid list of characters**
