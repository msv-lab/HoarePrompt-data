Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the `res` variable, which accumulates characters. The `s` variable has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet. The `alphabet` variable should have at least one more character. The state of variables `s`, `res`, and `alphabet` are affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` has accumulated characters with the replaced character, `alphabet` has at least one more character**
