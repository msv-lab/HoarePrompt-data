Output State: **If `s` contains `char`, `res` will accumulate characters with the replaced character, `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet. If `s` does not contain `char`, `res` will be empty. After the loop, `alphabet` will have at least one more character. If `s` contains multiple occurrences of `char`, the loop will only replace the first occurrence in each iteration. If `s` does not have any characters matching `char`, the loop will not execute and `res` will remain empty. After the loop, `alphabet` will have characters incremented in alphabetical order.**
