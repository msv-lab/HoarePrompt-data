Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced by the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The replacement is done only once. The previous values of the variables are `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the added character, and `alphabet` is a valid list of characters. After execution, the new value of `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character that comes after it in the alphabet. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid list of characters.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid list of characters**
