According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `len(s)`, and `target_len`. If `i` is less than `len(s)` and `j` is less than `target_len`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1 and `j` is either increased by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, or remains the same. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be less than `len(s)` and `j` should be less than `target_len`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, `j` is increased by 1**
