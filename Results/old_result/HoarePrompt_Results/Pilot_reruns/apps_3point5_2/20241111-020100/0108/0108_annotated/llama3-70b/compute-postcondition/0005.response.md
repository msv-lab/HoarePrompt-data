Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. The value of `char` is not given, so we cannot determine the exact resulting string. However, the length of the string remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid list of characters.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid list of characters**
