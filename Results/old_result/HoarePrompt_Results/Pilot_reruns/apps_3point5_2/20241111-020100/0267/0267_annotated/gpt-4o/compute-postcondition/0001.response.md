According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range from `l` to `r+1` is not empty. This means that `r` should be greater than or equal to `l`. In order for the loop to execute, `l` should be less than or equal to `r`, and `num` should start at `l` in the first iteration. 
State: **`total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
