Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding the current value of `num` and taking the modulo `MOD`. The updated value of `total_sum` depends on the previous value of `total_sum`, the current value of `num`, and the value of `MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_sum` is updated according to the formula (total_sum + num) % MOD, `num` is the next integer after the current `num` and is still less than or equal to `r`, `l` is an integer less than or equal to `r`.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated according to the formula (total_sum + num) % MOD, `num` is the next integer after the current `num` and is still less than or equal to `r`, `l` is an integer less than or equal to `r`**
