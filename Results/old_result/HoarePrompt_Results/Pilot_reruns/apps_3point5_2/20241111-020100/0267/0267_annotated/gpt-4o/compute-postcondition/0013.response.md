The function `func_2` accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10. The function initializes an integer `total_sum` to 0. It then iterates over the range from `l` to `r` inclusive. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true for a given `num`, then `total_sum` is updated to the sum of `total_sum` and `num` after applying the modulo operation with MOD. If the loop does not execute due to `l` being greater than `r`, or if `func_1(num, k)` is always false for all `num` in the range, then `total_sum` remains 0. The function returns the final value of `total_sum`.
Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, and returns the sum of numbers within the range [l, r] for which `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, after applying the modulo operation with MOD. If the loop does not execute or `func_1(num, k)` is always false, it returns 0.**
