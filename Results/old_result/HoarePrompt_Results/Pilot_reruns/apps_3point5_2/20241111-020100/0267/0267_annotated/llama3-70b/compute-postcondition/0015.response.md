Example Answer:
If k is 0, the function returns 0. If the key (n, k) exists in dp, the function returns the stored value. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is updated according to the given formula `dp[n, k] %= MOD` after the loop executes. The value of dp[n, k] is updated by taking its modulus with MOD.  
Output State: **If k is 0, the function returns 0. If the key (n, k) exists in dp, the function returns the stored value. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is updated by taking its modulus with MOD.**
