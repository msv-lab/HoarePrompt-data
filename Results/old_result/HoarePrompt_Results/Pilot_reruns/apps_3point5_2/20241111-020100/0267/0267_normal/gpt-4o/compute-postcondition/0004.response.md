According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is updated based on the evaluation of `func_1(num, k)` and other conditions. The variables `l` and `r` remain unchanged, and `num` is equal to `l`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `num` needs to be incremented by 1.

State: **`total_sum` is an integer. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l) % MOD`, where `l` is a valid starting point and `num` equals `l`. Otherwise, `total_sum` remains unchanged. The variables `l` and `r` maintain their initial values, and `num` is incremented by 1.**
