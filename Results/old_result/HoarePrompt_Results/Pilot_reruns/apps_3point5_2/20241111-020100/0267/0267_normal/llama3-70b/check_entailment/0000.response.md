Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The `func_1` function calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. It initializes an empty dictionary `dp` to store computed values. The function then computes the result of `(count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD` and returns it. The `count` function is responsible for handling specific cases based on the parameters provided.
- The `count` function correctly handles the cases where `k` is 0, looks up values in the dictionary `dp`, and calculates values based on certain conditions. It efficiently computes the sum of numbers meeting the criteria described in the problem statement. 
- The code seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem description. The logic implemented in the functions aligns with the requirements specified, and there are no evident edge cases that are left unhandled. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, the program appears to be correct.
