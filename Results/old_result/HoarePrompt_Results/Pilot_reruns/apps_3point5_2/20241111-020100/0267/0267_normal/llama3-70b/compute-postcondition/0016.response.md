Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values. If k equals 0, the function returns 0. If the key (n, k) is present in dp, the function returns the value stored at that key. If n < 10 ** k, dp[n, k] is set to n. If n is greater than or equal to 10 ** k, dp[n, k] is calculated using the given formula. If k is 1 or less, dp[n, k] remains unchanged. If k is greater than 1, dp[n, k] is updated based on the formula for each value of i from 1 to k-1. The final result is stored in dp[n, k] after applying the modulo operation.***
