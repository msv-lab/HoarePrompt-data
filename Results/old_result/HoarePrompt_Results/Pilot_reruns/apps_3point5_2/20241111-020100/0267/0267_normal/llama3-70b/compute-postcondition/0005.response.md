Example Answer:
The value 9 is assigned to the key (n, k) in the dictionary dp. This operation does not affect the values of n or k. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values with dp[n, k] = 9.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values with dp[n, k] = 9**
