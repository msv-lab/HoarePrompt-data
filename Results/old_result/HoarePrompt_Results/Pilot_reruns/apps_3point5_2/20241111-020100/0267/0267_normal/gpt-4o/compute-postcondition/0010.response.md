According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `num`, `l`, `r` are all integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to True, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. In all cases, `num` is incremented by 1, and `l` and `r` maintain their initial values.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `num` needs to be incremented by 1
- If `func_1(num+1, k)` evaluates to True, then `total_sum` needs to be updated to `(total_sum + num + 1) % MOD`
- No adjustment needed for `l` and `r`

State: **`total_sum`, `num+1`, `l`, `r` where `func_1(num+1, k)` evaluates to True**
