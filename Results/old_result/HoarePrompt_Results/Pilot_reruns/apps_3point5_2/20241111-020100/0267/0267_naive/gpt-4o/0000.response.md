Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines two functions, `func_1` which checks if a number contains at most `k` different digits, and `func_2` which calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` that satisfy the conditions specified in the problem description. The program iterates through all numbers from `l` to `r`, checks if each number satisfies the condition using `func_1`, and accumulates the sum modulo `998244353`. 
The logic of the program is correct and it follows the problem description for every potential case. The program handles the input constraints and correctly calculates the sum of numbers with at most `k` different digits in the specified range.
