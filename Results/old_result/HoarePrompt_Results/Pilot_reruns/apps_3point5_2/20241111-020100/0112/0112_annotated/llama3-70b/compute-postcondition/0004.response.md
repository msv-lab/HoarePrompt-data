Example Answer: 
The code updates the set `digits` with the string representation of each `digit` in the `cube` list. Since `cube` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input, the `digits` set will now contain the individual digits as strings. The initial state shows `cubes` as a list of lists containing integers obtained from input, `n` greater than 0, and `digits` as an empty set. After executing the code, the `digits` set will contain the individual digits as strings from the `cubes` list.
Output State: **`cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input, `n` is greater than 0, `digits` is a set containing individual digits as strings**
