Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` representing the number of cubes Masha received for her birthday. Then, it reads `n` lists of integers representing cubes. It extracts unique digits from all the cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, and converts them into an integer `max_num`. Finally, it prints `max_num`. If the input `n` is 0 or negative, the function will not perform any operations.**
