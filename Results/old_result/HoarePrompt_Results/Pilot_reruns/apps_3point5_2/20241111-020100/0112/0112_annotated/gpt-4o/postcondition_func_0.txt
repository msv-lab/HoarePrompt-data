The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: an integer `n` (where 1 <= n <= 3) and a list of n lists `cubes`, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of a cube (0 <= a_{i}_{j} <= 9). It then iterates through a while loop incrementing x until the function `can_form_number(x + 1)` returns true. The function returns the final value of x, which is either 0 or 1 depending on the function's behavior. The functionality does not fully align with the annotations as there may be cases where `can_form_number(x + 1)` never returns true, leading to x being 0, and this scenario is not explicitly covered in the annotations.
