According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 inner list, the loop can execute. Since the number of inner lists is determined by the input integer `n`, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `digits` is an empty set, so no adjustment is needed for this variable.

State: **`cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input, with the number of inner lists equal to the input integer `n`, `n` is greater than 0, `digits` is an empty set**
