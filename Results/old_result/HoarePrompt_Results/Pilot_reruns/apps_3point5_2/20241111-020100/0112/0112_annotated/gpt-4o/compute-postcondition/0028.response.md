Output State: **If `num` is a positive integer greater than 0 and there is at least 1 digit in `digits`, the loop searches for each digit in the `cube_faces` of each cube. If a digit is found in a cube face that has not been used before, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to `True`, and `found` is set to `True`. The loop continues this process for each cube until all digits have been found or all cubes have been checked. If a digit is not found in any cube, `found` remains `False`. If `num` is 0 or `digits` is an empty list, the loop does not execute. After the loop, the state of the program is determined by whether all digits were found or not. If all digits were found, the loop exits successfully, but if any digit was not found, the loop returns `False`.**
