According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `digits`. If there are more digits left to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`found` is False, there are more digits left in `digits` to iterate over**
