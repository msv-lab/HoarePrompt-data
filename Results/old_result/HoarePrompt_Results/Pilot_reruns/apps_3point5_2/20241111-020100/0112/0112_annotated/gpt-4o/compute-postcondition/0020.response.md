Output State: **If `num` is a positive integer greater than 0 and there is at least 1 digit in `digits`, the loop will search for the first digit in the `cube_faces` of each cube. If the digit is found in a cube face that has not been used before, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` will be set to `True`, and `found` will be set to `True`. The loop will continue this process for each cube until the digit is found or all cubes have been checked. If the digit is not found in any cube, `found` will remain `False`. If `num` is 0 or `digits` is an empty list, the loop will not execute.**
