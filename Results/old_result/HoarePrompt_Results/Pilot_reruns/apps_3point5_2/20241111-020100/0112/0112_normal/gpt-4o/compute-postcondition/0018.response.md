Postcondition: ***`num` is a positive integer with at least one digit, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of `num` as strings, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the i-th element is True if the condition is met and False otherwise, `found` is True if the condition is met and False otherwise, `i` is 2. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and the current digit is in the faces of the cube at index i, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and a break statement is executed.***
