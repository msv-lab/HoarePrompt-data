Example Answer:
All elements in the list `used_cubes` are set to `False` and the length of the list is `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, the list `used_cubes` will contain `n` number of `False` values. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of `num` as strings, `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values.
Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of `num` as strings, `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values**
