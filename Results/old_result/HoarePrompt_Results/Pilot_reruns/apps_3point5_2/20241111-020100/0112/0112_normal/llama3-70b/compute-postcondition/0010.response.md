Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` contains 1 to 3 sublists with integers obtained from input, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers in the sublists of cubes** 

If `n` is less than 1, the loop won't execute, and `digits` will remain an empty set. If `n` is greater than 3, the loop will execute for the first 3 sublists in `cubes`, and `digits` will contain the string representations of integers in those sublists.
