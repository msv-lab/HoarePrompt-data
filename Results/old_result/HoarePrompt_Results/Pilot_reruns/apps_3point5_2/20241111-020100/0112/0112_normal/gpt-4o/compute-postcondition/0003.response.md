Example Answer:
The variable `found` is initialized as `False`. Since the code snippet provided does not alter any other variables or data structures, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`num` is a positive integer with at least one digit, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube, `digits` is a list containing the individual digits of `num` as strings, `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values, `found` is False**
