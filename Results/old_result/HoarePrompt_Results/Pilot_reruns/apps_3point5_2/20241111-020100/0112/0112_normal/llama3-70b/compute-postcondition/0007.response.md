According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `cubes`. If `cubes` contains at least 4 sublists, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` contains 2 to 3 sublists with integers obtained from input, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers in the first sublist of cubes along with the new string representations. So for the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must contain at least 4 sublists.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` contains at least 4 sublists with integers obtained from input, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of integers in the first sublist of cubes along with the new string representations**
