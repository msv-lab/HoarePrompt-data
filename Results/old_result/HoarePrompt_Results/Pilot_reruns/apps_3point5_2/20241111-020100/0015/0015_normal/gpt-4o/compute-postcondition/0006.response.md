Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If c is equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, ensuring the program behaves correctly for each case.***
