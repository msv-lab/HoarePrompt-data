Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, then 'YES' is printed. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, then 'NO' is printed. If `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, then 'YES' is printed. If either of the conditions is not satisfied, then 'NO' is printed. This ensures that the program handles all possible scenarios and correctly outputs 'YES' or 'NO' based on the conditions provided.***
