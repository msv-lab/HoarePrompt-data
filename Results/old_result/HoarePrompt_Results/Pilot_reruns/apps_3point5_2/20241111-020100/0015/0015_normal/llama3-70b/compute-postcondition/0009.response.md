Functionality: **The function accepts three integers a, b, and c, and based on the conditions provided, it prints 'YES' if c is 0 and a is equal to b, or if the difference between b and a is divisible by c and the resulting division is non-negative. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The code does not handle the scenario where c is 0 and a is not equal to b, which is a missing edge case.**
