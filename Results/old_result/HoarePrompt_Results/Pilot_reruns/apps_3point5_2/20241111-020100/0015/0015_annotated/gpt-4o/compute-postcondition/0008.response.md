The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates with predefined integer variables `a`, `b`, and `c` within the specified constraints. After executing the function body, the function returns the maximum value among `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to determine and return the maximum value among the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` within the given constraints.
Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters. It returns the maximum value among the integers `a`, `b`, and `c` within the constraints -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.**
