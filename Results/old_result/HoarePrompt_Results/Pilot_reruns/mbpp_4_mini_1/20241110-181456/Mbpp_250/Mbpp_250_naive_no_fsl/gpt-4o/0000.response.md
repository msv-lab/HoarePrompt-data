Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a tuple and an element as input and accurately counts the occurrences of the specified element within the tuple using the `count` method. 

The assertions provided in the program test various scenarios:
1. It checks that the element `4` occurs `0` times in the tuple.
2. It verifies that the element `10` occurs `3` times in the tuple.
3. It confirms that the element `8` occurs `4` times in the tuple.

All the test cases are handled correctly, and there are no edge cases overlooked. The function will also work for any other valid inputs as per the problem description. Thus, I conclude that the program is correct.
