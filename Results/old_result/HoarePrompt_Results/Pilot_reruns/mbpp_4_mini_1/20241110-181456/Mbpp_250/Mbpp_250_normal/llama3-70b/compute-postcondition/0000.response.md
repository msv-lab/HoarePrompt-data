The function returns the count of occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. The initial state indicates that `tup` is a tuple, and `elem` can be of any data type. The return statement does not change the state of the variables but provides the count of `elem` in `tup`. Therefore, the output state is `tup` is a tuple, `elem` can be of any data type, and the function returns the count of `elem` in `tup`.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple, `elem` can be of any data type, and the function returns the count of `elem` in `tup`**
