Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly counts the occurrences of an element in a tuple using the `count` method, which is a built-in function specifically designed for this purpose. The assertions test various cases, including when the element is not present in the tuple (e.g., `4`), when it appears multiple times (e.g., `10`), and when it appears several times (e.g., `8`). All assertions accurately reflect the expected behavior of the program. Since I cannot find any case where the function does not meet the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
