The provided code is a function `func_1`, which is intended to take a list of lists (where each sublist should contain exactly two elements) and return a new list containing two lists: the first containing all the first elements of the sublists and the second containing all the second elements.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Correctness according to the description**: The code does indeed create two new lists, one for the first elements and one for the second elements of the sublists. However, the program assumes that each sublist will always contain two elements. If a sublist has fewer than two elements, it will raise an `IndexError`.
   
2. **Potential Edge Cases**: The code does not handle the case where a sublist might have fewer than two elements (for example, a sublist like `[1]` would cause an error). The problem description states that the input should consist of sublists with two elements, but it doesn't specify that there will not be any erroneous inputs. This lack of error handling leads to potential issues.

### Output Hints Assessment:
The output hints state that the function is expected to raise an `IndexError` if any sublist contains fewer than two elements. This aligns with the identified issue in the initial assessment.

### Conclusion:
The function does not handle potential edge cases where sublists may not contain exactly two elements. Since the program does not work correctly for all potential inputs as described (it will fail with an `IndexError` if any sublist has fewer than two elements), we conclude that the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**. 

The function does not properly account for cases where sublists do not have exactly two elements, which leads to an `IndexError`.
