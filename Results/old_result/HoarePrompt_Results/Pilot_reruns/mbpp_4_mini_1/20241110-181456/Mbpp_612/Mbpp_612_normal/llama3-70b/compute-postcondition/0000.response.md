The code returns a new list with two elements: the first being a list of the first elements from each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the second being a list of the second elements from each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Since `list_of_lists` is a list of sublists where each sublist contains exactly two elements, the output will reflect these extracted elements.

Assuming `list_of_lists` is structured as follows:
- Example: `list_of_lists = [[a1, b1], [a2, b2], [a3, b3], ...]`

The returned value will be:
- The first list will contain all the first elements: `[a1, a2, a3, ...]`
- The second list will contain all the second elements: `[b1, b2, b3, ...]`

Thus, the output state includes both the structure of `list_of_lists` and the result of the return statement.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of sublists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements; the function returns [[first elements], [second elements]]**
