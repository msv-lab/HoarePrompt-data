The function accepts a list of sublists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. It returns a list containing two sublists: the first sublist contains all the first elements from the original sublists, and the second sublist contains all the second elements. If any sublist does not contain exactly two elements, the function may raise an IndexError due to attempting to access non-existent elements.
