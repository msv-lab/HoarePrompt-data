The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of sublists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing two sublists: the first sublist consists of the first elements from each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the second sublist consists of the second elements from each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of sublists, where each sublist contains two elements, and return a list of two sublists containing the first and second elements from the original sublists.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of sublists containing exactly two elements each, and returns a list of two sublists: one with the first elements and one with the second elements from the original sublists.**
