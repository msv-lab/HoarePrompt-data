Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle cases where the input list of lists is empty or contains sublists that do not have exactly two elements. According to the problem description, the function should only accept a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. However, the code will raise an `IndexError` if it encounters an empty list or a sublist with fewer than two elements. 

For example, if the input is `[]` (an empty list), the function will attempt to access the first element of a nonexistent sublist, leading to an error. Similarly, if the input is `[[1]]` (a list with a single sublist that only contains one element), the code will also raise an `IndexError` when trying to access `sublist[1]`.

The annotations acknowledge that the function does not handle cases where `list_of_lists` is empty or contains sublists with fewer or more than two elements, indicating a clear understanding that these cases lead to errors. Therefore, the program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for every potential case, resulting in a determination of incorrectness.
