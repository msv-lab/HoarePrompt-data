The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`. `list_of_lists` is a list of sublists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements. After executing the function body, it returns a list containing two lists: one list for the first elements of each sublist and another list for the second elements of each sublist. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of sublists and return a list of two lists that separate the first and second elements of those sublists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of sublists containing exactly two elements each, and returns a list of two lists: one containing the first elements and the other containing the second elements of the sublists.**
