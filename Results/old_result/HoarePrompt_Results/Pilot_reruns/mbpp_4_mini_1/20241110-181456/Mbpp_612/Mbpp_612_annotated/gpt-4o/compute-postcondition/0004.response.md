The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is expected to be a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. It extracts the first and second elements from each sublist and returns them as two separate sublists within a single list. However, the function does not implement any checks for the validity of the input, meaning that if `list_of_lists` is empty or if any sublist does not contain exactly two elements, it could lead to an `IndexError`. Therefore, the functionality of the function should also consider these potential edge cases. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of lists containing exactly two elements each, extracts the first and second elements from each sublist, and returns them as two sublists within a list. However, it does not handle cases where `list_of_lists` is empty or contains sublists with fewer or more than two elements, which may result in an error. **
