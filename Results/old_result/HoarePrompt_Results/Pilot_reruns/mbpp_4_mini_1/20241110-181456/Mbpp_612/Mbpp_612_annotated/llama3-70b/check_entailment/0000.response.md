To determine the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and the code annotations, we'll analyze the program step by step.

### Problem Description:
The function should take a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements, and return a list of two lists:
1. The first list contains the first elements of each sublist.
2. The second list contains the second elements of each sublist.

### Annotations:
The annotations indicate that:
- The function assumes that each sublist in `list_of_lists` contains exactly two elements.
- If any sublist does not contain exactly two elements, the function will raise an `IndexError`.

### Code Analysis:
The code implementation is as follows:
```python
def func_1(list_of_lists):
    return [list(element[0] for element in list_of_lists), list(element[1] for element in list_of_lists)]
```
- The code uses list comprehensions to extract the first and second elements from each sublist.
- The function will indeed raise an `IndexError` if any of the sublists do not contain exactly two elements.

### Potential Issues:
1. **Empty Sublist Case**: If `list_of_lists` contains an empty sublist (e.g., `[[]]`), this will raise an `IndexError` because `element[0]` and `element[1]` will not exist.
2. **Single Element Sublist**: If any sublist contains only one element (e.g., `[[1], [2]]`), accessing the second element will also raise an `IndexError`.
3. **Sublist with More than Two Elements**: If any sublist contains more than two elements (e.g., `[[1, 2, 3], [4, 5, 6]]`), the function will still correctly access the first two elements, but the annotations suggest that it expects exactly two elements, which is not enforced in the code.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle the edge cases where sublists are empty or contain fewer than two elements, leading to potential `IndexError` exceptions. The annotations suggest that the function assumes all sublists contain exactly two elements, but the code does not enforce this condition. Therefore, the function does not meet the requirements of the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False** 

The program incorrectly assumes that all sublists will have exactly two elements, which can lead to runtime errors when this assumption is violated.
