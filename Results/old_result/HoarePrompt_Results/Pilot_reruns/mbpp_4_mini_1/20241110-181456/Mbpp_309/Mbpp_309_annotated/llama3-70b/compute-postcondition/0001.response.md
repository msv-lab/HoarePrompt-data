The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` can be any comparable values. After executing the function body, it returns the maximum of the two values, `max(a, b)`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two comparable values, `a` and `b`, and return the greater of the two. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, and returns the maximum value between a and b.**
