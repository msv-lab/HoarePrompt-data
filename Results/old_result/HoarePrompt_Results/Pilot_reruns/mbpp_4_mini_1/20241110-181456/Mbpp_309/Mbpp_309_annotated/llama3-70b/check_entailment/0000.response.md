Correctness: **False**

The provided program is intended to find the maximum of two numbers, which is in line with the problem description. However, it does not adequately handle the potential edge case of type compatibility mentioned in the annotations. 

The annotations state that the function accepts "any comparable values," including integers, floats, and strings. However, comparing strings and numbers directly in Python can lead to a `TypeError` in Python 3. For example, if we pass a string and an integer, such as `func_1("apple", 10)`, the function would raise an error rather than returning a valid maximum value.

This discrepancy indicates that the function does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, particularly when dealing with incompatible types. Therefore, the program is incorrect.
