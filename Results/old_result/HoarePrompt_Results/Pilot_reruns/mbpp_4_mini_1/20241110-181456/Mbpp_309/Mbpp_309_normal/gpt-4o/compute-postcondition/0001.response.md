The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are comparable values, such as integers or floats. After executing the function body, it returns the greater of the two values, either `a` or `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two comparable values `a` and `b`, and return the greater of the two. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the greater of the two values.**
