The function returns the maximum value between `a` and `b`. Since `a` and `b` can be any comparable data types, the specific maximum value cannot be determined without knowing their values. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` can be any comparable data types that support the max function, and the function returns the maximum of `a` and `b`.

Output State: **`a` and `b` can be any comparable data types that support the max function, and the function returns the maximum of `a` and `b`**
