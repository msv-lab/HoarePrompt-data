Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts complex numbers to polar coordinates by returning the magnitude (absolute value) and phase (angle) of the complex number. The use of the `abs` function to calculate the magnitude and `cmath.phase` to calculate the phase is appropriate. 

For any complex number `c`, the function will always provide the correct polar coordinates, as it handles all potential cases (including positive, negative, and zero values for both real and imaginary parts). The function does not contain any apparent edge cases or missing logic that would cause it to fail for any valid input. Therefore, it adheres to the problem description in all instances.
