Correctness: **False**

The problem description states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string. However, the provided program only retains uppercase characters and discards all lowercase characters, which does not align with the requirement to remove lowercase substrings. 

For example, consider the input string `'aBcDef'`. The expected behavior based on the problem description would be to remove the lowercase substrings, resulting in `'BDF'`. However, the actual output of the provided function would be `'BCDF'`, which is incorrect because it does not remove entire lowercase substrings; it only filters out lowercase characters individually.

Thus, the program does not fulfill the requirement of removing lowercase substrings, making it incorrect.
