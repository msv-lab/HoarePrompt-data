To analyze the provided program, let's break down the task based on the problem description and the code.

**Problem description:** Write a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    return ''.join([char for char in s if char.isupper()])
```

**Assertions:**
```python
assert func_1('PYTHon') == 'PYTH'
assert func_1('FInD') == 'FID'
assert func_1('STRinG') == 'STRG'
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a string `s` and returns a string consisting of all uppercase letters found in `s`, or an empty string if no uppercase letters are present.

### Initial Assessment
The provided function `func_1` filters the input string `s` to keep only uppercase characters. This seems to align with the problem description of "removing lowercase substrings" because effectively, the function is removing any character that is not uppercase.

### Edge Cases
1. **All lowercase input:** For example, `func_1('python')` should return an empty string, which it does.
2. **Empty string:** The function should also handle this case: `func_1('')` returns an empty string.
3. **Mixed case:** Strings with no uppercase letters (e.g., `'abcde'`) will also correctly return an empty string.
4. **Only uppercase:** A string made entirely of uppercase letters (e.g., `'HELLO'`) will return the same string.

### Output Hints Verification
The output hints accurately describe the functionâ€™s behavior:
- The function does return a string consisting of all uppercase letters found in `s`.
- If there are no uppercase letters, it returns an empty string.

### Conclusion
After evaluating the program against the problem description, checking the assertions, and considering potential edge cases, the function appears to correctly implement the requirement to remove lowercase substrings by retaining only uppercase characters.

Since I cannot find any edge case where the program does not work as expected, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly removes all lowercase characters from the string as required by the problem description and handles all edge cases appropriately.
