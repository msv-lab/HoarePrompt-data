The function returns a string that consists of all uppercase letters found in the string `s`. The value of `s` is not specified, but it is stated to contain both uppercase and lowercase letters. The return statement does not change the state of `s`, so the output state is `s` is a string containing both uppercase and lowercase letters, and the function returns the uppercase letters concatenated together.

Output State: **`s` is a string that may contain both uppercase and lowercase letters, and the function returns the uppercase letters concatenated together**
