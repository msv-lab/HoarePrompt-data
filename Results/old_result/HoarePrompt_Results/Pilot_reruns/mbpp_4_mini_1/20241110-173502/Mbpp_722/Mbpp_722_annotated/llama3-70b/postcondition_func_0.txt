The function accepts a dictionary `student_data` where keys are student names and values are tuples of their heights and weights, along with two float values `min_height` and `min_weight`. It returns a new dictionary containing only those students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. If no students meet the criteria, an empty dictionary is returned.
