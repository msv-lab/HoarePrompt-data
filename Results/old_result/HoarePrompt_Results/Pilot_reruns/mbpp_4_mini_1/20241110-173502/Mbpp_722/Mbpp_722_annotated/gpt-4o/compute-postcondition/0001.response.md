The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. 

- `student_dict` is a dictionary with string keys representing student names and values as tuples containing two float elements (student_height, student_weight). 
- `min_height` is a float value representing the minimum height requirement. 
- `min_weight` is a float value representing the minimum weight requirement. 

After executing the function body, it filters `student_dict` to return a new dictionary that includes only those students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and whose weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary of students with their heights and weights along with minimum height and weight values, and return a filtered dictionary of students that meet the specified height and weight criteria. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `student_dict` with student names and their heights and weights, along with float values `min_height` and `min_weight`, and returns a filtered dictionary of students with heights and weights that meet or exceed the minimum requirements.**
