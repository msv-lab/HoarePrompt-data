Functionality: ** The function accepts a dictionary `student_dict` where each key is a student's name (a string) and each value is a tuple containing their height and weight (both floats). Additionally, it accepts two float parameters, `min_height` and `min_weight`, representing minimum thresholds for filtering students. The function returns a new dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and whose weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. If no students meet the criteria, an empty dictionary is returned. **
