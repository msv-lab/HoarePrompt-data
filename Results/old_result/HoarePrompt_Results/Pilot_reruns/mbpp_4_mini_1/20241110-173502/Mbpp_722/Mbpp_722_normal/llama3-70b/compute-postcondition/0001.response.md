The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. `student_data` is a dictionary where each key is a string representing a student's name, and each value is a tuple of two floats representing the student's height and weight. `min_height` is a float representing the minimum height threshold, and `min_weight` is a float representing the minimum weight threshold. After executing the function body, the function returns a filtered dictionary that contains only those students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and whose weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a dictionary of student data along with minimum height and weight thresholds, and to return a filtered dictionary of students who meet these criteria. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `student_data` containing student names and their corresponding height and weight, along with two float parameters `min_height` and `min_weight`, and returns a filtered dictionary of students whose height and weight meet or exceed the specified thresholds.**
