The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` with the same parity, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `len(nums)`, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` with the same parity, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `len(nums)`, and `count` is increased by 1**
