Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` (where `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` with `j` ranging from `i + 1` to `len(nums) - 1`) that have the same parity (both even or both odd). If the length of `nums` is 1, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `len(nums) > 1`, the loop executes `len(nums) - 1 - i` times, where `i` is the initial index. Each execution checks if the XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even to increment `count`.**
