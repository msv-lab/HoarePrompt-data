Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` with the same parity. If the elements at indices `i` (which is `len(nums) - 1`) and `j` (which is `len(nums)`) have the same parity (i.e., if their XOR is even), then `count` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. This includes the consideration that `len(nums)` is greater than 1, ensuring valid indices for `i` and `j`.***
