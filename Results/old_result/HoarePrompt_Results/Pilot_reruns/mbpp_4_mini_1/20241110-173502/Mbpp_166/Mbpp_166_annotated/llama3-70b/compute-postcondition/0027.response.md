The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is not specified in the initial state. The variable `i` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` with the same parity that can be formed with the element at index `len(nums) - 2`, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, and `count` is now increased by 1.

Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` with the same parity that can be formed with the element at index `len(nums) - 2`, `i` is `len(nums) - 2`, and `count` is increased by 1**
