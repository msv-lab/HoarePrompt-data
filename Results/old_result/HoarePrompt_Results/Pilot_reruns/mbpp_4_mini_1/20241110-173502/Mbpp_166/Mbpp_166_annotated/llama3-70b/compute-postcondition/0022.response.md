Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` with the same parity. If the elements at indices `i` (which is `len(nums) - 1`) and `j` (which is `len(nums)`) have the same parity, then `count` is increased by 1. If `nums` has fewer than two elements, the condition cannot be evaluated, and `count` remains unchanged.***
