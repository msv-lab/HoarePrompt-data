Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` with the same parity that can be formed with the element at index `len(nums) - 2`. If the elements at index `len(nums) - 2` and `len(nums) - 1` have the same parity (i.e., their XOR is even), then `count` is incremented by 1. If they have different parities, `count` remains unchanged.***
