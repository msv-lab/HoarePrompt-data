The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The values of `i` and `j` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is incremented by 1, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `len(nums)`.

Output State: **`count` is incremented by 1, `i` is `len(nums) - 1`, `j` is `len(nums)`**
