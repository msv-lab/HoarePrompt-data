Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` remains unchanged unless the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number, in which case `count` is increased by 1. The conditions `j` is less than `len(nums)` and `i + 1` is less than `len(nums)` are maintained throughout the execution.***
