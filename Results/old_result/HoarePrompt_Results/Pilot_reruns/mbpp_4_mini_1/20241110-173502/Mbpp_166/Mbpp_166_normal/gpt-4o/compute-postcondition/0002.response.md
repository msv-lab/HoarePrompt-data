The code calculates the number of pairs of even integers from the list `lst`. The variable `even_pairs` is assigned the value of `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`, which represents the mathematical formula for combinations of two even integers from the count of even integers. The value of `even_count` is known, while the other variables are not affected by this calculation. 

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst; even_pairs` is calculated as `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`**
