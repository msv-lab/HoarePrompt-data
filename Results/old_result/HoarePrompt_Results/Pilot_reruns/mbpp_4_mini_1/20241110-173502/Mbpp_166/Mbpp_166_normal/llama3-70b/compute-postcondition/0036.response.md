Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both are either even or odd after checking all valid `j` indices. `i` is 2, `j` can be from 3 up to `len(nums) - 1`, and `len(nums)` is at least 3. If `len(nums)` is exactly 3, the loop executes only once. If `len(nums)` is less than 3, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains unchanged. The final value of `count` reflects the total pairs found among the elements starting from index `i` with valid `j` indices.**
