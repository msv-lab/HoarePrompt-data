The function returns the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs`. The values of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs` are previously calculated based on the counts of even and odd integers in `lst`. The return statement does not change the state of the other variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs` as well as the result of the return statement.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`; `even_pairs` is calculated as `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`; `odd_pairs` is calculated as `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`; and the function returns `even_pairs + odd_pairs`.**
