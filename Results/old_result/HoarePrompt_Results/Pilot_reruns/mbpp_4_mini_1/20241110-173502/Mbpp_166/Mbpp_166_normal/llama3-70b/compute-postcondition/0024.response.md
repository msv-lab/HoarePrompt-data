Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both are either even or odd, `i` is 1, `j` is the index of the last element in `nums`, and `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If `len(nums)` is 2, the loop will execute once. If `len(nums)` is greater than 2, the loop will execute `len(nums) - 1` times. If `len(nums)` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `count` remains unchanged. The count will increment for every pair where both elements are either even or odd.**
