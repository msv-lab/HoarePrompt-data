Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both are either even or odd. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even (indicating that both numbers are either even or odd), then `count` is incremented by 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain 1 and 4 respectively, and `nums` is a list of integers with at least 5 elements.***
