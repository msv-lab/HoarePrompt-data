Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and returns True if `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order; otherwise, it returns False. The function does not handle cases where `lst` is empty or contains only one element, but by definition, an empty list or a single-element list can be considered sorted. Therefore, it will return True for these cases as well. **
