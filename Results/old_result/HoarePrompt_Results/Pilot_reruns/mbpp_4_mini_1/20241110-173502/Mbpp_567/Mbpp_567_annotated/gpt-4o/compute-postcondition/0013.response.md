Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and returns `False` if any element is greater than the next element in the list, indicating that the list is not sorted in non-decreasing order. If `lst` has 0 or 1 element, the function implicitly returns `True` since there are no elements to compare. If `lst` has at least 2 elements and is sorted in non-decreasing order, the function returns `True`. The function does not explicitly handle the case for lists with 0 or 1 element, which could lead to ambiguity in its behavior. **
