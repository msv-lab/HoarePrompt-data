Output State: **If lst is a list with at least 2 elements, the loop iterates through the elements comparing each element with the next one. If any element at index i is greater than the element at index i+1, the function returns False. If the list has 0 or 1 element, the loop does not execute, and thus no comparisons are made, implying the function would return None or True if it were set to do so. If lst is sorted in non-decreasing order, the loop completes without returning False.**
