The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of comparable elements. If `lst` is a list with at least 2 elements, the function iterates through the elements comparing each element with the next one. If any element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i+1`, the function returns `False`. If `lst` has 0 or 1 element, the loop does not execute, and thus no comparisons are made, implying the function would return `None` or `True` if it were set to do so. If `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order, the loop completes without returning `False`, leading to Case_2 where the function returns `True`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `lst`, and returns `False` if any element is greater than the next one in the list. If `lst` has 0 or 1 element, the function returns None or True. If `lst` is sorted in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`.**
