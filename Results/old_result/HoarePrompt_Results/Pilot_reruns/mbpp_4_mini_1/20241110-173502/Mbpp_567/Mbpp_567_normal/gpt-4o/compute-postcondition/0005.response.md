Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1. If `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, the function returns False. If `lst[i]` is less than or equal to `lst[i + 1]`, the function does not return anything, implying that the comparison does not indicate a return condition.***
