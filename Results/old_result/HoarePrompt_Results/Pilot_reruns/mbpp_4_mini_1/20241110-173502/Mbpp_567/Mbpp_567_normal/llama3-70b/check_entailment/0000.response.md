The provided program aims to check whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. Let's analyze the code and its compliance with the problem description.

**Code:**
```python
def func_1(lst):
    return all((lst[i] <= lst[i + 1] for i in range(len(lst) - 1)))
```

**Initial Assessment:**
1. The function uses a generator expression with `all()` to check if each element in the list is less than or equal to the next element.
2. It correctly iterates through the list up to the second-to-last element, comparing each element with the one that follows it.
3. The function should return `True` for an empty list or a single-element list because they are considered sorted by definition.

**Edge Cases Consideration:**
- An empty list (`[]`) should return `True`.
- A single-element list (`[5]`) should return `True`.
- A two-element sorted list (`[1, 2]`) should return `True`.
- A two-element unsorted list (`[2, 1]`) should return `False`.
- A list with duplicate elements (`[1, 1, 1]`) should return `True`.

**Output Hints:**
The output hints state that the function accepts a list of comparable elements and returns `True` if the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, and it correctly handles empty lists and single-element lists. 

Upon reviewing both the code and the output hints, I find that the function correctly implements the logic to check whether the list is sorted and adheres to the problem description, including handling the edge cases appropriately.

**Conclusion:**
Since the function handles all potential cases described in the problem accurately, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

The code is correct because it correctly identifies sorted and unsorted lists, including handling edge cases like empty lists and single-element lists as sorted.
