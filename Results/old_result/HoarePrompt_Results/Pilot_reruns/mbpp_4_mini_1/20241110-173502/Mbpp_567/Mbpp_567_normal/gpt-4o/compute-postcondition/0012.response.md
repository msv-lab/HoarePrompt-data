The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of elements that can be compared using the greater-than operator. If `lst` has at least 2 elements, the function checks adjacent elements in the list. If any element is greater than the next one, the function returns `False`. If `lst` has fewer than 2 elements, the function does not return anything and retains its original state. If all adjacent elements are in non-decreasing order, the function returns `True`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and determine if the elements in the list are in non-decreasing order, returning `False` if they are not, and `True` if they are. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and returns `False` if any adjacent elements are in decreasing order; if all adjacent elements are in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`. If `lst` has fewer than 2 elements, it does not return anything.**
