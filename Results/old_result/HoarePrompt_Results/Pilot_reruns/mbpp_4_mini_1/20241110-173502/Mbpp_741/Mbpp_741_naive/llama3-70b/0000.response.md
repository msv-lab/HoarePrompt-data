Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(s: str) -> bool` checks if all characters in the input string `s` are the same by converting the string into a set, which inherently removes duplicates. If the length of this set is `1`, it means all characters in the string were the same. 

This function handles all potential edge cases effectively:
- For an empty string, `set("")` results in an empty set, and `len(set(""))` equals `0`, which correctly indicates that not all characters are the same (as there are no characters).
- For a single character string, `set("a")` results in a set with one element, and `len(set("a"))` equals `1`, indicating that all characters (in this case, just one) are the same.
- For strings with multiple identical characters, like `"aaaa"`, the set will contain a single element, resulting in `True`.
- For strings with different characters, like `"abc"`, the set will contain three different elements, resulting in `False`.

Therefore, the function behaves correctly for all potential inputs.
