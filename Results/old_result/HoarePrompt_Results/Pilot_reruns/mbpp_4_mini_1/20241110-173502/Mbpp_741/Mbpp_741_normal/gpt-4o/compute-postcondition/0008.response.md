Postcondition: ***`s` is a string with at least 1 character. If `char`, the second character of `s`, is not equal to `first_char`, the first character of `s`, then the function returns False. If `char` is equal to `first_char`, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns None), which is a case that is not explicitly covered in the code but should be considered.***
