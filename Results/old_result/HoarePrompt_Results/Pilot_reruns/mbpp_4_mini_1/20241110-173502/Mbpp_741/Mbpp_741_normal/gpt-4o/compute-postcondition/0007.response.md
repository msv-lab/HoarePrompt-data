The function returns `False`, and the initial state shows that `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the next character in `s`. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state remains the same with the addition of the returned value.

Output State: **`s` is a string with at least 1 character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the next character in `s`, and the function returns False**
