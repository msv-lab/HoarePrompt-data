The function returns `False`, and `s` is a string with at least 1 character, and `first_char` is the first character of `s`. The return statement does not change the state of `s` or `first_char`, so the output state is `s` is a string with at least 1 character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and the function returns `False`.

Output State: **`s` is a string with at least 1 character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and the function returns False**
