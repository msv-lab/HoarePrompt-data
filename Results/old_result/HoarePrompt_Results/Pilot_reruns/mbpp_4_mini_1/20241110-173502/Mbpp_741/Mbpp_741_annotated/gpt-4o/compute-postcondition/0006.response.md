According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. Since `s` contains at least 1 character, the loop can iterate over its characters. At the end of the last iteration, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is also the first character of `s`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `char` needs to be updated to the next character in the string `s`, and the loop will continue as long as there are more characters in `s`.

Assuming `s` has more than one character, we need to adjust `char` to the next character after the first character, and the current position of `char` should reflect that.

State: **`s` contains at least 1 character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character of `s`**
