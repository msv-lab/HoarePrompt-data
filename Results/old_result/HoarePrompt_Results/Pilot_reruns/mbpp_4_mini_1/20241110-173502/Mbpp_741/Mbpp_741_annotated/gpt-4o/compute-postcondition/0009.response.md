According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop will continue executing. At the end of the last iteration, `s` contains at least 1 character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the second character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to represent the next character in the string `s`. 

Since `char` is currently the second character, the next character would be the third character in the string. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `s` must contain at least 3 characters, and `char` should be updated to the third character of `s`.

State: **`s` contains at least 3 characters, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the third character of `s`.**
