Output State: **If `s` is empty, the function returns True and no iteration occurs. If `s` contains at least one character, `first_char` is the first character of `s`. After the loop executes, if all characters in `s` are equal to `first_char`, the function does not return anything (implicitly returning None). If any character is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns False immediately. Therefore, if `s` contains only one unique character, the function will complete the loop without returning, and if `s` contains different characters, it will return False at the first mismatch.**
