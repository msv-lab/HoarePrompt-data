The function returns the result of the expression `len(set(s)) == 1`. The `set(s)` creates a set of unique characters from the string `s`, and `len(set(s))` counts the number of unique characters. If the length is `1`, it means all characters in `s` are the same. The state of the variable `s` is not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state is `s` is a string consisting of characters, and the function returns a boolean indicating whether all characters in `s` are the same.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of characters, and the function returns a boolean indicating whether all characters in `s` are the same**
