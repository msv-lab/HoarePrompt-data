The function returns `True`. The variable `tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, and `item` is the second element in the tuple. The return statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is `tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in the tuple, and the function returns `True`.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `item` is the second element in the tuple, and the function returns True**
