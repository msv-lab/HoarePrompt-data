Correctness: **True**

The provided function correctly adds the elements of the tuple to the given list. The use of `list(tpl)` effectively converts the tuple into a list, allowing for the concatenation of the two lists using the `+` operator. The assertions given also demonstrate that for the provided test cases, the function behaves as expected.

To validate the correctness further, let's consider potential edge cases:

1. **Empty Tuple**: When the tuple is empty, e.g., `func_1([1, 2, 3], ())`, the function should return `[1, 2, 3]` since adding an empty list should not change the original list.
2. **Empty List**: When the list is empty, e.g., `func_1([], (4, 5))`, it should return `[4, 5]`, which is the expected behavior.
3. **Both Empty**: When both the list and tuple are empty, e.g., `func_1([], ())`, it should return an empty list `[]`.
4. **Single Element Tuple**: When the tuple has a single element, e.g., `func_1([1], (2,))`, it should return `[1, 2]`.

In all these edge cases, the function works as intended. Therefore, the function meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
