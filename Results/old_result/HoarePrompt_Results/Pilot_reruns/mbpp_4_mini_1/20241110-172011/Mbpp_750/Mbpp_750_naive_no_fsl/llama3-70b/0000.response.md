To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the function and the requirements:

**Problem Description:** Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst, tup):
    return lst + list(tup)
```

### Analysis:

1. **Functionality**: The function takes a list (`lst`) and a tuple (`tup`) as inputs. It converts the tuple to a list using `list(tup)` and then concatenates it to the original list using the `+` operator.

2. **Expected Behavior**: The expected behavior is to return a new list that includes all the elements from the original list followed by all the elements from the tuple.

### Testing Edge Cases:

- **Case 1**: If `lst` is an empty list and `tup` is a non-empty tuple.
  - Input: `func_1([], (1, 2, 3))`
  - Expected Output: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - Actual Output: `[1, 2, 3]` (Correct)

- **Case 2**: If `lst` is a non-empty list and `tup` is an empty tuple.
  - Input: `func_1([4, 5, 6], ())`
  - Expected Output: `[4, 5, 6]`
  - Actual Output: `[4, 5, 6]` (Correct)

- **Case 3**: If both `lst` and `tup` are empty.
  - Input: `func_1([], ())`
  - Expected Output: `[]`
  - Actual Output: `[]` (Correct)

- **Case 4**: If `lst` contains mixed data types and `tup` also contains mixed data types.
  - Input: `func_1([1, 'a'], (2, 'b'))`
  - Expected Output: `[1, 'a', 2, 'b']`
  - Actual Output: `[1, 'a', 2, 'b']` (Correct)

### Conclusion:

After testing various edge cases, the function behaves as expected under all potential scenarios described in the problem statement. It correctly combines the elements of the tuple with the elements of the list regardless of whether they are empty or contain a mixture of data types.

**Correctness: True**
