Let's analyze the provided Python program against the problem description and the output hints.

**Problem description:** Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst, tup):
    return lst + list(tup)
```

**Output hints:** The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tup`. If `lst` is empty, the function will still return a list containing the elements of `tup`. If `tup` is empty, the function will return `lst` unchanged.

### Initial Assessment:
1. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`.
2. It converts the tuple to a list and concatenates it with the original list.
3. This means that:
   - If `lst` is empty, the result will simply be the elements of `tup` in a list.
   - If `tup` is empty, it will return `lst` unchanged, as adding an empty list to any list returns the original list.
4. The program seems to handle these cases correctly based on the given description.

### Edge Cases:
- **Case 1:** If both `lst` and `tup` are empty:
  - Input: `func_1([], ())`
  - Expected Output: `[]` (an empty list)
  - The function will return `[]`, which is correct.
  
- **Case 2:** If `lst` is empty and `tup` is non-empty:
  - Input: `func_1([], (1, 2, 3))`
  - Expected Output: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - The function will return `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.
  
- **Case 3:** If `lst` is non-empty and `tup` is empty:
  - Input: `func_1([1, 2, 3], ())`
  - Expected Output: `[1, 2, 3]`
  - The function will return `[1, 2, 3]`, which is correct.
  
- **Case 4:** If both `lst` and `tup` are non-empty:
  - Input: `func_1([1, 2], (3, 4))`
  - Expected Output: `[1, 2, 3, 4]`
  - The function will return `[1, 2, 3, 4]`, which is correct.

### Output Hints Confirmation:
The output hints specify that:
- The function will return a list containing the elements of `tup` if `lst` is empty.
- The function will return `lst` unchanged if `tup` is empty.
These points align perfectly with the function implementation provided.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the functionality as described in the problem statement and handles all edge cases appropriately. No case has been found where the function does not perform as expected.

Correctness: **True**.
