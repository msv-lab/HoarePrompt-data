The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tup`. The parameter `lst` is a list, and the parameter `tup` is a tuple. After executing the function body, it returns the concatenation of `lst` and the converted tuple into a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and return the combination of `lst` with the elements of `tup` converted into a list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst (a list) and tup (a tuple), and returns the concatenation of lst and the elements of tup as a list.**
