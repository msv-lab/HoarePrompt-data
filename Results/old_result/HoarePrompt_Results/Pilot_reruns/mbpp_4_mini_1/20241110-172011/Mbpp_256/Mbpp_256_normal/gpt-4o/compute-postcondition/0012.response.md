The loop marks multiples of `i` as non-prime in the `is_prime` list, starting from `i * i` and incrementing by `i` until `n`. Given the initial state where `n` is at least 2 and `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are both False, the loop's behavior can be summarized as follows:

1. The loop will execute for `j` starting at `i * i` and going up to (but not including) `n`, stepping by `i`.
2. If `i` is 2, the loop will mark all even numbers greater than or equal to 4 as non-prime.
3. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

Considering these points:

- If `n` is greater than 2, the loop will execute at least once since `j` starts at `4`.
- If `n` is equal to 2, the loop will not execute at all, and the `is_prime` list will remain unchanged from its initialization except for the first two entries.

Now, let's summarize the output state after the loop executes:

Output State: **If n is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[4]` is False for the first iteration, and all even indices up to `n` will be False for subsequent iterations. If n is equal to 2, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged with `is_prime[0]` is False and `is_prime[1]` is False.**
