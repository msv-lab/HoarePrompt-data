The assignment `is_prime[j] = False` sets the value at index `j` of the `is_prime` list to `False`. The initial state specifies that `is_prime[j]` is already `False`, so this assignment does not change the state of `is_prime[j]`. Other variables are not affected by this operation. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i + i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[j]` is False for some index `j`, and `j` is equal to `i * i + i`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i * i + i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[j]` is False for some index `j`, and `j` is equal to `i * i + i`**
