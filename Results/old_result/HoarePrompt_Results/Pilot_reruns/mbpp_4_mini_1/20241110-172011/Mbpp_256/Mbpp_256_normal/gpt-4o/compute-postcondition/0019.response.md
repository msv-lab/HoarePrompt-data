According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, it is given that `n` is greater than or equal to `i * i + i`, and `i` is less than or equal to int(sqrt(n)). 

Since `j` starts at `i * i` and increments by `i`, we need to determine the value of `j` at the end of the last iteration. If we assume that `j` was equal to `i * i + k * i` for some integer `k` (where `k` is the number of completed iterations), then to execute the loop one more time, `j` must be increased by `i`. 

Thus, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `j` is less than `n` after this increment. Therefore, we adjust `j` to `j` being equal to `i * i + (k + 1) * i`, which is just one increment of `i` from its previous value. 

The conditions imply that `j` must also remain less than `n`, and since `n` must still be greater than or equal to `i * i + i`, this condition will hold true if we increment `j` correctly.

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect this increment and ensure the loop can run again. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to `i * i + i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[j]` is False for some index `j`, `j` is equal to `i * i + i`**
