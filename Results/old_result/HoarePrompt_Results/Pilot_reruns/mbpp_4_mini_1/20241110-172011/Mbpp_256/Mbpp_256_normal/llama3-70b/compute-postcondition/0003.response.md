The function returns `False`, and `num` is either 2 or greater, and `i` is 2. The return statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is `num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2, and the function returns `False`.

Output State: **`num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2, and the function returns False**
