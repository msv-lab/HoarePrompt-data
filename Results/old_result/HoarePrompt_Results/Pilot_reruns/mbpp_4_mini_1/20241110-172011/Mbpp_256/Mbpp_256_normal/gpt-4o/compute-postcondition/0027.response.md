According to the code, the loop iterates over a range starting from `i * i` up to `n`, with a step of `i`. The condition for the loop to execute again depends on the values of `j` and `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i * i`, and `n` is greater than `i * i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently set to `i * i`, the next value of `j` will be `j + i` (i.e., `i * i + i`).

Therefore, we need to ensure that `j + i` (which is `i * i + i`) is still less than `n`. Thus, we need to adjust `n` to ensure it is greater than `i * i + i`.

Additionally, the variables `j` and `is_prime[j]` need to be updated for the next iteration. After the current iteration, `j` should be updated to `i * i + i`.

State: **`n` is greater than `i * i + i`, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `is_prime[j]` is set to False, `i` is greater than or equal to 2, `j` is `i * i + i`**
