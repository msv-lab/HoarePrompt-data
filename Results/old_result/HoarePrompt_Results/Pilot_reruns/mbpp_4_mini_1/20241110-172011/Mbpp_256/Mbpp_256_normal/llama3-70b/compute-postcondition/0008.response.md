According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the value of `num`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4.

Additionally, we need to ensure that `num` is still appropriate for the loop to run again. The upper limit for `i` is `int(num ** 0.5)`, which means `num` must be such that `int(num ** 0.5)` is at least 4. Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `num` must be at least 16 (since \( \sqrt{16} = 4 \)).

Thus, the updated state needs to reflect that `num` is 16 or greater, `i` is 4, and we do not have any other specific state changes needed.

State: **`num` is 16 or greater, `i` is 4**
