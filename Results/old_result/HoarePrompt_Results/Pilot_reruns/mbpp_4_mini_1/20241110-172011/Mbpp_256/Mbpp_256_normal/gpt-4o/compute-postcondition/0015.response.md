According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. Given that `i` is initialized as `int(n)`, it is assumed that `i` will take on an integer value equal to `n`. 

The loop range is defined as `range(i * i, n, i)`, which means that the starting point of the loop (`i * i`) must be less than `n` in order for the loop to execute. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, if `i` is equal to `n`, then `i * i` will be greater than `n` (as `n * n` is definitely greater than `n` when `n >= 2`). Consequently, the loop will not execute.

To ensure that the loop can execute, `i` must be set to a value that allows `i * i` to be less than `n`. This implies that `i` should be less than or equal to the square root of `n`. 

Thus, we can adjust the state to reflect that `i` must be less than or equal to the largest integer less than or equal to the square root of `n`, which allows the loop to potentially execute.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to False, `i` is less than or equal to int(sqrt(n))**
