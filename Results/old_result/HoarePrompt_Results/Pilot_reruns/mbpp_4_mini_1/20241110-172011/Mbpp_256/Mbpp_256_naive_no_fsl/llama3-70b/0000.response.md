Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number \( n \). 

Here's a breakdown of how the program addresses the problem description:

1. **Prime Number Definition**: The function `is_prime` correctly identifies whether a number is prime. It returns `False` for numbers less than 2 (as 0 and 1 are not prime), and checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient way to determine primality.

2. **Counting Primes**: The main function `func_1` iterates through all numbers from 2 to \( n-1 \) (exclusive of \( n \)) and uses `is_prime` to check if each number is prime. It increments the `count` for each prime found.

3. **Edge Cases**: 
   - If \( n = 0 \) or \( n = 1 \), the function will correctly return 0, as there are no prime numbers less than these values. 
   - For any \( n \geq 2 \), it counts the primes less than \( n \) accurately.

Since the function behaves as expected for all non-negative integer inputs and correctly counts prime numbers less than the given number, it meets the requirements described in the problem statement. Thus, I conclude the program is correct.
