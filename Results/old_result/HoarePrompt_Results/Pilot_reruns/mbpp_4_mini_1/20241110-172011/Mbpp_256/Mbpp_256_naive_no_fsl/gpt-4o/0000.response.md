To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze it against the problem description: "Write a python function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number."

### Analysis of the Program:

1. **Input Handling**:
   - The function starts by checking if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If it is, it returns 0, which is correct because there are no prime numbers less than 2.

2. **Sieve of Eratosthenes**:
   - The program uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to mark non-prime numbers. It initializes a list `is_prime` with `True` values for all indices up to `n`, then marks 0 and 1 as `False` since they are not prime.
   - The outer loop iterates from 2 to the square root of `n`, and for each prime number found, it marks its multiples as non-prime.

3. **Count of Primes**:
   - Finally, the program sums the `is_prime` list to count the number of `True` values, which gives the count of prime numbers less than `n`.

### Testing Edge Cases:

Let's consider the edge case when the input is 0 or 1:

- **For `n = 0`**:
  - The function will return 0, as there are no prime numbers less than 0. This is correct.
  
- **For `n = 1`**:
  - The function will return 0, as there are no prime numbers less than 1. This is also correct.

- **For `n = 2`**:
  - The function will return 0, as there are no prime numbers less than 2. This is correct as well.

- **For `n = 3`**:
  - The function should return 1 (only the prime number 2 is less than 3). The function will correctly identify that 2 is prime.

- **For `n = 4`**:
  - The function should return 2 (the prime numbers 2 and 3 are less than 4). The function will correctly identify both.

- **For `n = 5`**:
  - The function should return 2 (the prime numbers 2 and 3 are less than 5). The function will correctly identify both.

- **For `n = 10`**:
  - The function should return 4 (the prime numbers 2, 3, 5, and 7 are less than 10). The function will correctly identify all.

### Conclusion:

The function handles all potential edge cases correctly and adheres to the problem description. Thus, based on the analysis and testing of various cases, we conclude:

Correctness: **True**
