The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2, and counts the number of prime numbers less than `n` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm for values of `n` greater than 2. However, it incorrectly handles the case when `n` is equal to 3 by not explicitly returning the expected count.
