According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, the following states are true:
- `n` is greater than 15
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 15

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `j` (which is 15) is less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 15, we can conclude that the loop can execute again.

Now, let's consider how `j` will be updated in the next iteration. The loop increments `j` by `i` (which is 3). Therefore, in the next iteration, `j` will become:
- `j = 15 + 3 = 18`

Since `j` will be 18 in the next iteration, we need to ensure that `n` remains greater than 18 to allow the loop to execute again.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `n` must be greater than 18.

State: **`n` is greater than 18, `i` is 3, `j` is 18, `is_prime[12]` is False, `is_prime[9]` is False, `is_prime[15]` is False**
