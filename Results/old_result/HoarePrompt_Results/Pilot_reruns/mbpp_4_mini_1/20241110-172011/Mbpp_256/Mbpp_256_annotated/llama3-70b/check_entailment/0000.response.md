To verify the correctness of the provided Python program, we must analyze both the functions `func_1` and `is_prime`, along with the associated problem description and annotations.

### Problem Description
The program is supposed to take a non-negative number `n` and return the number of prime numbers less than `n`.

### Annotations Review
1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - When `n` is exactly 2, the function returns 0 since there are no prime numbers in the range [2, 2).
   - It correctly counts primes for `n > 2` by iterating from 2 to `n-1`.

2. **Function `is_prime(num)`**:
   - If `num < 2`, it returns `False`, which is correct.
   - It checks if a number is prime by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number.
   - It properly handles the case for `num` equal to 2 by returning `True`.

### Edge Case Analysis
However, the annotation for the `is_prime` function indicates a potential flaw:
- The comment states that if `num` is odd and greater than 2, it may not explicitly return a value if `num` is not divisible by any integer up to its square root. This implies that in some cases, if `num` is a prime number, there might not be a return statement executed, which would lead to the function exiting without a return value (implicitly returning `None`).

### Example of Incorrect Behavior
Consider the case when `num` is 9 (which is odd and greater than 2):
1. The function `is_prime(9)` would iterate through `i = 2` and `i = 3` (as the square root of 9 is 3).
2. It would find that 9 is divisible by 3 and return `False`, which is correct.
3. However, if we check `is_prime(7)`, it will not find any divisors and will reach the end of the function without hitting a return statement. The function will then return `None`, which is incorrect as it should return `True`.

This lack of a return statement for prime numbers greater than 2 indicates that the function does not handle all cases properly. 

### Conclusion
Since the program does not correctly handle all cases, particularly not ensuring a return value for odd prime numbers greater than 2, it fails to meet the problem's requirements.

Correctness: **False** 

The program is incorrect because it may not return a value for certain odd prime numbers greater than 2, leading to unexpected behavior.
