Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[2:n]` are all True. If `is_prime[i]` is True, then `is_prime[j]` is set to False for all `j` starting from `i * i` up to `n`, incremented by `i`. If `i * i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged for indices from `0` to `n-1`, preserving `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, and `is_prime[2:n]` still True.***
