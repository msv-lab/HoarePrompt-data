According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The range for `i` starts from 2 and goes to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute, `int(n ** 0.5)` must be at least 2, which means `n` needs to be at least 4 (since the square root of 4 is 2). 

Given that `n` is a non-negative integer, if `n` is less than 4, the loop will not execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 4 for the loop to run. If `n` is 4 or greater, `i` will start at 2.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True, `i` is 2**
