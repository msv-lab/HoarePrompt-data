The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a non-negative integer. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns `False`. If `num` is equal to 2, the function completes without returning a value, which can be interpreted as returning `True` since 2 is a prime number. If `num` is greater than 2, the function checks for divisibility by integers starting from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is odd and greater than 2 and not divisible by any integers up to the square root of `num`, the function completes without returning a value, suggesting that `num` may be a prime number, but this is not explicitly stated.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter num, returns `False` if `num` is less than 2, returns `True` if `num` is 2, and returns `False` if `num` is not prime (divisible by any integer up to its square root). If `num` is an odd integer greater than 2 and not divisible by any integer up to its square root, the function may complete without returning a value, implying it could be prime.**
