To analyze the provided loop's output state, let's consider the behavior of the loop based on the initial state and the code.

1. The loop iterates over `i` from `2` to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. This means if `n` is less than `4`, the loop will not execute because `int(n ** 0.5)` will be less than `2`, leading to no valid range for `i`. 

2. If the loop executes, it checks if `is_prime[i]` is `True`. If it is, it marks all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` to `n` as non-prime by setting `is_prime[j]` to `False`.

3. The loop's main purpose is to sieve out non-prime numbers in the `is_prime` list.

Given the above understanding, let's derive the output states for various scenarios:

### Output State after the loop executes 1 time:
If `n` is at least `4`, `is_prime[0]` is `False`, `is_prime[1]` is `False`, and `is_prime[2:n]` are all `True`. If the loop executes once with `i = 2`, all multiples of `2` starting from `4` (i.e., `4, 6, 8, ..., n-1`) are marked as `False` in `is_prime`. If `n` is exactly `4`, `is_prime[4]` is `False`. For `n` greater than `4`, additional multiples of `2` will also be marked as `False`.

### Output State after the loop executes 2 times:
If `n` is at least `4`, `is_prime[0]` is `False`, `is_prime[1]` is `False`, and `is_prime[2:n]` are all `True`. On the second execution with `i = 3`, if `n` is at least `9`, all multiples of `3` starting from `9` (i.e., `9, 12, 15, ..., n-1`) are marked as `False` in `is_prime`. If `n` is less than `9`, the `is_prime` array remains unchanged for indices `9` and above.

### Output State after the loop executes 3 times:
If `n` is at least `4`, `is_prime[0]` is `False`, `is_prime[1]` is `False`, and `is_prime[2:n]` are all `True`. After the third execution with `i = 4`, since `is_prime[4]` is `False`, this iteration will not mark any numbers as `False`, and the state of `is_prime` remains unchanged. 

### Edge Cases:
- If `n` is less than `2`, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime[0]` is `False`, `is_prime[1]` is `False`, and `is_prime[2:n]` is empty.
- If `n` is exactly `2` or `3`, the loop will not execute since `int(n ** 0.5)` will be less than `2`.

With these considerations, here is the final output state:

Output State: **If n is at least 4, is_prime[j] is False for all j that are multiples of 2 and 3 up to n. If n is less than 4, the loop does not execute, and is_prime[0] remains False, is_prime[1] remains False, and is_prime[2:n] is unchanged (True for 2 and potentially empty for n < 2).**
