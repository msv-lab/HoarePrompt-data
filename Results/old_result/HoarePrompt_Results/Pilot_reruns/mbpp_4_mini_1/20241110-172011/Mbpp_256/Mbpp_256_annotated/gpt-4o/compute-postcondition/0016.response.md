The statement `is_prime[j] = False` indicates that the value at index `j` of the list `is_prime` is being set to `False`. The variable `j` must be defined and is likely within the context of a loop checking for prime numbers, which is common in algorithms for marking non-prime indices in the Sieve of Eratosthenes.

From the initial state, `is_prime[0]` is `False`, `is_prime[1]` is `False`, and `is_prime[2:n]` are all `True`, indicating that all numbers from 2 to n-1 are initially considered prime. 

The value of `j` is not provided, but we know it must be within the bounds of the array and relevant to the operation being conducted (e.g., marking multiples of a prime as non-prime). The operation changes one specific entry of the `is_prime` list to `False`, and this does not affect other variables or the overall structure of the list aside from the index `j`.

Thus, the output state will reflect that a specific index of `is_prime` has been updated to `False`, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True; `is_prime[j]` is False**
