The loop iterates over multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n`, marking them as non-prime (i.e., setting `is_prime[j]` to False). Given that `i` starts at 2 and `n` is at least 4, the loop will execute for each multiple of `i` that is less than `n`.

The loop will execute at least once if `n` is at least 4. If `n` is exactly 4, the loop will execute once, marking `is_prime[4]` as False. If `n` is greater than 4, the loop will execute multiple times, marking additional multiples of `2` as non-prime (such as `6`, `8`, etc.) until it reaches the limit of `n`.

If `n` is less than 4, the loop will not execute since the initial condition states that `n` is at least 4. 

Output State: **`is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2:n]` are all True for `n` greater than 4, `is_prime[j]` is False for all j that are multiples of 2 up to n, `i` is 2, and `j` is the current multiple of `i` being processed. If `n` is exactly 4, then `is_prime[4]` is False, and the loop executes once. If `n` is less than 4, the loop does not execute and the state remains unchanged.**
