According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute for `j` starting from `i * i`, which is `3 * 3 = 9`, and incrementing by `i` (which is 3) until it reaches `n`. 

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and since `i` is 3, `i * i` evaluates to 9. Therefore, `j` will start at 9. Since `n` is at least 4, `j` (which starts at 9) is already greater than `n`, meaning the loop will not execute.

To ensure that the loop can execute, we need to adjust `n` to be greater than `i * i`, which is 9. Hence, `n` must be greater than 9. 

Also, before the loop, `j` should be initialized to `i * i`, which is 9. However, since the loop will not run, we can state the necessary conditions for the loop to potentially execute correctly.

State: **`n` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, `j` is 9**
