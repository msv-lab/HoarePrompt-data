Correctness: **True**.

The function `func_1(n)` correctly finds the last digit of the factorial for non-negative integers. The logic employed in the function is as follows:

1. If `n` is 5 or greater, the function correctly returns 0, as the last digit of the factorial of any number 5 or larger is 0 (due to the presence of both 2 and 5 as factors, which create a trailing zero).
2. For values of `n` less than 5, it calculates the factorial iteratively and returns the last digit (using `factorial % 10`).

The assertions provided (`func_1(4) == 4`, `func_1(21) == 0`, `func_1(30) == 0`) confirm that the function behaves as expected for the tested cases. Since there are no edge cases or missed conditions identified that would cause the function to fail, it is correct.
