Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `0` if `n` is greater than or equal to 5. If `n` is less than 5, it calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of that factorial (i.e., `factorial % 10`). The function correctly handles values of `n` from 0 to 4, but it lacks the implementation for calculating the factorial and returning the last digit for values of `n` less than 5, which should be addressed. **
