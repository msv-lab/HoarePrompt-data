To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the code and the output hints.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that finds the last digit in the factorial of a given number.

### Program:
```python
assert func_1(4) == 4
assert func_1(21) == 0
assert func_1(30) == 0
def func_1(n):
    if n >= 5:
        return 0
    else:
        factorial = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            factorial *= i
        return factorial % 10
assert func_1(4) == 4
assert func_1(21) == 0
assert func_1(30) == 0
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `0` if `n` is greater than or equal to 5. If `n` is less than 5, it calculates the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of that factorial (i.e., `factorial % 10`). The function correctly handles values of `n` from 0 to 4, but it lacks the implementation for calculating the factorial and returning the last digit for values of `n` less than 5, which should be addressed.

### Initial Assessment:
1. When `n >= 5`, the function correctly returns `0` since the last digit of any factorial from `5!` and onwards is `0`.
2. When `n < 5`, the function calculates the factorial and returns the last digit. This part seems to be working correctly for values from `0` to `4`.

### Edge Cases:
- For `n = 0`: `0! = 1`, so the last digit is `1`.
- For `n = 1`: `1! = 1`, so the last digit is `1`.
- For `n = 2`: `2! = 2`, so the last digit is `2`.
- For `n = 3`: `3! = 6`, so the last digit is `6`.
- For `n = 4`: `4! = 24`, so the last digit is `4`.

These cases appear to be handled correctly by the program.

### Output Hints Validation:
The output hints state that the function correctly handles values of `n` from `0` to `4`. The code does calculate the factorial and returns the last digit for these values correctly. The hints also mention that it lacks implementation for calculating the factorial for values of `n` less than `5`. However, the code does calculate the factorial for `n < 5` correctly.

The output hints include assertions for `func_1(21)` and `func_1(30)` which both evaluate to `0`, confirming that the function returns `0` for these cases, consistent with the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The code does follow the problem description for all potential cases. It handles all specified cases correctly, including edge cases. The output hints do not contradict the implementation and accurately describe the behavior of the code.

Correctness: **True**.
