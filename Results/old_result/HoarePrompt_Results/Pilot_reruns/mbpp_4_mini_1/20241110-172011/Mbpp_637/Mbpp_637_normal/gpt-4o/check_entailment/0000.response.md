The provided program `func_1` checks if the `cost_price` and `selling_price` are equal by returning `True` if they are the same, and `False` otherwise. This aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should determine whether there is no profit and no loss by checking if the two prices are equal.

Initially assessing the code, it seems to function as required for the specified condition. There are assertions provided that validate its functionality for three cases, including a case where the prices are equal (no profit, no loss) and two cases where they differ (indicating profit or loss).

However, I need to consider edge cases. The output hints indicate that the function does not perform additional checks for edge cases and works for any numerical input, including integers, floats, and negative values. It does not specify behavior when either `cost_price` or `selling_price` is negative. The problem description does not explicitly mention how to handle negative values, which could lead to uncertainty in defining "no profit, no loss" in those scenarios. For example, if `cost_price` is -100 and `selling_price` is -100, the function would return `True`, but it may not make sense in the context of profit and loss when dealing with negative values.

The output hints state that the function works for any numerical input and that the checks are limited to equality. This aligns with the code, which simply checks if the two values are equal without further validation.

Given these considerations, while the function works correctly for the provided assertions and meets the basic problem description, it lacks clarity on handling negative inputs. Since the description does not encompass all potential cases—specifically the treatment of negative values—the program does not fully align with the requirements.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program does not adequately handle cases where one or both prices are negative, which could lead to ambiguity regarding the concepts of profit and loss.
