To assess the given program, let's break down the problem description, the implementation, and the output hints.

**Problem description:** The function is supposed to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss, which means it should return `True` if the cost price is equal to the selling price.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(cost_price, selling_price):
    return cost_price == selling_price
```

This function checks if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price` and returns `True` if they are equal, otherwise it returns `False`. This matches the problem description accurately, as it directly checks for equality.

**Output hints:** The hints state that the function accepts two numerical parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns `True` if they are equal; otherwise, it returns `False`. It also notes that the function does not handle any edge cases related to the types of the inputs, assuming they are valid numerical values.

Now, let's evaluate if there could be any edge cases:

1. **Type Check:** The function assumes that both parameters are valid numerical values. However, if one or both of the inputs are not numerical (e.g., strings or None), the function will throw a TypeError instead of handling the case gracefully.

2. **NaN Values:** If either `cost_price` or `selling_price` is NaN (not a number), the comparison will return `False`, but it's uncertain what the expected behavior should be for such cases according to the problem description.

3. **Infinity:** If either input is infinity, the behavior of equality checks might not align with typical expectations.

The output hints agree with the basic functionality of the code, but they also highlight that the implementation does not handle edge cases related to input types. This could lead to scenarios where the function fails or produces misleading results based on invalid inputs.

Since the function does not explicitly handle these edge cases and assumes all inputs are valid numerical values, it does not completely fulfill the requirements of the problem description. 

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**. 

The implementation does not handle cases where the inputs could be non-numerical or special numerical values (like NaN or infinity), which may lead to incorrect behavior or errors.
