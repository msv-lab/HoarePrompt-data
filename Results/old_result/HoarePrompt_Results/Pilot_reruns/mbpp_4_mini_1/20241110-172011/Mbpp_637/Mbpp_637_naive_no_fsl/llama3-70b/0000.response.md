Correctness: **True**

The program correctly checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price, which is the condition for having no profit and no loss. If `cost_price` and `selling_price` are equal, it accurately returns `True`, indicating no profit and no loss. If they are not equal, it returns `False`, which is also correct as it indicates there is either a profit or a loss. 

There are no edge cases or potential inputs where the logic fails based on the problem description. Therefore, the function works as intended for all possible inputs.
