Correctness: **False**

The program is intended to check whether the given `cost_price` and `selling_price` indicate no profit and no loss, which is the case when they are equal (i.e., `cost_price == selling_price`). However, the annotations reveal that the function only checks for the equality of these two numerical values and does not account for potential edge cases such as data types or invalid inputs. 

For example, if `cost_price` is a string (e.g., "100") and `selling_price` is a number (e.g., 100), the function would return `False`, but it does not handle this case properly by providing a clear message or handling the type error. This implies that the function may not work correctly in scenarios where the inputs are not strictly numerical values.

Moreover, the problem description does not specify what should happen if the inputs are not valid numerical values. Therefore, since the function does not handle all potential cases as described, it is considered incorrect. The lack of handling for different data types and invalid inputs means that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
