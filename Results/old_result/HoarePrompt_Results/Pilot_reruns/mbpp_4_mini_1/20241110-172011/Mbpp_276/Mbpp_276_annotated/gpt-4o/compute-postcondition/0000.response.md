The variable `volume` is assigned the value calculated using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. The values of `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers, but their specific values are unknown. Therefore, the output state reflects that `volume` is calculated based on the formula involving `radius` and `height`.

Output State: **`radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers; `volume` is calculated as math.pi * radius ** 2 * height**
