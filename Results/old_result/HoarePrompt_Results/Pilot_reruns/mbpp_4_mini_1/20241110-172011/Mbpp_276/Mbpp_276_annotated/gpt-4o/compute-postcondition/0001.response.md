The function returns `volume`, which is calculated as `math.pi * radius`. The value of `volume` depends on the value of `radius`, and since `radius` is a non-negative number, `volume` will also be non-negative. The return statement does not change the state of `radius` or `height`. Therefore, the output state is `radius` is a non-negative number, `height` is a non-negative number, and the function returns `volume` calculated as `math.pi * radius`.

Output State: **`radius` is a non-negative number, `height` is a non-negative number, and the function returns `volume` calculated as `math.pi * radius`**
