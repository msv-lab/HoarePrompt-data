Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative real numbers, `radius` and `height`, and calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `volume = math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. It returns this calculated volume. However, the function does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` is negative; it assumes both inputs are valid non-negative values. **
