To assess the correctness of the program, let's break it down step by step.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that takes in the radius and height of a cylinder and returns the volume.

### Provided Program
```python
import math
def func_1(radius, height):
    volume = math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    return volume
```

### Output Hints
The function accepts two non-negative real numbers, `radius` and `height`, and calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `volume = math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`.

### Initial Assessment of Code
1. The formula used in the function `func_1` accurately calculates the volume of a cylinder based on the given radius and height.
2. The function does not include any checks for non-negative values of `radius` and `height`, which are explicitly mentioned in the problem description.

### Edge Cases
- **Negative Values**: If either `radius` or `height` is negative, the volume calculation would not make sense as volume cannot be negative. The function currently does not handle this case and would produce a mathematically incorrect output (e.g., a negative volume).
- **Zero Values**: If either `radius` or `height` is zero, the volume should be `0`, which the current implementation would handle correctly, but it does not explicitly acknowledge this case.

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints state that the function accepts two non-negative real numbers. Since the function does not enforce this condition, the hints agree with the description but do not point out the lack of validation in the code.

### Conclusion
The program does not handle the case where negative values for `radius` or `height` are provided, which makes it incorrect as per the problem requirements. Since the function lacks necessary validation and could produce incorrect results for negative inputs, it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
