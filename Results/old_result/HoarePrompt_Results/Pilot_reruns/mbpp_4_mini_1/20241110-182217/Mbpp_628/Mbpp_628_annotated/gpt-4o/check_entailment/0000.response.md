Correctness: **True**

The provided code correctly implements the requirement specified in the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an input string and replaces all spaces with '%20', which is exactly what is requested. 

The code annotations clarify that the function handles any string containing spaces and will return the original string if no spaces are found, which aligns with the problem description. The mention of edge cases such as empty strings or strings without spaces indicates that while these are not explicitly handled, they do not violate the requirements; they simply return the input as is.

In summary, since the function behaves as expected for all potential cases outlined in the problem description, including strings with spaces, without spaces, and empty strings, there are no cases where it fails to meet the requirements. Thus, I conclude that the program is correct.
