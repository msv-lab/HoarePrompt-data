Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The use of the `replace` method effectively handles all occurrences of spaces, regardless of the number of spaces or their positions in the string. 

Here are a few test cases to demonstrate that the program works as expected:

1. Input: `"Hello World"` → Output: `"Hello%20World"`
2. Input: `"   Leading and trailing spaces   "` → Output: `"%20%20%20Leading%20and%20trailing%20spaces%20%20%20"`
3. Input: `"NoSpaces"` → Output: `"NoSpaces"`
4. Input: `"Multiple    spaces"` → Output: `"Multiple%20%20%20%20spaces"`

In all cases, the program successfully replaces spaces with '%20', confirming that it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description for every potential case. Therefore, the program is correct.
