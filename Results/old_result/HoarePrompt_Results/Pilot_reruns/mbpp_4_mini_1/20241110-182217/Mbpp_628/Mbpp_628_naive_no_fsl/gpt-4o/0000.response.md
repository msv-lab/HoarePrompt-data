Correctness: **True**

The program correctly replaces all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The built-in `replace` method is used appropriately, and the assertions provided test various cases, all of which pass successfully. 

The function handles:
- Multiple spaces (e.g., 'My  Name' would become 'My%20%20Name').
- Leading and trailing spaces (e.g., ' My Name ' would become '%20My%20Name%20').
- Strings without spaces (e.g., 'HelloWorld' would remain 'HelloWorld').

Since I cannot identify a potential case where the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the implementation is correct.
