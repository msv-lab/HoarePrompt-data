The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists containing elements of any type. After executing the function body, it returns a sorted list of elements that are unique to each list, meaning elements that are present in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a sorted list of elements that are unique to each list. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters list1 and list2, both are lists of any type, and returns a sorted list of elements that are unique to each list.**
