The function returns `result_list`, which is sorted based on the indices of the concatenated `list1 + list2`. The initial states of `list1`, `set1`, `set2`, `diff_elements`, and `result_list` do not change with the return statement. Therefore, the output state is `list1` is a list that can contain any type of elements; `set1` is a set derived from `list1`, containing unique elements; `set2` is a set derived from `list2`; `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2`; and the function returns `result_list`.

Output State: **`list1` is a list that can contain any type of elements; `set1` is a set derived from `list1`, containing unique elements; `set2` is a set derived from `list2`; `diff_elements` is the symmetric difference of `set1` and `set2`; and the function returns `result_list`**
