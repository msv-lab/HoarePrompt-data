Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements. If `item` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the result of `func_1(item)` where `item` is the second element of `nested_list`. If `item` is not a list, `flat_list` is extended with `item`, which is the second element of `nested_list`. In both cases, `flat_list` will contain either the processed elements of `item` if it was a list or the second element of `nested_list` directly.***
