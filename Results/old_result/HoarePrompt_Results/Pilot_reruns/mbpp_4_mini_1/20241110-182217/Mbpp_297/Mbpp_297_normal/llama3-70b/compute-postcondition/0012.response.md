Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 elements, `element` is the third element of `nested_list`, and if `element` is a list, then `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(element)`. If `element` is not a list, then `flat_list` includes the third element of `nested_list`. Thus, `flat_list` will either contain the result of flattening `element` if it is a list or it will include `element` itself if it is not.***
