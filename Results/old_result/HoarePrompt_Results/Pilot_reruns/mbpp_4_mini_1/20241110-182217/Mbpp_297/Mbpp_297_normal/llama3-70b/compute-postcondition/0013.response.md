According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `nested_list`. If `nested_list` has at least 4 elements, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` contains at least 3 elements, and `element` is the third element of `nested_list`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least 4 elements, and `element` must be the fourth element of `nested_list`.

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 4 elements, `element` is the fourth element of `nested_list`, `flat_list` is updated accordingly**
