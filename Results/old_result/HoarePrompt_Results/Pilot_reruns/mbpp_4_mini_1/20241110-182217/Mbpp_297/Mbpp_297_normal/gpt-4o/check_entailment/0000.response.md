The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to flatten a nested list structure, which aligns with the problem description. The function iterates through each item in the `nested_list`, checking if the item is a list. If it is, it recursively calls `func_1` to flatten that sublist and extends the `flat_list` with the result. If the item is not a list, it simply appends the item to `flat_list`.

Hereâ€™s the assessment based solely on the code and the problem description:

1. **Correct Functionality**: The function correctly flattens nested lists, as it recursively processes any lists found within the main list. It also correctly handles non-list elements by adding them to the result.
2. **Empty List Handling**: If an empty list is provided, the function returns an empty list, which is also in accordance with the problem description.
3. **No Modifications to Original List**: The function does not modify the original `nested_list`, which aligns with the description.

Next, I will consider the output hints provided:

The output hints indicate that the function should accept a list that can contain integers, non-list elements, or nested lists, and return a flattened list of all non-list elements. It also mentions that if the input list is empty, the function should return an empty list.

Upon examining the output hints, they seem to agree with the code's functionality. The hints do not mention any edge cases that the code would not handle correctly. The function appears to correctly implement the requirements and expected behavior outlined in the problem description.

However, I need to consider edge cases:
- If `nested_list` contains non-list elements other than integers (like strings or dictionaries), the function will still append them to the flattened list. This behavior is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description but is a valid implementation. 
- The hints do not specify if the function should only handle integers or if other types are acceptable, which might create ambiguity. However, since the description states that it "handles any type of element," this should be fine.

Since I cannot find an example where the function does not work as expected based on the problem description and output hints, and all examples appear to validate the function correctly, I conclude that the function adheres to the problem description for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**. 

The function correctly flattens nested lists, handles empty lists appropriately, and does not modify the original list structure, satisfying all the conditions in the problem description.
