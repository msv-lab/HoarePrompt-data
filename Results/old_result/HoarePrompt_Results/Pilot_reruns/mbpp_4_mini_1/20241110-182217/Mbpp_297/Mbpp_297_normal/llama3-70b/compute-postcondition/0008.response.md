Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, `element` is the second element of `nested_list`, and if `element` is a list, then `flat_list` is extended by the result of `func_1(element)`. Otherwise, `flat_list` includes the second element of `nested_list`. This covers the case where `element` could be a nested list or a single value.***
