According to the code, the loop iterates over `nested_list`. For the loop to execute one more time, `nested_list` must have at least one more element after the current `element`. Since `nested_list` currently has at least 1 element and we are processing the first element, we need to adjust the state such that `nested_list` contains at least 2 elements. 

Therefore, the state needs to reflect that there is at least one additional element in `nested_list` and that we are now prepared to process the second element in the next iteration. 

State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 2 elements, element is the second element of `nested_list`**
