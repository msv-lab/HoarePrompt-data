Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem description, which is to flatten a nested list structure. 

1. The function `func_1` takes a list `nested_list` that can contain integers, other lists, or a mix of both. The recursive approach used in the code allows it to traverse through each element of the list.
2. If an element is itself a list, the function calls itself recursively to flatten that sublist. If the element is not a list (i.e., it is an integer or some other non-list type), it appends that element directly to the `flat_list`.
3. The annotations describe the state of the program accurately, stating that `flat_list` will contain all non-list elements from `nested_list`, along with any elements from nested lists processed by `func_1`. This is consistent with the problem description.
4. The function also correctly handles the case where `nested_list` is empty, returning an empty list, which aligns with the expected behavior described in the problem.

Since I could not identify any edge cases or scenarios where the function would fail to meet the requirements of the problem description, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases. Thus, I conclude that the function is correctly implemented.
