The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nested_list`. `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a mix of both. After executing the function body, it returns `flat_list`, which contains all non-list elements from `nested_list` as well as any elements from nested lists processed by `func_1`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `nested_list` and return a flattened list `flat_list` that includes all non-list elements and elements from any nested lists. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a list that can contain integers, other lists, or a mix of both. It returns a flattened list containing all non-list elements and elements from nested lists processed by the function.**
