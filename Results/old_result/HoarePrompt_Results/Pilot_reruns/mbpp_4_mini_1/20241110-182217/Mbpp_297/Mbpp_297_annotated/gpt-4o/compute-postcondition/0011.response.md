The code appends the value of `item` to the `flat_list`. Since `item` is defined as the third item in `nested_list`, it will take the value of that specific element. The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged, and we only affect the `flat_list` by adding a new element to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the list, and `flat_list` now includes `item`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 3 items, `item` is the third item in the list, and `flat_list` now includes `item`**
