The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its previous value of 2 to 3. The other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `count` is 3, and `elem` is the second element in `tup`.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `count` is 3, and `elem` is the second element in `tup`**
