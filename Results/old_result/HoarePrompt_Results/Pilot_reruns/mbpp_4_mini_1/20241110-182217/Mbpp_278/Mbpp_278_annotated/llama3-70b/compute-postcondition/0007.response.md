The function returns the index of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. The variable `elem` is the third element of `tup`, so the index returned will be 2 (since indexing starts at 0). The return statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is `tup` is a tuple with at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element of `tup`, and the function returns 2.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element of `tup`, and the function returns 2**.
