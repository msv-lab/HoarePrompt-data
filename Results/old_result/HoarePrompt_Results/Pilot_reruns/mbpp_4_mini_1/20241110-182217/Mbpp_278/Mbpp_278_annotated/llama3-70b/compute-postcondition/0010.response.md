Output State: **If `tup` is a tuple with at least one element, the loop iterates through the elements, returning the index of the first tuple element found. If the first element is a tuple, the function returns 0. If the second element is a tuple, it returns 1, and if the third element is a tuple, it returns 2. If `tup` does not contain any tuples, the loop completes without returning a value. If `tup` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function implicitly returns None, indicating no tuple was found.**
