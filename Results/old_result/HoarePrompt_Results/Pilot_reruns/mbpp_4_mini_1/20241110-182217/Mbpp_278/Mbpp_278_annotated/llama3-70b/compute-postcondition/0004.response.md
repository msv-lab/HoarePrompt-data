The function returns the index of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. Since `elem` is defined as the second element of `tup`, the index of `elem` will be `1` (as indexing starts at 0). The return statement does not change the state of the existing variables. Therefore, the output state is `tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element of `tup`, and the function returns 1.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element of `tup`, and the function returns 1**
