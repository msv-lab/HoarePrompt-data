Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple containing at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element of `tup`. If `elem` is itself a tuple, the function returns 0, indicating that the first element `elem` is found at index 0 of `tup`. If `elem` is not a tuple, there is no return value from the function.***
