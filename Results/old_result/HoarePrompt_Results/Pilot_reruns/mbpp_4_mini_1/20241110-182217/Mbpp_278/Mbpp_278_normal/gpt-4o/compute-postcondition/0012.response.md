The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 4, so after execution, `count` becomes 5. The values of `tup` and `elem` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `tup` is a tuple containing at least 4 elements, `elem` is the third element in `tup`, and `count` is 5.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least 4 elements, `elem` is the third element in `tup`, and `count` is 5**
