`first_index` is assigned the value of `s.find(ch)`, which returns the lowest index of the substring `ch` in the string `s`. If `ch` is not found in `s`, it returns -1. The values of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, and `first_index` is either the index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, and `first_index` is either the index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found in `s**.
