The code assigns `last_index` the value of `s.rfind(ch)`, which finds the last occurrence of the character `ch` in the string `s`. If `ch` is found, `last_index` will be the index of the last occurrence; if not found, it would be -1. The state of `s`, `ch`, and `first_index` remains unchanged. 

The output state is: `s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of `ch` in `s` or -1, and `last_index` is the last index of `ch` in `s`, or -1 if `ch` is not found.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is either the index of `ch` in `s` or -1, `last_index` is the last index of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found**
