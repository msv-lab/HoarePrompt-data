Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `c` is a character that may or may not be present in `s`, `first_occ` is either the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1, and `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not present. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not -1, the function returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed. If `first_occ` is -1 or `last_occ` is -1`, the function returns the original string `s` unchanged.***
