The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `ch`. The parameter `s` is a string, and `ch` is a single character string. Based on the output conditions provided:

- In Case 1, if `ch` is not found in `s` (indicated by `first_index` being -1) or if `ch` appears only once (indicated by `first_index` and `last_index` being equal), the function returns `s` without any changes.
- In Case 2, similar conditions apply where if `ch` is not found or appears only once, the function again returns `s` without any changes.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character string `ch`, and return `s` unchanged if `ch` is not present in `s` or appears only once.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter `s` (a string) and `ch` (a single character string). It returns `s` unchanged if `ch` is not present in `s` or appears only once.**
