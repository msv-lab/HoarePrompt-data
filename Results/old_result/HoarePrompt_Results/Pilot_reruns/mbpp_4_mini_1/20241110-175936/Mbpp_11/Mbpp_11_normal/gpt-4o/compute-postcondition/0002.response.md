The function returns `s`, which is a string. The return statement does not change the state of any other variables. Therefore, the output state is `s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a single character string, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, and the function returns `s`**
