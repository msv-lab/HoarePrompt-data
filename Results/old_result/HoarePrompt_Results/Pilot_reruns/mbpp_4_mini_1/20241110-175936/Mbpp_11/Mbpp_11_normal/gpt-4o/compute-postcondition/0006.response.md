Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` and a single character string `ch`. It returns `s` unchanged if `ch` does not occur in `s` or if it occurs only once. If `ch` occurs at least twice in `s`, it removes the first and last occurrences of `ch` from `s` and returns the modified string.**
