Postcondition: ***`s` is a string; `c` is a single character; `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found; `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if not found. If both `first_occ` and `last_occ` are not -1, the function returns the string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed. If either `first_occ` or `last_occ` is -1, indicating that `c` is not found in `s`, the function returns `s` unchanged. This ensures that if `c` is not present in `s`, the original string is preserved.***
