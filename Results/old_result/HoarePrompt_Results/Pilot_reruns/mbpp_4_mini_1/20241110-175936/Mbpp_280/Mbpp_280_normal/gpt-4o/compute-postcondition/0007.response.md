The function returns a tuple containing `True` and the value of `index`. The value of `index` is 2. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state reflects the current values of `arr`, `index`, and `value`. 

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 3 elements, `index` is 2, `value` is the third element of `arr`, and the function returns True, 2**.
