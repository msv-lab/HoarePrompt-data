To evaluate the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the code and the problem description carefully.

### Problem Description
The task is to write a function that takes in an array and an element and returns a tuple containing:
1. A boolean indicating if the element is in the array.
2. The index position of the element if found, or -1 if the element is not found.

### Program Code
```python
def func_1(arr, element):
    for (index, value) in enumerate(arr):
        if value == element:
            return (True, index)
    return (False, -1)
```

### Output Hints
The function:
- Accepts a list `arr` and an `element`.
- Checks if the `element` is present in `arr`.
- Returns a tuple (True, index) if found, where `index` is the index of the matching element.
- Returns (False, -1) if the `element` is not found, including when `arr` is empty.

### Initial Assessment
1. The function iterates through the array using `enumerate`, checking if the current value matches the `element`.
2. If a match is found, it returns (True, index).
3. If the loop completes without finding a match, it returns (False, -1).

### Edge Cases
- If the input array `arr` is empty, the function should correctly return (False, -1).
- If the `element` is not present in the array, it should also return (False, -1).

Based on the provided code, the function correctly handles these cases as it will iterate through an empty array and directly return (False, -1).

### Output Hints Validation
The output hints state:
- The function returns a tuple (True, index) if the element is found, and (False, -1) otherwise, including for an empty array. 

These hints align perfectly with the function's logic as implemented in the code.

### Conclusion
Since the program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description and handles all potential edge cases as confirmed by the output hints, I conclude that the program is correct.

Correctness: **True**. 

The code correctly returns whether the element is in the array and its index or -1 if not found, and it handles empty lists appropriately.
