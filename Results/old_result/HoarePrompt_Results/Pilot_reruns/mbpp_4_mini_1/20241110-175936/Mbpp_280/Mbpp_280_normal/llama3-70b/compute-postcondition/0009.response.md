According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list and the variable `i`. The loop iterates over the elements of `arr`, and the loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `arr`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, which means the loop has processed the first three elements of `arr`. Since `arr` has at least 3 elements, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3, and `x` should be updated to the fourth element in `arr`.

Therefore, the required adjustments are:
- `i` should be changed to 3.
- `x` should be changed to the fourth element in `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, and `x` is the fourth element in `arr`**.
