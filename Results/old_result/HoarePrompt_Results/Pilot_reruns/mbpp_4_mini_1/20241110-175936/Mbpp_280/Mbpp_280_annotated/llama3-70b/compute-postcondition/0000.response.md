According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr` list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be the index of the last element, and `x` will be that last element. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 element, and initially, `i` should be 0, with `x` being the first element in the list.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element in the list**
