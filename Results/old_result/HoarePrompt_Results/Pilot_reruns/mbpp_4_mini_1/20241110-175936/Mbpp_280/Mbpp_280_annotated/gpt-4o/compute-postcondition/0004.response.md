The function returns a tuple containing `True` and `index`. The value of `index` is given as 1, and `arr` is a list with at least one element. The return statement does not change the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state is `arr` is a list of elements with at least one element, `index` is 1, `value` is the second element in `arr`, and the function returns `(True, 1)`.

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least one element, `index` is 1, `value` is the second element in `arr`, and the function returns (True, 1)**
