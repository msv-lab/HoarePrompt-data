According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `arr`. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `index` should begin at 0, and `value` should be the first element in the list `arr`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `arr` must have at least 1 element, `index` is 0, and `value` is the first element of `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `index` is 0, `value` is the first element in `arr`**
