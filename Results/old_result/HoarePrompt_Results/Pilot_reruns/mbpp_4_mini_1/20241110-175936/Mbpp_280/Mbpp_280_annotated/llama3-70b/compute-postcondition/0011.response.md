The `return` statement indicates that the function will return two values: `False` and `-1`. The previous state indicates that `arr` is a list with at least one element, and `elem` is equal to one of the elements in `arr`, but since the specific return statement is executed, it implies that the element was not found in the previous loop execution. This means the state of `arr` remains unchanged, and the return statement provides the output values.

Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least one element; the function returns False and -1**
