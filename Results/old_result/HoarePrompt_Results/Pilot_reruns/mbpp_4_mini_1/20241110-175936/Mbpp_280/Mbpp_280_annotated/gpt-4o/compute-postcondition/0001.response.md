The function returns a tuple containing `True` and the current value of `index`, which is 0. The value of `arr` is not affected, and `value` holds the first element of `arr`, but those values do not change. The return statement does not alter the state of the variables; it only provides an output. Therefore, the output state is: `arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `index` is 0, `value` is the first element in `arr`, and the function returns (True, 0).

Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 1 element, `index` is 0, `value` is the first element in `arr`, and the function returns (True, 0)**
