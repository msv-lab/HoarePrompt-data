The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `elem`, which is an element that can be compared for equality with elements in `arr`. 

In the execution of the function:

- **Case 1**: If `arr` is a non-empty list and `elem` is equal to one of the elements in `arr`, the function returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `elem`.
- If `arr` is an empty list, the function does not execute the loop and has no return value.
- If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function executes until the end of the list without returning any value, leaving the state unchanged.

- **Case 2**: If `arr` is a non-empty list and `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function returns `False` and -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an element `elem`, returning the index of the first occurrence of `elem` if found, or returning `False` and -1 if `elem` is not present in the list. If `arr` is empty, there is no return value. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and an element `elem`. It returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `elem` if found; if `elem` is not found, it returns `False` and -1. If `arr` is empty, there is no return value.**
