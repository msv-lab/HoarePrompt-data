Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. It takes an array and an element as inputs, and it returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array, along with the index of the element if found, or -1 if the element is not present.

The logic inside the function `func_1` uses a for loop to enumerate over the array. It checks if the current value matches the element. If it finds a match, it returns `(True, index)` where `index` is the position of the element. If the loop completes without finding the element, it returns `(False, -1)`.

The assertions provided test the function with various cases, and they all yield the expected results. 

Additionally, I considered edge cases, such as:
- An empty array, which would return `(False, -1)`.
- An element not present in the array, which would also return `(False, -1)`.
- Duplicate elements, where it correctly returns the index of the first occurrence.

Since I cannot find any examples where the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description, I conclude that the program is correct.
