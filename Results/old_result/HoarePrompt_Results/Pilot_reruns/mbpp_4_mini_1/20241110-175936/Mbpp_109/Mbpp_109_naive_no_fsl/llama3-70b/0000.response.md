To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to evaluate whether it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the number of numbers with an odd value when rotating a binary string the given number of times.

### Program Analysis:
The code provided is as follows:
```python
def func_1(s, n):
    s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)
    count = 0
    for i in range(n):
        temp = s[i:i + len(s)]
        count += temp.count('1') % 2
    return count
```

### Breakdown of the Code:
1. The string `s` is duplicated enough times to ensure that we can access `n` rotations of the string.
2. A loop iterates `n` times.
3. In each iteration, a substring `temp` of length `len(s)` is extracted starting from index `i`.
4. The program counts the number of '1's in `temp` and checks if that count is odd (using `count('1') % 2`).
5. If the count of '1's is odd, it increments the `count`.
6. Finally, the function returns the total `count`.

### Testing for Edge Cases:
1. **Odd and Even Counts:**
   - If `s` contains all '0's, the result should be `0` since there are no '1's.
   - If `s` contains all '1's, the result should equal the number of rotations `n` since every rotation will have an odd count of '1's.
   - If `s` is a single '1' and `n` is 5, the result should be `5` since all rotations will yield `1`.
   - If `s` is '101' and `n` is 3, the rotations would produce '101', '011', and '110', which have odd counts: 2, 2, and 2 respectively, resulting in `0`.

2. **Values of `n` less than `len(s)`:**
   - For a binary string like `s = '110'` and `n = 2`, the rotations would yield '11', '10', leading to counts of 2 and 1, resulting in a total of `1`.

3. **String Length vs Rotation Count:**
   - If `n` is significantly larger than `len(s)`, the function should still work correctly.

### Potential Case for Incorrectness:
After analyzing various scenarios, we note that the logic for counting odd occurrences is flawed. Specifically, when the string `s` is a binary string with a combination of '0's and '1's, and if the substring length does not match the intended rotation, the count may not reflect the actual odd counts correctly.

For instance, if `s = "100"` and `n = 5`, the function would incorrectly interpret the rotations due to how `temp` is generated and counted. The expected odd counts might not match due to overlapping counts.

### Conclusion:
The program does not satisfy the requirements of the problem in all cases. The logic fails in scenarios where the rotation count exceeds the effective counting of '1's.

Correctness: **False**
