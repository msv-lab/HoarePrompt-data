According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_rotations`. If `num_rotations` is at least 1, the loop can execute. The initial state indicates that `count` is 0, but this does not impact the execution of the loop. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `num_rotations` must be greater than 0. The loop variable (which is unused in the loop body) is typically initialized with a value for each iteration, but since it is not used, it does not need to be adjusted. 

State: **`binary_str` is a string consisting of '0' and '1', `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0**
