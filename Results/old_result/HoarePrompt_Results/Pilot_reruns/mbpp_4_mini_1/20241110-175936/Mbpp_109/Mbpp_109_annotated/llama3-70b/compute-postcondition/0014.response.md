The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `n`. The parameter `s` is a binary string consisting of characters '0' and '1', and the parameter `n` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, if `n` is 0, the function returns `count`, which remains 0. Otherwise, `count` is the sum of the counts of '1's in each segment of `s` of length `len(s)` taken from indices `0` to `n-1`, modulo 2. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and return the count of '1's in specified segments of `s`, considering the modulo 2 of that count, while returning 0 if `n` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `s` (a binary string) and `n` (a non-negative integer), and returns the count of '1's in specified segments of `s` modulo 2, returning 0 if `n` is 0.**
