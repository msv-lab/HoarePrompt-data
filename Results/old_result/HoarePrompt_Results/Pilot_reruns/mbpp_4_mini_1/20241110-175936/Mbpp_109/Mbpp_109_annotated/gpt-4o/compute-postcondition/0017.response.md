Output State: **`binary_str` is the result of `num_rotations` left rotations of the original string, `count` is the number of times the integer representation of `binary_str` is odd after each rotation, and `num_rotations` is the non-negative integer indicating how many rotations were attempted. If `num_rotations` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `binary_str` remains unchanged while `count` remains 0. If `binary_str` is empty, the loop will execute `num_rotations` times, but since there are no characters to rotate, `binary_str` will remain empty and `count` will also stay 0.**
