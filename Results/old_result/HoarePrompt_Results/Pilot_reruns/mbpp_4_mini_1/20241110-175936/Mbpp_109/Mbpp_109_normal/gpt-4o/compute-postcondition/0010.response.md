Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is the last character of the original `binary_str` concatenated with the rest, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, and `count` is 2 if the integer representation of `binary_str` in base 2 is odd (i.e., `integer_value % 2 == 1`). If `integer_value` is even, `count` remains 1.***
