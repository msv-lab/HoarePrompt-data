Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is a rotated string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0 initially, and `integer_value` is the integer representation of `binary_str` in base 2. If `integer_value` is odd, `count` is increased by 1, resulting in `count` being 1. If `integer_value` is even, `count` remains 0.***
