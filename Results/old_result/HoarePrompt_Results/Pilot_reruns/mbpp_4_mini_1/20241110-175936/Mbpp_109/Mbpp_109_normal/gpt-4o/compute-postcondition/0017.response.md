Output State: **`count` is the number of times the integer representation of `binary_str` in base 2 is odd after `num_rotations` rotations. If `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `binary_str` will be the result of rotating the original string `num_rotations` times. If `num_rotations` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0, with `binary_str` unchanged.**
