`temp` is assigned the value of the substring of `s` starting from index `i` (which is 1) up to the length of `s`. Therefore, `temp` will contain the substring from index 1 to the end of `s`, effectively removing the first character of `s`. The values of `s`, `n`, `count`, and `i` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`s` is a binary string consisting of '0's and '1's, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 1, `temp` is the substring of `s` from index 1 to the end of `s`**
