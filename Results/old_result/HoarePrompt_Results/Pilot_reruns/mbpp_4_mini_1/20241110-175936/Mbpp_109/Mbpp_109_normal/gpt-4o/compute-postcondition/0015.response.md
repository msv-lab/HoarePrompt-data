Postcondition: ***`binary_str` is the last character of the original `binary_str` concatenated with the rest, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, and `count` is 2 if the integer representation of `binary_str` in base 2 is even, or 3 if it is odd, thus updating `count` accordingly. The `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str` in base 2.***
