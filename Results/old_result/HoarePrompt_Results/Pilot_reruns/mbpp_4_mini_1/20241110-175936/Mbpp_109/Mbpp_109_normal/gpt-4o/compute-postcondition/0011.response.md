According to the code, the loop will execute `num_rotations` times. At the end of the last iteration, `num_rotations` is greater than 1, which indicates that there is at least 2 rotations remaining for the loop to execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `num_rotations`, which will decrease by 1.

Since `num_rotations` is greater than 1, we can adjust it to be greater than or equal to 1 to ensure that the loop can execute again. The other states (`binary_str`, `count`) do not need to be adjusted, as they do not affect the condition for the loop to run again.

State: **`binary_str` is the last character of the original `binary_str` concatenated with the rest, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, and `count` is 2 if the integer representation of `binary_str` in base 2 is odd (i.e., `integer_value % 2 == 1). If `integer_value` is even, `count` remains 1.**
