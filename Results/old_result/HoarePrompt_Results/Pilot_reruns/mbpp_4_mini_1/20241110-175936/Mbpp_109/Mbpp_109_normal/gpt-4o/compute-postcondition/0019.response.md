The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. The parameter `binary_str` is a string consisting of '0's and '1's, while `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, it calculates `count`, which is the number of times the integer representation of `binary_str` in base 2 is odd after `num_rotations` rotations. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a string `binary_str` of binary digits and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`, and return the count of odd integers represented by `binary_str` after the specified number of rotations. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a string binary_str consisting of '0's and '1's and a non-negative integer num_rotations, returning the count of odd integers represented by binary_str after num_rotations rotations.**
