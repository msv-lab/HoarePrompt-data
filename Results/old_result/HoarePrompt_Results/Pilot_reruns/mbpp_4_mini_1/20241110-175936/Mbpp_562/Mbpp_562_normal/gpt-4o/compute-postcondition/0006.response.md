Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists containing at least two sublists, and `max_length` remains unchanged unless the length of `sublist` exceeds `max_length`, in which case `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`. In situations where the length of `sublist` is less than or equal to `max_length`, `max_length` remains the same.***
