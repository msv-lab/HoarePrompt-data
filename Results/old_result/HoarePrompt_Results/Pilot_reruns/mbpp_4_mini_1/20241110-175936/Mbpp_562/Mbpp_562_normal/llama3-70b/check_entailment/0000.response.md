To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python function against the problem description and output hints, we proceed as follows:

### Problem Description:
The problem asks for a function that finds the length of the longest sublists within a list of lists.

### Program:
```python
def func_1(lists):
    return max((len(sublist) for sublist in lists))
```

### Output Hints:
The hints indicate that the function accepts a list of lists and returns the maximum length of the sublists. However, it also notes that if `lists` is empty, the code will raise a `ValueError` because `max()` cannot operate on an empty iterable.

### Initial Assessment:
The program appears to correctly calculate the maximum length of the sublists when the `lists` input is non-empty. However, it does not handle the case where `lists` is empty, which is a significant edge case as per the problem description. If `lists` is empty, the function will throw an error, which does not align with the expected behavior of simply returning a length.

### Verification Against Output Hints:
The output hints clearly point out that the function will raise a `ValueError` when `lists` is empty. This confirms that the program fails to handle this edge case appropriately, hence not fulfilling the requirements of the problem description.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, specifically failing to account for empty input. Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program will throw an error when provided with an empty list of lists, which is a valid case that should be handled according to the problem description.
