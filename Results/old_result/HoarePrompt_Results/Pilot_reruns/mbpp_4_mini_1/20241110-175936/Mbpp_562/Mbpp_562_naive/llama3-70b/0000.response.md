Correctness: **False**.

The provided program does not handle the case when the input list `lists` is empty. If `lists` is empty, the expression `max((len(sublist) for sublist in lists))` will raise a `ValueError` because the `max()` function cannot operate on an empty sequence. 

For example, if the input is `func_1([])`, the function will throw an exception instead of returning a valid result. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
