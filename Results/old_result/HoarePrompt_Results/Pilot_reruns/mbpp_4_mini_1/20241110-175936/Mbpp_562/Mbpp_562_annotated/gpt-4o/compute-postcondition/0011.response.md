Output State: **`max_length` is the length of the longest sublist in `list_of_lists`. If `list_of_lists` is non-empty, the loop will execute for each sublist and update `max_length` accordingly. If `list_of_lists` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `max_length` remains 0. In this case, `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, and `max_length` is 0.**
