The value of `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`. Since `sublist` is the third sublist in `list_of_lists`, its length is determined by the contents of that specific sublist. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`, `list_of_lists` remains unchanged, and `sublist` is the third sublist in the list of lists.

Output State: **`max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`, `list_of_lists` remains unchanged, `sublist` is the third sublist in the list of lists.**
