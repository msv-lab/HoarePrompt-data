Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not handle division by zero. If any element in `list2` is zero, the program will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, which means the program does not fulfill the requirement to divide two lists element-wise for all potential cases. For example, if `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [1, 0, 3]`, the function will attempt to divide by zero for the second element, resulting in an error. Thus, the program is incorrect as it does not account for this scenario.
