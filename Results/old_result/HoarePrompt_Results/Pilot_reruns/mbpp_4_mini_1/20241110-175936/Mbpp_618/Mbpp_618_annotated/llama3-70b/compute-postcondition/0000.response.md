The code raises a `ValueError` with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'. This indicates that the program encountered a condition where `list1` and `list2` do not have the same length. Since the execution of this code does not change the state of `list1` or `list2`, the output state reflects the error condition.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` must have the same length, and a ValueError is raised with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'**
