The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers and have the same length. The function returns a list consisting of the results of dividing corresponding elements from `list1` by those from `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to take two lists of numbers of the same length and return a new list containing the results of element-wise division of `list1` by `list2`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, and returns a list of the results of dividing corresponding elements from list1 by those from list2.**
