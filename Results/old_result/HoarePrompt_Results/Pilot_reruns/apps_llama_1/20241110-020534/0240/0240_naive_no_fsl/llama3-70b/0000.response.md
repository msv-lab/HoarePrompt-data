Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all potential cases. The issue lies in the fact that the program does not consider the length of the string `s` when constructing the integer `n`. According to the problem description, the integer `k` (the number of digits in `n`) is appended to the right of the string `n`. However, the program does not take this into account when constructing the integer `n`.

For example, if the input is `s = "123456"` and `t = "123"`, the program will output `123123`, which is incorrect. The correct output should be `123456123`, because the length of the string `n` is 6, and the integer `k` should be appended to the right of `n`.

The program only checks if the characters in `t` are present in `s`, but it does not consider the length of `s` when constructing `n`. This is why the program is incorrect.
