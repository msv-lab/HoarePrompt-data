Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the substring is a prefix of the original number. In this case, the program should not remove the characters of the substring from the remaining characters, but instead, it should keep them as the prefix of the original number.

For example, if the input is "123456" and the substring is "123", the program should return "123456", but instead, it returns a different number.

To fix this issue, the program should check if the substring is a prefix of the original number and handle it separately. 

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:

Input
123456
123

Output
3456 (or any other number that is not "123456")

Expected Output
123456
