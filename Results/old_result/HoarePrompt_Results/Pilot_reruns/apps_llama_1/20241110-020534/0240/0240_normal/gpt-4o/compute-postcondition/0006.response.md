The `yield` statement produces a value, but it does not change the state of the variables. The value produced is the current value of `candidate`, which is the next permutation of `chars`.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars`, and the generator yields the value of `candidate`**
