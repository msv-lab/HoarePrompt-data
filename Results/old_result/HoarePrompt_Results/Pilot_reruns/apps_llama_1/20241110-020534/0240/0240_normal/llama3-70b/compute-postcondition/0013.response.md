Based on the initial state and the given code, here is the output state:

The code `n += t` appends the string `t` to the end of string `n`. Since `n` is a substring of `s` containing all the digits that are present in `t`, and `t` is appended to `n`, the resulting string `n` will contain all the digits that are present in `t` from `s`, followed by the entire string `t`. The values of `s` and `t_set` remain unchanged as they are not modified within the code. The value of `t` also remains unchanged as it is only used for appending and not modified.

Output State: **`s` remains unchanged, `t_set` remains unchanged, `t` remains unchanged, `n` is a substring of `s` containing all the digits that are present in `t`, followed by the entire string `t`.**
