Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits, `perm` is one of the permutations of `chars`, and `candidate` is a permutation of `chars`. The function yields the value of `candidate` if it is a valid number based on the given `sub`, otherwise it does not yield any value.***
