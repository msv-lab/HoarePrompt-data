Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits, contains all the digits of `t`, and has at least one more character after the first one, `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits of `t`. If the second character of `s` is in `t_set`, then `n` is a string containing the previous value of `n` concatenated with the second character of `s`; otherwise, `n` remains unchanged, either an empty string or containing the first character of `s` if it was set in the previous iteration.***
