Let's think step by step:

The code `n += c` appends the value of `c` to the string `n`. 

Initially, `n` is an empty string and `c` is the first character of `s`. 

After execution, `n` will be a string containing the first character of `s`, and the states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits and contains all the digits of `t`, `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits of `t`, `n` is a string containing the first character of `s`, `c` is the first character of `s`.

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits and contains all the digits of `t`, `t` is a non-empty string consisting only of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits of `t`, `n` is a string containing the first character of `s`, `c` is the first character of `s`.**
