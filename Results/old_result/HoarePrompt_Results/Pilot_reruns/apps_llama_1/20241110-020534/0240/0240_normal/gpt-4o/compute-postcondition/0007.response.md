Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, `sub` is a non-empty substring of a string consisting of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`, the generator yields the value of `candidate`; otherwise, the generator does not yield any value.***
