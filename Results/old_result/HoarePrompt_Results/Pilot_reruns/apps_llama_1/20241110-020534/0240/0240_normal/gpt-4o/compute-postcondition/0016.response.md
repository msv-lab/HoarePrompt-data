Based on the provided annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the function's functionality step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` (a string of digits) and `sub` (a substring of `s`).

Here's a summary of what the function does:

1. It calculates the difference in lengths between `s` and `sub` and stores it in `n_len`.
2. It creates two dictionaries, `s_counter` and `sub_counter`, to store the digit counts of `s` and `sub`, respectively.
3. It subtracts the digit counts of `sub` from `s_counter`, effectively removing the occurrences of `sub` from `s`.
4. It creates a string `remaining_chars` by repeating each character in `s_counter` by its corresponding count.
5. It generates a list of possible numbers using the `generate_possible_numbers` function, which is not shown in the provided code.
6. It finds the smallest possible number from the list and returns it.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If `sub` is not a substring of `s`, the function will still return a result, but it might not be the expected one.
* If `s` or `sub` is an empty string, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` or return incorrect results.
* The `generate_possible_numbers` function is not shown, so its behavior is unknown. It might not generate all possible numbers, or it might generate numbers that are not valid.
* The function does not check if the resulting number is valid (e.g., it does not contain leading zeros).

Considering these potential edge cases and missing logic, the functionality of the function can be summarized as:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string of digits `s` and a substring `sub`, removes the occurrences of `sub` from `s`, generates a list of possible numbers using the remaining characters, and returns the smallest possible number. However, it may return incorrect results or raise errors if `sub` is not a substring of `s`, or if `s` or `sub` is an empty string. Additionally, the function's behavior depends on the unknown `generate_possible_numbers` function. **
