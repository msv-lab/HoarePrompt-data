To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop statement and the given state.

The loop statement is `for c in s:`, which means the loop will iterate over each character `c` in the string `s`. 

Given that `s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character, we know that there are more characters to iterate over.

The states that need to be adjusted are:

- `s`: Since we have iterated over one character, `s` should now have at least 1 character fewer than before, but still be a non-empty string consisting of digits.
- `c`: Since we are iterating over the next character in `s`, `c` should be the next character in the string.
- The state of `t`, `t_set`, and `n` does not depend on the loop variable `c`, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits with at least 1 character fewer than before, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits present in `t`, `n` is either an empty string, the first character of `s` with one or more characters appended to it**
