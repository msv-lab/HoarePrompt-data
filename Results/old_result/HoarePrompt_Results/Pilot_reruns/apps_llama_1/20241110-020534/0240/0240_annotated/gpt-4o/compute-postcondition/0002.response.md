The `yield` statement produces a value, but does not change the state of the variables. The value produced is `candidate`, which is the string formed by joining all the characters in `perm`. The state of the variables remains the same.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string formed by joining all the characters in `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`.**
