The function accepts two non-empty strings `s` and `t` consisting of digits, and returns the integer value of the string formed by appending `t` to the digits in `s` that are also present in `t`. If `s` is empty, it returns the integer value of `t`. If `t` is empty, it raises a `ValueError`. If `s` or `t` contains non-digit characters, it raises a `ValueError`.
