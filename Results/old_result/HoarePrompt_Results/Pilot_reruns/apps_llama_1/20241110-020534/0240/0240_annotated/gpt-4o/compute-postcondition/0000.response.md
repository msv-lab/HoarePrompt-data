To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that must be met for the loop to run at least once.

According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The `permutations` function will generate all possible permutations of `chars`, and the loop will execute for each permutation.

For the loop to execute, `chars` must be a non-empty string, which is already given in the initial state. However, we need to ensure that there is at least one permutation of `chars` that contains the substring `sub`.

Since `sub` is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, we can conclude that `chars` must contain all the characters of `sub`. Additionally, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, which means it is one possible arrangement of the characters in `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`**
