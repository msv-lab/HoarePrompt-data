To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

The loop statement is `for perm in permutations(chars):`. This means the loop will iterate over all permutations of the string `chars`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we know:
- `chars` is a non-empty string of digits.
- `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`.
- `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`.
- `candidate` is the string formed by joining all the characters in the next permutation of the next permutation of `chars`.

For the loop to execute again, we need to consider what changes are necessary for `perm` to represent the next permutation of `chars` in the sequence of all permutations.

Since `perm` has already been used in the previous iteration, it needs to be updated to the next permutation in the sequence. However, the description of `perm` as "the next permutation of `chars`" does not directly imply a specific adjustment, because it's already representing a permutation. The critical point is that `perm` will naturally move to the next permutation in the sequence as the loop iterates.

The key insight is recognizing that the loop will automatically move to the next permutation of `chars` with each iteration due to the nature of the `for` loop and the `permutations` function. Thus, we don't need to explicitly adjust `perm` or `chars` in our state description to reflect this movement, as it's inherent in the loop's operation.

However, we do need to consider the state of `candidate` and its relationship to `perm`. Since `candidate` is derived from the next permutation of `perm` (which is itself a permutation of `chars`), and `perm` moves to the next permutation in the sequence, `candidate` would naturally be updated based on this new permutation. But since the loop body is omitted, and we're only considering the state at the start of the next iteration, we don't have explicit information on how `candidate` is updated in relation to the new `perm`. Given the information provided, we don't adjust `candidate` directly in our state description.

Therefore, the states that need adjustment for the loop to execute one more time are not explicitly stated in terms of changing `perm` or `candidate` but are implicitly handled by the loop's progression through the permutations of `chars`. However, since we are tasked with describing the state at the start of the next iteration and given the information provided, we acknowledge that `perm` moves to the next permutation in the sequence, but we don't have enough information to explicitly update `candidate` in our description. Thus, the description of the state focuses on the fact that the loop progresses through permutations without needing to explicitly update `candidate` in this context.

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a non-empty string of digits that is a substring of some permutation of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars` in the sequence of all permutations, and `candidate` is determined based on the next permutation of `chars`.**
