Based on the provided annotated code and return postconditions, I have analyzed the functionality of the function `func_1`.

The function accepts two parameters, `s` and `sub`, where `s` is a non-empty string of digits and `sub` is a non-empty substring of digits that can be formed by shuffling the digits of `s` and its length.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function's functionality:

1. It calculates the difference in lengths between `s` and `sub` and stores it in `n_len`.
2. It creates two dictionaries, `s_counter` and `sub_counter`, to count the occurrences of each digit in `s` and `sub`, respectively.
3. It subtracts the count of each digit in `sub` from the count of each digit in `s` and stores the result in `s_counter`.
4. It generates a string `remaining_chars` containing the remaining digits in `s` after removing the digits in `sub`.
5. It generates a list of possible numbers `possible_numbers` by combining the remaining characters in `s` with the characters in `sub`.
6. It finds the smallest number in `possible_numbers` and returns it.

However, upon closer inspection, I noticed that the code does not handle the case where `sub` is not a substring of `s`. In this case, the function will still return a smallest number, but it may not be a valid solution. Additionally, the code does not handle the case where `s` or `sub` contains non-digit characters.

Therefore, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters `s` and `sub`, where `s` is a non-empty string of digits and `sub` is a non-empty substring of digits. It returns the smallest possible number that can be generated from the remaining characters in `s` after removing the characters in `sub`, combined with the characters in `sub`. However, it does not guarantee a valid solution if `sub` is not a substring of `s`, and it does not handle non-digit characters in `s` or `sub`. **
