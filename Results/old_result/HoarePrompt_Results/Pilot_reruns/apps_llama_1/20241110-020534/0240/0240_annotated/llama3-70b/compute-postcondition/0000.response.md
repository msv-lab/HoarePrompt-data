Let's analyze the given code snippet.

The code `t_set = set(t)` creates a new set `t_set` containing the unique characters in the string `t`. Since `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, the set `t_set` will contain the unique digits present in `t`.

The initial state mentions that `t` is a substring of some string `n` that was formed by appending the number of digits in `n` to the right of `n`. However, this information is not directly relevant to the creation of the set `t_set`.

Considering the initial state, the output state will be:

Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, `t` is a non-empty string consisting of digits, and `t_set` is a set containing the unique digits present in `t`.**
