The function takes an integer input `n` from the user and prints its value rounded to the nearest multiple of 10, with the following rules: if `n` is a multiple of 10, it prints `n` as is; if the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest ten; otherwise, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10.
