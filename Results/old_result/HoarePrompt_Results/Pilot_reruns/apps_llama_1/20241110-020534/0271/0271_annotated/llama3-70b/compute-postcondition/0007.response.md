Based on the provided annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the functionality of the function.

The function `func` accepts no parameters and returns no value (it only prints output). It takes an integer input `n` from the user.

Here's a step-by-step breakdown of the function's behavior:

1. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function prints `n` as is.
2. If `n` is not a multiple of 10, the function checks the remainder of `n` divided by 10.
	* If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the function prints `n` truncated to the nearest ten (i.e., rounded down).
	* If the remainder is greater than 5, the function prints `n` rounded up to the nearest multiple of 10.

The annotations suggest that the function rounds `n` to the nearest multiple of 10, but the code actually implements a more specific behavior based on the remainder of `n` divided by 10.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function takes an integer input `n` from the user and prints its value rounded to the nearest multiple of 10, with the following rules: if `n` is a multiple of 10, it prints `n` as is; if the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest ten; otherwise, it rounds up to the nearest multiple of 10. **
