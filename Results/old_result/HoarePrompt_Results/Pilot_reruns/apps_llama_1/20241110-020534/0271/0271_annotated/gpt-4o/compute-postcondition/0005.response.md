The code `print(result)` prints the value of `result` to the console. The value of `result` depends on the initial values of `n` and `remainder`. 

If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is the difference between `n` and `remainder`, so `result` is `n - remainder`. 

If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is `n` plus a value between 1 and 5 (10 minus `remainder`), so `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`.

In both cases, the state of the variables `n` and `remainder` does not change. The function prints the value of `result` but does not return it.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `remainder` is an integer from 0 to 9, and the function prints the value of `result` which is either `n - remainder` or `n + (10 - remainder)`.**
