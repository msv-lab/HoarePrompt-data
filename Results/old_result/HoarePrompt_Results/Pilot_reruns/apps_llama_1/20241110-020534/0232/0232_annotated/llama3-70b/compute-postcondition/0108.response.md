Postcondition: ***The loop either completes normally with `j` equal to `n` and `found` remaining False, or it breaks out with `found` set to True and `j` set to the index where the match was found, with `window_counts` containing the counts of each color in the window. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute, leaving `found` as False, `j` as `n-1`, and `window_counts` as an empty dictionary.***
