Postcondition: ***The loop either iterates over the `colors` list from index `i` to `n`, updating the `window_counts` dictionary with the count of each color in the current window, or does not execute if `i` is greater than or equal to `n`. If the counts in `window_counts` match the target counts in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop exits, with `j` equal to the index where the match was found. Otherwise, if `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `n-1` after the loop. If `found` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, `found` remains False, `j` remains unchanged, and `window_counts` remains empty.***
