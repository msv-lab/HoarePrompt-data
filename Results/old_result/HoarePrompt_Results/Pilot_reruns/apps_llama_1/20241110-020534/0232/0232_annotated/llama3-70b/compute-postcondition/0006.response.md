Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= `n`, `colors` is a list of input integers with at least 1 element, `counts` is a list of input integers. `color_counts` is a dictionary where the key is the first element in `colors` and the value is 0 if the first element in `colors` is not already a key in `color_counts`, otherwise `color_counts` remains unchanged.***
