According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and `n`. If `right` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `right` is 1, `n` is greater than 1. `n` being greater than 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute again, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 is not enough, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. `right` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`left` is incremented by the number of times the loop executed, `current_counts[colors[left]]` is decremented by the number of times the loop executed, `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 2, `right` is 2, `n` is greater than 1 is not enough, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2**
