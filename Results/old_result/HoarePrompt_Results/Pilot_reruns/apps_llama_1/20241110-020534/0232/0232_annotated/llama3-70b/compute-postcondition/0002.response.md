The code `counts = list(map(int, input().split()))` reassigns the value of `counts` to a new list of integers. The new list is created by taking an input string, splitting it into substrings separated by whitespace, converting each substring to an integer using the `int` function, and collecting the results into a list using the `map` function.

Since the initial state specifies that `counts` is a list of non-negative integers of length `m`, the new value of `counts` will also be a list of integers, but its length and values are determined by the input.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= `n`, `colors` is a list of input integers, and `counts` is a list of input integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `m` <= `n`, `colors` is a list of input integers, and `counts` is a list of input integers**
