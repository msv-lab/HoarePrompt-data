Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary where each key is a unique color from the `colors` list and the value is the count of each color, `n` is greater than 1, `m` is a positive integer, `counts` is a list of input integers. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the target counts, then `found` is set to True and the innermost loop is exited. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged, with `found` remaining False. The values of `i` and `j` remain at 0 and 1, respectively, regardless of the condition. The `window_counts` dictionary continues to track the incremented color counts.***
