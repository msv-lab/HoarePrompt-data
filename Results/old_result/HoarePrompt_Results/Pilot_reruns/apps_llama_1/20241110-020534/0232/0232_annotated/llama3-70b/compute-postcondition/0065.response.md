The `break` statement exits the innermost loop or control structure it's directly inside. The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is True, `i` is some value, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the value of the key `colors[i]` or `colors[i + 1]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
