Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary where each key is a unique color from the `colors` list and the value is the count of each color, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `counts` is a list of input integers. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding target values in `counts` when sorted, then `found` is set to True and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, with `found` remaining False. The values of `i` and `j` are 0, and `window_counts` is a dictionary where the key is the first color in the `colors` list and the value is 1.***
