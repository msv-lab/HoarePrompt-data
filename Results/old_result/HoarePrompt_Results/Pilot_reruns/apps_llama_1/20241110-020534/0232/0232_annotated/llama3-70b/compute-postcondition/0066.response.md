Postcondition: ***`found` is either True or False, `i` is some value, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `i`, and `window_counts` is a dictionary where the value of the key `colors[i]` or `colors[i + 1]` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the target counts, then `found` is set to True and the innermost loop is exited. Otherwise, `found` remains unchanged.***
