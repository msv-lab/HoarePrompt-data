According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. For the loop to execute, `j` should be equal to `i` and `n` should be greater than `i`. Since `n` is already greater than the current value of `i`, we just need to adjust the value of `j` to be equal to `i`.

State: **`found` is False, `j` is equal to `i`, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is some value, and `n` is greater than `i`**
