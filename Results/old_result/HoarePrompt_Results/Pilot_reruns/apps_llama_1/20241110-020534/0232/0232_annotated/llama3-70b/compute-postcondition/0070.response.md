Postcondition: ***`found` is either True or False, `i` is some value, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `color` is `colors[i + 2]`. `window_counts` is a dictionary where the value of the key `colors[i]` or `colors[i + 1]` is incremented by 1, and the value of the key `colors[i + 2]` is either incremented or initialized to 0 if it was not already in the dictionary.***
