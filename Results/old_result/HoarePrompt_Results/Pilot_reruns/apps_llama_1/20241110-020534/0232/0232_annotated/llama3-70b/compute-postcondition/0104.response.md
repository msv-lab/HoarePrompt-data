Postcondition: ***`found` is either True or False, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i+2`, `n` is greater than `i`, `color` is equal to the value of `colors[i+2]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1 from its previous state, while `window_counts[colors[i+3]]` remains unchanged. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts` when sorted, then `found` is set to True and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of `found` and other variables remains unchanged.***
