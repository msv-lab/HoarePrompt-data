Output State: **`if all colors in colors have reached their desired counts before the loop starts, the function returns 'YES'. If not, the loop will continue to decrement the count of the leftmost color in colors until at least one color has not reached its desired count. At the end of the loop, left will be equal to the number of colors that have been decremented, current_counts will reflect the updated counts after the loop, and the function will not return 'YES'. If no colors have reached their desired counts before the loop starts, the loop will not execute and left will remain 0. In all cases, right will remain 0.`**
