Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` remains unchanged, `counts` remains unchanged, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 0, `j` is 0, `color` is the first element of the `colors` list, and `window_counts` has a key-value pair where the key is the first element of the `colors` list and the value is 1 (if the color was not already in `window_counts`) or the previous value plus 1 (if the color was already in `window_counts`). If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is True and the most internal loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `found` remains False.***
