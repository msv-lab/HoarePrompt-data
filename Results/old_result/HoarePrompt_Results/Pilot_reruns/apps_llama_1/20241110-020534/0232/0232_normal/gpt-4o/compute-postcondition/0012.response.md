Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than 0, `m` is a positive integer, `colors` is a list of integers in the range {1, 2,..., m} of length `n`, `k` is a list of positive integers of length `m` such that 1 <= sum(k) <= n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary where the keys are the integers from 1 to `m` and the values are the corresponding elements in `k`, `current_counts` is a dictionary with default value 0 for each key and `current_counts[colors[0]]` is less than `desired_counts[colors[0]]`, and for all other colors, `current_counts[color]` is greater than or equal to `desired_counts[color]`, `left` is 0, `right` is 0. If all colors have reached their desired counts, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the function does not return 'YES'.***
