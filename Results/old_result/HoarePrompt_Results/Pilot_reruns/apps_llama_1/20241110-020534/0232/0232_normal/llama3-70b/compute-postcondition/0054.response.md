Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i`. If `color` (which is `colors[i]`) is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` has a key-value pair where the key is `colors[i]` and the value is 0. Otherwise, the state of `window_counts` remains unchanged.***
