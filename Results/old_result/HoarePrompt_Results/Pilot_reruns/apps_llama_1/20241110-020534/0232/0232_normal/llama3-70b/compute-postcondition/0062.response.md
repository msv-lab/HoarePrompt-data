Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, the value associated with the key `colors[i]` in `window_counts` is incremented by 1, `color` is `colors[i + 1]`, and `found` is either `True` (if all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts` and the most internal loop or if statement is exited) or not changed (if not all counts in `window_counts` match their corresponding targets in `counts` and the loop or if statement continues). If `color` is not in `window_counts`, the value associated with the key `color` in `window_counts` is set to 0. Otherwise, the state of `window_counts` and `found` remains unchanged with respect to `color`.***
