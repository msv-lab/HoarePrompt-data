Postcondition: ***`i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `colors` is the list of colors, `counts` is the target counts. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to `True` and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, `found` remains unchanged and the loop or if statement continues. `window_counts` remains a dictionary where the count of the `i`-th color in the `colors` list is incremented by 1.***
