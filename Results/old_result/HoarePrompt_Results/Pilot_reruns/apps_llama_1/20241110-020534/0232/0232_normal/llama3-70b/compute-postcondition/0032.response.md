Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `counts`, `color_counts`, `i`, `j`, and `found` remain unchanged. `color` is the second element of the `colors` list. `window_counts` has a key-value pair where the key is `color` and the value is either 0 (if `color` was not already in `window_counts`) or the previous value (if `color` was already in `window_counts`).***
