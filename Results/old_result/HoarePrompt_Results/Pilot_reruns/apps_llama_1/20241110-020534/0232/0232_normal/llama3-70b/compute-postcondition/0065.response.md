Output State: **`n` is greater than `i`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i + 1`, the value associated with the key `colors[i]` in `window_counts` is incremented by 1, `color` is `colors[i + 1]`, the value associated with the key `color` (`colors[i + 1]`) in `window_counts` is incremented by 1, `found` is `True`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
