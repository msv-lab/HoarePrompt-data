Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `counts`, `color_counts`, `i`, `j` remain unchanged, `color` is the second element of the `colors` list, and `window_counts` has a key-value pair where the key is `color` and the value is either 1 (if `color` was not already in `window_counts`) or the previous value plus 1 (if `color` was already in `window_counts`). If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding target values in `counts`, then `found` is `True` and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, `found` remains unchanged.***
