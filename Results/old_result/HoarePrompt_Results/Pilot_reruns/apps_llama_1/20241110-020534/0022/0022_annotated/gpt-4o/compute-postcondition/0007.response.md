To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is a non-empty string consisting of only English letters with a length of at least 2.
- `n` is at least 3.
- `i` is 1.

Loop condition: `for i in range(n // 2):`

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `n // 2`. Since `i` is currently 1, we need to ensure that `n // 2` is greater than 1. This means `n` must be at least 4 for the loop to continue, because if `n` were 3, `n // 2` would equal 1, and the loop would not execute again.

Adjustments needed:
- `n` must be at least 4 to ensure `n // 2` is greater than 1.
- `i` will increment by 1 in the next iteration, so it will be 2.

No adjustments are needed for `s` since the loop condition does not depend on the string's properties directly.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string consisting of only English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is at least 4, and `i` is 2.**
