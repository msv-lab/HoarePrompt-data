`is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string, `n` is the length of the input string, and `is_spalindrome` is `True`.

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `n` is the length of the input string, and `is_spalindrome` is `True`.**
