The function returns `True`, indicating that the string `s` is a palindrome. The values of `s`, `n`, and `i` do not change due to the return statement. The output state is `s` is a palindrome, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, and the function returns `True`.

Output State: **`s` is a palindrome, `n` is at least 2, `i` is `n // 2 - 1`, and the function returns `True`.**
