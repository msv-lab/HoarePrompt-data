Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string, `n` is greater than or equal to 2 * i + 1, `i` is the incremented value. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is terminated. Otherwise, the state of `is_spalindrome` remains unchanged, retaining its initial value of True.***
