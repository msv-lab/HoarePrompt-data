Based on the initial state, the code prints 'TAK' if `is_spalindrome` is True, and 'NIE' if `is_spalindrome` is False. The state of `is_spalindrome` does not change, so the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that 'TAK' or 'NIE' is printed.

Output State: **`is_spalindrome` is True if the input string `s` is a palindrome, False otherwise, and 'TAK' is printed if `is_spalindrome` is True, 'NIE' is printed if `is_spalindrome` is False**
