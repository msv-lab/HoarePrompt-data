The function func accepts three integers x, y, and z. According to the annotations, the function prints '+' if x is greater than the sum of y and z, '-' if x is less than y, '0' if x equals y and z equals 0, and '?' in all other cases. However, upon closer inspection of the code, it appears that the function will always print '?' when x is greater than or equal to y but not greater than the sum of y and z, because the condition x > y + z is checked first, and if it's not true, the function will enter the else block and eventually print '?'.

Additionally, the function does not handle cases where x, y, or z are not integers, or where they are outside the range 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers x, y, and z, and prints '+' if x is greater than the sum of y and z, '-' if x is less than y, '0' if x equals y and z equals 0, and '?' in all other cases, including when x is greater than or equal to y but not greater than the sum of y and z. **
