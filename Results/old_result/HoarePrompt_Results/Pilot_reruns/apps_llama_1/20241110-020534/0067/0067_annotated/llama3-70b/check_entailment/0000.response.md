Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. According to the problem description, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the z persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations. However, the code prints '?' in cases where x is greater than or equal to y but not greater than the sum of y and z, even if the result is not uncertain.

For example, if x = 5, y = 3, and z = 2, the code will print '?', but the result is actually certain to be '+', because even if all z persons vote down, x is still greater than y.

The annotations provided do not cover this case, but they do mention that the program prints '?' in all other cases, including when x equals y but z is not 0, or when x is greater than or equal to y but not greater than the sum of y and z. This influenced my reasoning to check if the code handles all these cases correctly.

The problem description examples do not cover this case either, but they do provide examples where the result is certain, and the code handles those correctly.

Therefore, I conclude that the code is incorrect because it does not follow the problem description for every potential case.
