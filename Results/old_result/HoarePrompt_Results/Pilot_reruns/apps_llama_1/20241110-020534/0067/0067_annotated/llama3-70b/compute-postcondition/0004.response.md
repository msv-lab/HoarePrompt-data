The code `print('?')` prints the string '?' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of the variables `x`, `y`, and `z`. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional action of printing '?' to the console.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are three input integers, and '?' is printed to the console.**
