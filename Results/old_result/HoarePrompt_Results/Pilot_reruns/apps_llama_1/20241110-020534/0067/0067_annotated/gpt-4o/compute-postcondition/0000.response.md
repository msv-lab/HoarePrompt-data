To solve this problem, let's break down the given code and its impact on the initial state.

The given code is: `x, y, z = map(int, input().split())`

This line of code does the following:

1. It accepts three space-separated integer inputs using the `input()` function.
2. The `split()` function splits the input string into a list of strings, where each string represents an integer.
3. The `map(int,...)` function converts each string in the list into an integer.
4. The resulting integers are then assigned to the variables `x`, `y`, and `z` respectively.

Given the initial state that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that `0 <= x, y, z <= 100`, the code does not change the range of values that `x`, `y`, and `z` can hold. Instead, it updates the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` to the newly input integers.

However, since the specific input values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact values of `x`, `y`, and `z` after the execution of the code. We can only say that they are updated to some integer values.

Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated to some integer values.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are updated to some integer values**
