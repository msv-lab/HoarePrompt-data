Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function accepts no parameters, but it takes three integers as input from the user, which are stored in variables `x`, `y`, and `z`.

The function then calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes based on the input values.

The function then checks the following conditions:

* If the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, it prints '-'.
* If the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, it prints '+'.
* Otherwise, it prints '?'.

Now, let's consider the potential edge cases and missing logic:

* The annotations mention that the input values are within the range 0 to 100, but the code does not validate this. Therefore, the functionality should include the possibility of input values outside this range.
* The code does not handle the case where the input values are not integers. Therefore, the functionality should include the possibility of non-integer input values.
* The code does not handle the case where the input values are not provided (e.g., the user enters nothing). Therefore, the functionality should include the possibility of missing input values.

Based on the analysis, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function takes three integers as input from the user, calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes, and prints '-' if the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, '+' if the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, and '?' otherwise. The function does not validate the input values, so it may produce incorrect results if the input values are outside the range 0 to 100, are not integers, or are missing. **
