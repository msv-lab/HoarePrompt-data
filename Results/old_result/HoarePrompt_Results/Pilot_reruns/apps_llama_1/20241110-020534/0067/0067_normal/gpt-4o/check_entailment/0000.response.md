Based on my initial assessment of the code and the problem description, I think the code is correct. The code correctly calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes and prints the result accordingly. I don't see any obvious edge cases that the code might not be handling.

After reading the output hints, I agree with them that the code does not validate the input values. However, this is not a problem because the problem description specifies that the input values are integers between 0 and 100. Therefore, I don't think this is a valid concern.

The output hints also mention that the function may produce incorrect results if the input values are missing. However, this is not a valid concern because the problem description specifies that the input will be three integers.

I also checked the examples provided in the problem description, and the code produces the correct output for all of them.

Therefore, I conclude that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes and prints the result accordingly. It handles all the cases specified in the problem description, including the examples provided. The output hints do not provide any valid concerns that the code does not handle.
