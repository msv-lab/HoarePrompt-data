To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.


The initial state is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, and `min_upvotes` is an input integer equal to `x`.


Now, let's execute the given Python code snippet.


`max_upvotes = x + z`


This line of code assigns the sum of `x` and `z` to the variable `max_upvotes`. Since `x` is an input integer and `z` is an input integer, `max_upvotes` will be the sum of these two input integers.


The value of `min_upvotes` is not affected by this line of code, so it remains equal to `x`. The value of `y` is also not affected.


Therefore, the output state is: `x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is an input integer equal to `x`, and `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`.


Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is an input integer equal to `x`, and `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`.**
