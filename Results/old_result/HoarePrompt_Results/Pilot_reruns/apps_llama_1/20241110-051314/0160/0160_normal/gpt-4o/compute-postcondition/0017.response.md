Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the functionality of the function step by step.

The function `func_2` accepts an integer parameter `x`. The annotations state that `x` is an integer such that 2 <= `x` <= 500, but this is not explicitly checked in the code. Therefore, I will assume that `x` can be any integer.

The function calculates the divisors of `x` and stores them in a set called `divisors`. The loop iterates from 1 to the square root of `x` (inclusive) and checks if `x` is divisible by the current number `i`. If it is, `i` and its corresponding quotient `x // i` are added to the `divisors` set.

After the loop, the function returns the sorted divisors in descending order.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If `x` is 1, the loop will not execute, and the `divisors` set will remain empty. In this case, the function will return an empty list.
* If `x` is a prime number, the `divisors` set will only contain 1 and `x` itself.
* If `x` is a negative integer, the loop will not execute correctly, and the `divisors` set may not contain all divisors of `x`. However, this case is not explicitly handled in the code.
* If `x` is 0, the loop will not execute, and the `divisors` set will remain empty. In this case, the function will return an empty list.

Based on the analysis, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `x` and returns the sorted divisors of `x` in descending order. If `x` is 1, the function returns an empty list. If `x` is a prime number, the function returns a list containing 1 and `x`. If `x` is a negative integer, the function may not return all divisors of `x`. If `x` is 0, the function returns an empty list. **
