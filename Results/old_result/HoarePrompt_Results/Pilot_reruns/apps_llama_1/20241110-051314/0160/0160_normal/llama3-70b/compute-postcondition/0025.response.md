Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 1, `gcd` is at least 9, `i` is 3, `A` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `K` is an input integer. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and `gcd` divided by `i`. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, retaining the initial conditions. In all cases, `max_divisor` is either the greatest common divisor of the first `N` integers in the list `A` or the first integer in the list `A`, and is at least 3.***
