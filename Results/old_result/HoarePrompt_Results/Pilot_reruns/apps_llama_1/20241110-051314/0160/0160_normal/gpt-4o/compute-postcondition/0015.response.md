The function returns the sorted divisors in descending order. The set divisors contains all divisors of x, including 1 and x itself. The sorting does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the function returns the sorted divisors.

Output State: **N remains unchanged, K remains unchanged, A remains unchanged, i is the square root of x, divisors contains all divisors of x, and the function returns the sorted divisors in descending order.**
