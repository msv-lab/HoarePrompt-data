The code `A = list(map(int, input().split()))` reassigns the value of `A` by taking a new input and splitting it into a list of integers. The initial state of `A` is a list of N integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), but this new assignment overwrites that value.

The new value of `A` is a list of integers, but the length and values of the list are determined by the new input. The previous values of `N` and `K` are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`N` is an input integer, `K` is an input integer, `A` is a new list of integers**
