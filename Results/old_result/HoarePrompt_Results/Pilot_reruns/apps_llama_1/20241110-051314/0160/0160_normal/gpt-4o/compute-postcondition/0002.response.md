The code `divisors.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the `divisors` set. Since `i` is 1, the value 1 is added to the `divisors` set.

Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, divisors is a set containing 1, x is an integer such that x >= 1, i is 1**
