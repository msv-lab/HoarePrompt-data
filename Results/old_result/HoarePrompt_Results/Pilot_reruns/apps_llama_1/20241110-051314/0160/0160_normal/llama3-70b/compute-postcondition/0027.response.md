To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition: `for i in range(1, int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1):`

The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, `gcd` is at least 9. Since `i` is 3, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` must be at least 3 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `gcd` must be at least 9 and its square root must be at least 3, which is already satisfied. However, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4 for the loop to execute again.

Other states do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`N` is at least 1, `gcd` is at least 9, `i` is 4, `A` is a list of integers with at least one integer, `K` is an input integer. `max_divisor` is either the greatest common divisor of the first `N` integers in the list `A` or the first integer in the list `A`. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value, `i`, and `gcd` divided by `i` if `i` squared is not equal to `gcd`. In all cases, `max_divisor` is at least 3.**
