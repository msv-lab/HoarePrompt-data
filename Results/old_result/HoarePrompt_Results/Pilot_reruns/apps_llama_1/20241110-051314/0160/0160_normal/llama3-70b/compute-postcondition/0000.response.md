The values of N and K are updated to the input values, where N is an integer and K is an integer. The value of N can be any integer and K can be any integer. The state of A is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an input integer, K is an input integer, and A is a list of N integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive).
Output State: **N is an input integer, K is an input integer, and A is a list of N integers between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive)**
