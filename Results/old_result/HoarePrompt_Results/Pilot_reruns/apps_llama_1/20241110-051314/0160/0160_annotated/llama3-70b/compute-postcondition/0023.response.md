The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. The current value of `i` is 3. Since `max_divisor` is at least 1, the new value of `max_divisor` will be at least 3. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`max_divisor` is at least 3, `i` is 3, `A` is a non-empty list of input integers with at least `N` elements, `K` is an input integer, `N` is at least 1, and `gcd` is greater than or equal to 4**
