Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

The problem description requires computing the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. However, the code does not consider the operations that can be performed between 0 and K times. It only calculates the greatest common divisor of the elements in the list A, which is not sufficient to solve the problem.

The function `func_1` calculates the greatest common divisor of the elements in the list A, but it does not take into account the operations that can be performed. The function `func_2` calculates the divisors of a number, but it is not used correctly in the context of the problem.

The problem description provides an example where the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations is 7, but the code would not be able to produce this result because it does not consider the operations.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and the correctness is **False**.
