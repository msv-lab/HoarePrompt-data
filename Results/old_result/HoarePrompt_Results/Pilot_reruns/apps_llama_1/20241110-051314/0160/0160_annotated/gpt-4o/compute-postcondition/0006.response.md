Let's analyze the code step by step:

* The code adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`.
* The initial state of `divisors` is a set containing the values 1 and `x` if `x` is divisible by `i`, otherwise it remains an empty set.
* The value of `i` is 2.
* Since `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, it is divisible by 2.

Therefore, the set `divisors` will contain the values 1, `x`, and 2.

Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `divisors` is a set containing the values 1, `x`, and 2**
