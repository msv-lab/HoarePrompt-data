To solve this problem, we need to analyze the given code and the initial state.


The given code is `divisors.add(i)`.


From the initial state, we know that `divisors` is an empty set and `i` is 1.


When we add `i` to the `divisors` set, we are essentially adding the value 1 to the set.


So, the output state is: `N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `divisors` is a set containing the value 1, `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1.


Output State: **`N` is an integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 500, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, each between 1 and 10^6 (inclusive), `divisors` is a set containing the value 1, `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1**
