Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is at least 1, `i` is 1, `A` is a non-empty list of input integers with at least `N` elements, `K` is an input integer, and `N` is at least 1. If `i` squared is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its previous value and the integer division of `gcd` by `i`. If `i` squared equals `gcd`, no update occurs to `max_divisor`.***
