To determine the state at the start of the for loop, we need to analyze the loop statement. The loop iterates over a range of `n`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be a positive integer (greater than 0). The variable `_` is a throwaway variable, which means its value is not used in the loop body, so we don't need to worry about its state.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is an empty list**
