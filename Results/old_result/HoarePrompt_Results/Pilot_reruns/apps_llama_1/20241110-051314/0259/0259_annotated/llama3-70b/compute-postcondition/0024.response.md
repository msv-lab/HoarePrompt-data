Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list of `n` tuples with `n` greater than 0, `s` is `buses[1][0]`, `d` is `buses[1][1]`, `i` is 1, `t` remains unchanged. If `(t - s) % d` is less than the initial value of `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `(t - s) % d` and `ans` is set to 2. Otherwise, `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
