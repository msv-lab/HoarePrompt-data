The function accepts a positive integer n, a positive integer t, and a list of n tuples bus_routes, and returns the index of the route with the minimum wait time if n is greater than 0, otherwise returns -1. However, the function may not work correctly for all possible inputs, especially when n is 0, or the input list bus_routes is empty or contains invalid data.
