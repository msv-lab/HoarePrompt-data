To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `i in range(n)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

In the current state, `i` is 1 and `n` is a positive integer. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `n` needs to be at least 2.

Additionally, since `s_i` and `d_i` are derived from the `i-th` tuple in `bus_routes`, we need to update their values to reflect the next tuple in the list. Specifically, `s_i` should be the first element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, and `d_i` should be the second element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`.

The other variables, such as `t`, `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route`, do not affect the loop condition and can remain unchanged.

Therefore, the adjusted state is:

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the first element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the third tuple in `bus_routes**, `wait_time` is the same value as before, `min_wait_time` is the same value as before, `chosen_route` is the same value as before**
