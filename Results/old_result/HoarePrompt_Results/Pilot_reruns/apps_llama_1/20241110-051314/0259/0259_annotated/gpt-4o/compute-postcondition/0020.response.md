`chosen_route` is assigned the value `i + 1`, and `i` is 1, so `chosen_route` is 2. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is the previously calculated value, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is the previously calculated value, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is 2**
