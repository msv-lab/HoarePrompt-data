To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The code is: `chosen_route = i + 1`

From the initial state, we know that `i` is 2.

So, `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, which is `2 + 1 = 3`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the first element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is the minimum time to wait for the next bus based on `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the first element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is the minimum time to wait for the next bus based on `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`, `min_wait_time` is equal to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is 3**
