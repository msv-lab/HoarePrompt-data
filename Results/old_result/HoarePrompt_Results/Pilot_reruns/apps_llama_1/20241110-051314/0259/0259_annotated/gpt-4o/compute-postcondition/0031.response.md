Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the first element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`. The minimum wait time for the next bus is calculated based on the relationship between `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. If the calculated `wait_time` is less than the current `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to 3. Otherwise, `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. In all cases, the program maintains the relationship between `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` to ensure the correct calculation of `wait_time` and updates `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` accordingly.***
