The code `buses.append((s, d))` appends a tuple containing the values of `s` and `d` to the list `buses`. 

Since `buses` is initially an empty list, after execution, `buses` will contain one tuple with the values of `s` and `d`. The values of `n`, `t`, `s`, and `d` are not changed.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is a list containing one tuple with input integers `s` and `d`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
