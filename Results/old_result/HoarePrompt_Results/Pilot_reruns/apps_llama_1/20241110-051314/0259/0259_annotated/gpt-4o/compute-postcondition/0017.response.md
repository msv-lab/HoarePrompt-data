Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the first element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the second tuple in `bus_routes`. If `(t - s_i)` is a multiple of `d_i`, `wait_time` is 0, indicating no waiting time is required. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the remaining time until the next bus arrival.***
