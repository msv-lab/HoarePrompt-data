`s` and `d` are reassigned the values of the input integers from `input().split()`, which is a list of two integers. The `map` function applies the `int` function to each element of the list, converting them to integers. The values of `n`, `t`, and `buses` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is a list containing two tuples with input integers, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is a list containing two tuples with input integers, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
