Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` tuples, `i` is 2, `s_i` is the first element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the third tuple in `bus_routes`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is `s_i - t`. If `t` is a multiple of `d_i` plus `s_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is the difference between `d_i` and the remainder of `t - s_i` divided by `d_i`, ensuring `wait_time` is the minimum time to wait for the next bus. In all cases, `wait_time` is calculated based on the relationship between `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`, covering all possible scenarios.***
