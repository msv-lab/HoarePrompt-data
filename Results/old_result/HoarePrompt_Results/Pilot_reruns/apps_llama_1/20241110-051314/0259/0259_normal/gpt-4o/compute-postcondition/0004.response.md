To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
wait_time = s_i - t
```
From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is a positive integer
- `t` is a positive integer
- `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers
- `min_wait_time` is infinity
- `chosen_route` is -1
- `i` is 0
- `s_i` is the first element of the first pair in `bus_routes`
- `d_i` is the second element of the first pair in `bus_routes`

The code calculates `wait_time` as the difference between `s_i` and `t`. Since `s_i` and `t` are both positive integers, `wait_time` will be an integer. However, we cannot determine the exact value of `wait_time` without knowing the specific values of `s_i` and `t`.

The output state will be the same as the initial state, with the addition of `wait_time` being assigned a value that is the difference between `s_i` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first pair in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the first pair in `bus_routes`, `wait_time` is `s_i` - `t`**
