Based on the given initial state and the provided code snippet, let's analyze the impact of the code on the program.

The code snippet is `min_wait_time = wait_time`. This line of code assigns the value of `wait_time` to `min_wait_time`.

In the initial state, `min_wait_time` is infinity, and `wait_time` has a specific value based on the conditions:
- If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is `s_i` minus `t`.
- If `(t - s_i)` is a multiple of `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0.
- Otherwise, `wait_time` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to `d_i`, calculated as `d_i` minus the remainder of `(t - s_i)` divided by `d_i`.

Since `wait_time` is assigned to `min_wait_time`, the value of `min_wait_time` will be updated to the value of `wait_time`. The values of other variables remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is:
`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is the value of `wait_time` (which is either `s_i` minus `t`, 0, or a non-negative integer less than or equal to `d_i`), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first pair in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the first pair in `bus_routes`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the first element of the first pair in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the first pair in `bus_routes`.**
