The code initializes the `wait_time` variable to 0. The other variables are not affected by this code.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than 1, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of `n` pairs of positive integers, `min_wait_time` is the minimum of its initial value and the calculated `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is either 1 or 2, `i` is the next integer, `s_i` is the first element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, `d_i` is the second element of the `i-th` pair in `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is 0**
