According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Since `n` is already a positive integer, it is guaranteed to be at least 1. However, the loop variable `_` is not explicitly defined before the loop. 

To ensure the loop can execute, the state of `_` needs to be adjusted to a value that will be used in the first iteration of the loop, which is 0.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
