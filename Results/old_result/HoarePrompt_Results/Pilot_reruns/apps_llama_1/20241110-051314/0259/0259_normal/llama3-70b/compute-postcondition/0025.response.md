To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop statement and the given state.

The loop statement is: `for (i, (s, d)) in enumerate(buses):`

From this statement, we can see that the loop will execute as long as there are more tuples in the `buses` list.

Given state:
- `buses` is a list of at least 2 tuples
- `s` is the first element of the second tuple in `buses`
- `d` is the second element of the second tuple in `buses`
- `_` is `n-1`
- `i` is 1

Since `i` is 1, it means the loop has already executed once, and we are now at the end of the first iteration. For the loop to execute again, we need to adjust the state as follows:

- `buses` should still be a list of at least 2 tuples (no change needed)
- `s` should be the first element of the third tuple in `buses` (since we've moved to the next tuple)
- `d` should be the second element of the third tuple in `buses`
- `_` is still `n-1` (no change needed)
- `i` should be 2 (since we've moved to the next iteration)

Note that the values of `min_time` and `ans` are not relevant to the loop execution, so we don't need to adjust them.

State: **`buses` is a list of at least 3 tuples, `s` is the first element of the third tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the third tuple in `buses`, `_` is `n-1`, `i` is 2**
