According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list has at least 1 tuple, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `buses` is a list of `n` tuples, but it does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `buses` is a list of at least 1 tuple. Additionally, the loop uses `enumerate` which means it will iterate over the indices and values of the list, so `i` should be initialized to 0 and `(s, d)` should be the first tuple in the list.

State: **`buses` is a list of at least 1 tuple, `s` is the first element of the first tuple in `buses`, `d` is the second element of the first tuple in `buses`, `_` is `n-1`, `min_time` is positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0**
