Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly implements the k-rounding of a given positive integer n. The function `func_1` calculates the k-rounding by multiplying n with the smallest possible multiplier that results in a number ending with k or more zeros in base 10 and is divisible by n.

The multiplier is calculated as `10 ** k`, which is the smallest number that ends with k zeros in base 10. The `math.gcd` function is used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of n and the multiplier, which is then used to find the smallest multiple of n that is divisible by the multiplier.

The program handles all possible cases, including:

* When k is 0, the program returns n as the k-rounding, which is correct.
* When n is a multiple of 10^k, the program returns n as the k-rounding, which is correct.
* When n is not a multiple of 10^k, the program calculates the smallest multiple of n that is divisible by 10^k and returns it as the k-rounding, which is correct.

The program also handles edge cases, such as when n is 1 or when k is 8 (the maximum possible value of k).

Overall, the program is correct and works as expected for all possible inputs.
