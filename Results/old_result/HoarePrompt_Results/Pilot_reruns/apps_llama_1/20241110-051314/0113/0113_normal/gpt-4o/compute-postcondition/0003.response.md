The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and `k` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8. After executing the function body, the function returns a multiple of `n`, which is a result of a calculation involving a power of 10 (`multiplier`) and another multiple of `n` (`x`). 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and returns a multiple of `n`.**
