To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet based on the initial state provided.

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer

Given Code:
```python
x = 10 ** k
```

This line of code assigns the value of `10` raised to the power of `k` to the variable `x`. The values of `n` and `k` are input integers, but since the operation does not directly involve `n`, the value of `n` remains unchanged. The value of `k`, however, is used to calculate `x`.

Therefore, after the execution of the code:
- The value of `n` remains an input integer.
- The value of `k` remains an input integer.
- The variable `x` is assigned the value of `10` raised to the power of `k`, where `k` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `x` is 10 raised to the power of an input integer**
