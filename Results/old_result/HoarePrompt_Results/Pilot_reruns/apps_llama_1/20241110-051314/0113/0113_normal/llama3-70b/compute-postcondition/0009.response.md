The code `print(n)` prints the value of `n` to the console. The value of `n` is the smallest multiple of `x` that is greater than or equal to the input integer `n`. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is the smallest multiple of `x` that is greater than or equal to the input integer `n`, `k` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, and the value of `n` is printed to the console.**
