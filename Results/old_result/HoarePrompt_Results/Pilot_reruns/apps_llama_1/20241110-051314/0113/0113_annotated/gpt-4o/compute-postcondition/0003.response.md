The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= k <= 8. After executing the function body, the function returns `x`, which is `n` multiplied by a power of 10. The power of 10 is determined by the value of `k`, where `k` corresponds to a multiplier of 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and return the product of `n` and a power of 10 determined by `k`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, and returns the product of `n` and a power of 10 determined by `k`.**
