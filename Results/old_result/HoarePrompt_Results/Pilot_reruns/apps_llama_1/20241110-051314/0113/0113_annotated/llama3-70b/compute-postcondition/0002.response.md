The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is an input integer, so the new value of `n` is the input integer plus 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer plus 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer plus 1, `k` is an input integer, `x` is 10 raised to the power of `k`.**
