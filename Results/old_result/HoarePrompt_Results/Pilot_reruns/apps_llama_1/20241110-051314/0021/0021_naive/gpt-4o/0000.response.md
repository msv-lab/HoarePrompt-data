Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the problem description. The issue lies in the way it calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements. The program calculates the distances from the minimum and maximum elements to the start and end of the array, but it does not consider the possibility of swapping the minimum or maximum element with another element in the array to maximize the distance.

A counterexample is when the input is 4 and the array is [2, 1, 4, 3]. The program will output 3, but the correct answer is 4, which can be achieved by swapping the elements at positions 1 and 3. The program does not consider this possibility and therefore does not produce the correct result.

The program should be modified to consider all possible swaps of the minimum and maximum elements with other elements in the array, and then choose the swap that maximizes the distance between the minimum and maximum elements.
