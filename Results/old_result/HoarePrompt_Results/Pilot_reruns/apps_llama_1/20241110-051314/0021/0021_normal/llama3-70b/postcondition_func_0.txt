The function accepts no parameters but uses two variables n and a, calculates the indices of the first occurrence of 1 and n in the list a, and prints the maximum possible distance between 1 and n in the list a, considering the boundaries, without handling the cases when 1 or n is not present in the list a and without validating the input for n and a.
