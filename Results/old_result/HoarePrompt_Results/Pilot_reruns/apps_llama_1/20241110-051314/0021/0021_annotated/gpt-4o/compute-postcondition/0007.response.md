The code calculates the absolute value of the difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos` and assigns it to `dist4`. The values of `n`, `a`, `min_pos`, `max_pos`, `dist1`, `dist2`, and `dist3` are not changed.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is the absolute value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`, `dist3` is `min_pos`, and `dist4` is `abs(n - 1 - min_pos)`**
