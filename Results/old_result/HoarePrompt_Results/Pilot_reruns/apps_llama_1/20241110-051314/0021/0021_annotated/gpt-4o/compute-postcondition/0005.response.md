To calculate the output state, let's break down the given code and initial state.

Initial State: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, and `dist1` is the absolute value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.

The code is: `dist2 = abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`

The impact of the code is to calculate a new variable `dist2` based on the existing variables `n` and `max_pos`.

Since `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, we can assume that `max_pos` is equal to `dist1` (the absolute value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`).

The value of `dist2` is calculated as the absolute value of the difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`. 

However, without knowing the exact value of `n` and `max_pos`, we cannot determine the exact value of `dist2`. But we can express `dist2` in terms of `n` and `max_pos`.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is the absolute value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, and `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, `dist1` is the absolute value of the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`, and `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`**
