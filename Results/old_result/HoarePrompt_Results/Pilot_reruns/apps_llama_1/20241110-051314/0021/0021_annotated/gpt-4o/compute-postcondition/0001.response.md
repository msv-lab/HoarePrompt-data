The code reassigns the value of `a` by taking a new input and splitting it into a list of integers. The previous value of `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, but this value is overwritten. The new value of `a` is a list of integers, but the length and values of this list are determined by the new input.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of input integers**
