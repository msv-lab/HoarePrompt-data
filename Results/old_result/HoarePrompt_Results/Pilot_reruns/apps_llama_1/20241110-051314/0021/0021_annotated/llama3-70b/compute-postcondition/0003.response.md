The code `posn = a.index(n)` assigns the index of the first occurrence of the number `n` in the list `a` to the variable `posn`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and the list `a` is a list of integers from a new input.

The output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from a new input, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of the number 1 in the list `a`, and `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of the number `n` in the list `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of integers from a new input, `pos1` is the index of the first occurrence of the number 1 in the list `a`, and `posn` is the index of the first occurrence of the number `n` in the list `a`.**
