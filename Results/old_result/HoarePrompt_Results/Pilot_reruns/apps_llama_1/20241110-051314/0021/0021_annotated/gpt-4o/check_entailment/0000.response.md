Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that Nicholas has an array `a` that contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, but the code does not check if the input list `a` actually contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`. 

For example, if the input is `n = 5` and `a = [1, 2, 2, 4, 5]`, the code will still calculate the distances and print the maximum distance, even though the input list `a` contains duplicates. 

The annotations mention that the function may produce incorrect results if the input list `a` contains duplicates or integers outside the range 1 to `n`, which is correct. However, the code does not handle these cases, it simply assumes that the input is valid.

Additionally, the problem description states that Nicholas wants to perform exactly one swap to maximize the distance between the minimum and the maximum elements, but the code does not actually perform any swaps, it simply calculates the distances and prints the maximum distance.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and it is incorrect.
