The function returns `teens[n - 10]`, where `n` is an integer such that 10 <= n <= 19, because the list `teens` represents numbers from eleven to nineteen. The value of `n - 10` will be an integer between 1 and 9. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `n` is an integer such that 10 <= n <= 19, and the function returns a string representing a number between eleven and nineteen.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 10 <= n <= 19, and the function returns a string representing a number between eleven and nineteen**
