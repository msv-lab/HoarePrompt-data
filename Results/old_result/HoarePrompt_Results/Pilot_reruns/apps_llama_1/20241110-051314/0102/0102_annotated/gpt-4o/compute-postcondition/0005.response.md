The function returns `tens[n // 10]`. Since `n` is an integer between 0 and 99, `n // 10` will be an integer between 0 and 9. This value is used as an index to access the corresponding string in the `tens` list.

The `tens` list contains strings representing tens from ten to ninety, so the returned value will be a string representing the tens place of the number `n`.

The state of the variables `n`, `ones`, and `teens` does not change.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from ten to ninety, and the function returns a string representing the tens place of `n`.**
