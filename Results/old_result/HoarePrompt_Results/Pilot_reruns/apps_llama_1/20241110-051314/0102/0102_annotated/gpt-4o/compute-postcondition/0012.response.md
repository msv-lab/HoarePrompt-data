The function func_1 accepts an integer n and returns its string representation in the following format: 

- If n is between 0 and 9, it returns the string representation of n from the ones list.
- If n is between 11 and 19, it returns the string representation of n from the teens list.
- If n is a multiple of 10 and greater than or equal to 10, it returns the string representation of the tens place of n from the tens list.
- If n is greater than 10 and not a multiple of 10, it returns a string in the format "tens-ones" representing the tens and ones places of n.

However, the function does not handle the case when n is 10, which is a multiple of 10 but does not return the string representation of the tens place of n from the tens list. Instead, it returns 'ten' from the teens list which is incorrect.

Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer n such that 0 <= n <= 99 and returns its string representation in the format "ones", "teens", "tens", or "tens-ones" based on the value of n, but does not correctly handle the case when n is 10. **
