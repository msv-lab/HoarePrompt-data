Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 <= n <= 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens from ten to ninety. The function returns a string representation of `n` in the following format: if `n` is between 0 and 9, it returns the string representation of `n` from the `ones` list; if `n` is between 11 and 19, it returns the string representation of `n` from the `teens` list; if `n` is a multiple of 10 and greater than or equal to 10, it returns the string representation of the tens place of `n` from the `tens` list; if `n` is greater than 10 and not a multiple of 10, it returns a string in the format "tens-ones" representing the tens and ones places of `n`.***
