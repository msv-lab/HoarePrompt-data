Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description requires the code to handle numbers between 10 and 19 correctly, but the code does not. According to the code, if `n` is between 10 and 19, it returns the tens place name corresponding to the value of `n` followed by a hyphen and the ones place name corresponding to the value of `n`. However, this is incorrect. For example, when `n` is 10, the code returns 'ten-' + 'zero', which is not the correct output. The correct output should be 'ten'. 

Additionally, the code does not handle numbers less than 0 or 100 or more correctly. According to the problem description, the input should be between 0 and 99, but the code does not check for this condition. If `n` is less than 0 or 100 or more, the code does not return any value, which is not the expected behavior.

The output hints agree with the code and provide examples of the incorrect outputs for numbers between 10 and 19. Therefore, based on the code and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is not correct.
