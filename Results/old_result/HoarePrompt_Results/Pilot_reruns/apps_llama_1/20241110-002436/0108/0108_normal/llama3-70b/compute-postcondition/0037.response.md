Output State: **The loop replaces each character in the input string `s` with the next character in the alphabet and adds the replaced character to the result string `res`. If a character is not in `s`, the loop does not execute for that character. After the loop executes, `res` is a string containing all characters from `s` in the order they appear in the alphabet, and `s` is the input string with all characters replaced by the next character in the alphabet. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty string. If `s` contains characters not in the alphabet, the loop will still execute for the characters in the alphabet, but the non-alphabet characters will remain unchanged in `s`.**
