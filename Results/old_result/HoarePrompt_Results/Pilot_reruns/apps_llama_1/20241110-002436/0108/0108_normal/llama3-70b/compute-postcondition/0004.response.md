The code `res += char` appends the value of `char` to the end of the string `res`. 

The value of `res` is initially an empty string, and the value of `char` is 'a'. 

After execution, `res` will be 'a'. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a new input string, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is a new input string, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'.**
