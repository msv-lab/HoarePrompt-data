Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

Initially, I assessed the code and the problem description, and it seemed that the code correctly implemented the required functionality. The code replaces each character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet and adds the replaced characters to a result string in alphabetical order. If the result string contains all 26 characters of the alphabet, it prints the result string; otherwise, it prints -1.

Upon reviewing the output hints, I found that they agree with the code. The hints mention that the function does not handle empty input strings or non-alphabet characters, and in these cases, it will print -1. However, the problem description does not specify what should happen in these cases, so it is not clear if this is a bug or not.

I did not find any edge cases that the code does not handle. The code correctly handles the case where the input string is a subsequence of the alphabet, and it correctly handles the case where the input string is not a subsequence of the alphabet.

The examples provided in the problem description also work correctly. The first example, "aacceeggiikkmmooqqssuuwwyy", is correctly transformed into "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz", and the second example, "thereisnoanswer", correctly prints -1.

Overall, I believe that the code correctly implements the required functionality and handles all potential cases.
