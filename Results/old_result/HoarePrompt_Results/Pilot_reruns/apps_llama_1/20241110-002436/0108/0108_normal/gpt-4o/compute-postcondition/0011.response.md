To determine which states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the conditions in the `while` loop statement.

The loop will execute as long as two conditions are met:

1. `i < len(s)`
2. `j < target_len`

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

- `s` is an input string
- `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
- `target_len` is 26
- `i` is increased by 1 again
- `len(s)` is greater than `i`
- `j` is less than 26

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that both conditions are still met after the previous iteration.

1. Since `i` is increased by 1 and `len(s)` is greater than `i`, we need to ensure that `len(s)` is greater than the new value of `i`. This condition is already met based on the given state, so no adjustment is needed for `len(s)` and `i`.

2. Since `j` is less than 26 and `target_len` is 26, we need to ensure that `j` remains less than 26 after the previous iteration. The given state already indicates that `j` is less than 26, but to guarantee the loop can execute again, we should specify that `j` is less than 25, because it could have been 25 at the end of the last iteration and could be incremented.

Therefore, the adjusted state for the loop to execute one more time is:

State: **`s` is an input string, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1 again, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `j` is less than 25**
