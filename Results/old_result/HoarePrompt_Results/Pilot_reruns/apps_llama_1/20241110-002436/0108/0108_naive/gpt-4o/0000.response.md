Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly when the input string contains characters that can be replaced to form the target string. According to the problem description, in one move, any character of the string can be replaced to the next character in alphabetical order. However, the program does not perform this replacement operation.

For example, if the input string is "aaaaaa", the program will output "-1" because it does not find the target string as a subsequence. However, it is possible to replace the characters in the input string to form the target string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" by replacing 'a' with 'b', 'c', 'd',..., 'z' in each move.

The program only checks if the input string contains the target string as a subsequence without considering the replacement operation. Therefore, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
