To ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to examine the conditions in the `while` loop statement: `i < len(s)` and `j < target_len`.

1. For `i < len(s)`: Since `i` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, to ensure this condition is still true, `i` must be less than `len(s) - 1` at the end of the previous iteration. However, we don't need to adjust `i` itself, but rather ensure that the condition can be met given its increase. Thus, we need to make sure that `len(s)` is greater than `i + 1`.

2. For `j < target_len`: Since `j` retains its original value, and `target_len` is a constant 26, we simply need to ensure that `j` is less than 26 for the condition to be true. Given that `j` doesn't change, we don't need to adjust its state for the loop to proceed, but we should note that `j` must be less than 26 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the adjustments needed are to ensure `len(s)` is greater than `i + 1` and to note that `j` is less than 26.

State: **`s` is an input string with length greater than `i + 1`, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is less than 26 and retains its original value**
