Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string with length greater than `i + 1`, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1. If the character at index `i` in `s` matches the character at index `j` in `target`, then `j` is incremented by 1, otherwise `j` retains its original value.***
