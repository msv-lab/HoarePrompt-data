The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is less than 26. Therefore, the new value of `j` is still less than 27, but since `j` is an index for `target` which has a length of 26, `j` is still less than or equal to 26. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an input string with length greater than `i + 1`, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is less than or equal to 26.

Output State: **`s` is an input string with length greater than `i + 1`, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is less than or equal to 26**
