Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string with length greater than `i + 2`, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 2 from its original value. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, `j` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `j` retains its original value.***
