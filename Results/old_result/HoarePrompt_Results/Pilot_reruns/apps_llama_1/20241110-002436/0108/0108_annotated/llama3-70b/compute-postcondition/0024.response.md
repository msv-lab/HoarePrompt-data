Output State: **If `s` contains at least one 'a', then `res` is a string of 'a's equal to the number of 'a's in `s` followed by a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in `s`, `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's and all 'b's replaced by 'c's, `char` is the character that comes after the last 'b' in the alphabet, which is 'c'. If `s` does not contain any 'a's and contains at least one 'b', then `res` is a string of 'b's equal to the number of 'b's in `s`, `s` is the input string with all 'b's replaced by 'c's, `char` is 'c'. If `s` does not contain any 'a's and does not contain any 'b's, then `res` remains an empty string, `s` remains the input string, `char` is 'b'.**
