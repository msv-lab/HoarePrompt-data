Output State: **if `s` contains at least one 'a' then `res` is a string of 'a's equal to the number of 'a's in `s`, `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, `char` remains 'a'. if `s` does not contain any 'a's then the loop doesn't execute and `res` remains an empty string, `s` remains the input string, `char` remains 'a'.**
