To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. The initial state is: `res` remains the same, `s` has one less 'd' and one more 'e' and `s` still has at least one 'd', `char` is 'd'.
2. The code is: `res += char`. This means we are appending the value of `char` to `res`.
3. Since `char` is 'd', `res` will have 'd' appended to it.
4. The state of `s` is not affected by this operation, so it remains the same.
5. The value of `char` is not changed in this operation, so it remains 'd'.

Considering these points, the output state is: `res` has 'd' appended to it, `s` has one less 'd' and one more 'e' and `s` still has at least one 'd', `char` is 'd'.

Output State: **`res` has 'd' appended to it, `s` has one less 'd' and one more 'e' and `s` still has at least one 'd', `char` is 'd'.**
