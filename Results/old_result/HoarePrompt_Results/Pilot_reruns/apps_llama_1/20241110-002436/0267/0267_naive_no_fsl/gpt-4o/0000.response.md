Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program correctly defines the function `func_1(n, k)` to check if a number `n` has at most `k` different digits. This function works by converting the number to a string, creating a set of its digits (which removes duplicates), and checking if the length of the set is less than or equal to `k`.

2. The program correctly defines the function `func_2(l, r, k)` to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) that have at most `k` different digits. This function iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, checks each number using `func_1(n, k)`, and adds it to the total sum if it meets the condition. The sum is calculated modulo `998244353` to prevent overflow.

3. The program correctly reads the input values `l`, `r`, and `k` from the user and calls `func_2(l, r, k)` to calculate the sum.

4. The program correctly handles the modulo operation to prevent overflow and ensure the result is within the required range.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program would not work as expected according to the problem description. The code is well-structured, and the logic is correct. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
