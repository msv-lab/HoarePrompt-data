Output State: **The loop calculates the sum of numbers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)` and stores it in `total_sum` modulo MOD. If no numbers in the range satisfy the condition, `total_sum` remains 0. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute and `total_sum` remains 0. After the loop executes, `total_sum` is the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)`, modulo MOD, and `num` is equal to `r`. If `l` is equal to `r`, the loop executes once and `total_sum` is either `l % MOD` or 0, depending on the result of `func_1(l, k)`.**
