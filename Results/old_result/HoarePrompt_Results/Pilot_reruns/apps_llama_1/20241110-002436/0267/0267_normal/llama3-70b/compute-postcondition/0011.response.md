To determine the output state, let's break down the given code and its impact on the variables.

The code is: `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `k` is a positive integer such that `k` > 2 and `k` <= 10.
- `dp` is a dictionary with an additional key-value pair `(n, k)` with a value in one of the calculated ranges.
- `i` is 3.

Let's substitute `i` with 3 in the equation and simplify:
- `10 ** (i - 1)` becomes `10 ** (3 - 1)` which is `10 ** 2` or 100.
- `10 ** (k - i)` becomes `10 ** (k - 3)`.
- The equation simplifies to: `dp[n, k] += 9 * 100 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100)`.

Now, let's consider the range of `k`. Since `k` > 2 and `k` <= 10, when `k` is 3, the term `10 ** (k - 3)` equals 1, and when `k` is 10, `10 ** (k - 3)` equals 10^7. 

Given the range of `k`, the term `(10 ** (k - 3) - 100)` will vary, but it will always be a positive integer because `10 ** (k - 3)` will always be greater than 100 for `k` > 3.

Thus, the value added to `dp[n, k]` is a positive integer, specifically `900 * (10 ** (k - 3) - 100)`, but since the exact value of `k` is not specified within its range, we can't give an exact numerical value. However, we can say that `dp[n, k]` increases by a positive amount that depends on `k`.

The other variables (`n`, `k`, and `i`) are not directly modified by this operation, so their values remain the same.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a non-negative integer.
- `k` is a positive integer such that `k` > 2 and `k` <= 10.
- `dp` is a dictionary with the value for key `(n, k)` increased by a positive amount dependent on `k`.
- `i` is 3.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` > 2 and `k` <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary with the value for key `(n, k)` increased by a positive amount dependent on `k`, and `i` is 3**
