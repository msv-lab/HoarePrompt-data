The code `dp[n, k] %= MOD` takes the value of `dp[n, k]` and applies the modulo operation with `MOD`. The result of this operation is then assigned back to `dp[n, k]`.

Since the initial state of `dp[n, k]` is dependent on `k`, let's analyze the possible cases:

- If `k` is 1, `dp[n, k]` is 9. After applying the modulo operation, `dp[n, k]` will be 9 % MOD, which is a value between 0 and MOD-1.
- If `k` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `dp[n, k]` is increased by a positive amount dependent on `k`. After applying the modulo operation, `dp[n, k]` will still be a value between 0 and MOD-1.
- If `k` is greater than 10, the value of `dp[n, k]` might not be valid. However, the modulo operation will still be applied, resulting in a value between 0 and MOD-1.

In all cases, the value of `dp[n, k]` will be a value between 0 and MOD-1 after the modulo operation.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is a value between 0 and MOD-1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer**
