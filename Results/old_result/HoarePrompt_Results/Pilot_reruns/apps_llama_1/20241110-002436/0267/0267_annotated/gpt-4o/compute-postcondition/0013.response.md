The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, and `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. After executing the function body, the function returns the sum of all numbers in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(num, k)` is true, taken modulo `MOD`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, and return the sum of all numbers in the range `[l, r]` that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)` is true, modulo `MOD`.

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, and returns the sum of all numbers in the range `[l, r]` that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)` is true, modulo `MOD`.**
