Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. 

One case that the code does not handle correctly is when `l` is greater than `r`. In this case, the function `func_1` will return an incorrect result because it does not check if `l` is greater than `r` before calculating the count. 

Another case that the code does not handle correctly is when `k` is greater than 10. In this case, the function `count` will not work correctly because it uses a dictionary `dp` to store intermediate results, but it does not handle the case where `k` is greater than 10.

Additionally, the function `count` does not handle the case where `n` is a negative number. In this case, the function will not work correctly because it uses the modulo operator to calculate the remainder of `dp[n, k]` divided by `MOD`, but the modulo operator does not work correctly with negative numbers.

The annotations provided with the code do mention some of these edge cases, but they do not provide a complete solution to handle these cases. 

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and it is incorrect.
