The value of `dp[n, k]` is modified by taking the modulus of `dp[n, k]` with `MOD`. The initial value of `dp[n, k]` is 9 if `k` is 0 or 1, otherwise it is 9 + 9 * (10^1 - 1) + 9 * 10^1 * (10^2 - 10^1) +... + 9 * 10^(k-2) * (10^(k-1) - 10^(k-2)) + 9 * 10^k. 

However, the value of `MOD` is not provided. Therefore, the output state is `dp[n, k]` is the remainder of the initial value of `dp[n, k]` divided by `MOD`.

Output State: **`dp[n, k]` is the remainder of the initial value of `dp[n, k]` divided by `MOD`.**
