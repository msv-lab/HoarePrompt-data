The function returns `total_sum`, which is the sum of all numbers in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(num, k)` is true, taken modulo `MOD`. The value of `num` is `r` after the loop executes. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `l` is either less than or equal to `r` or greater than `r`, `num` is `r`, and the function returns the sum of all numbers in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(num, k)` is true, taken modulo `MOD`.

Output State: **`l` is either less than or equal to `r` or greater than `r`, `num` is `r`, and the function returns the sum of all numbers in the range `[l, r]` for which `func_1(num, k)` is true, taken modulo `MOD`.**
