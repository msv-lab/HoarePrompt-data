Correctness: **True**

I have carefully reviewed the code, annotations, and problem description, and I believe the code meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.

The code checks three conditions:

1. If `b` equals `a`, it prints 'YES'.
2. If `c` is zero, it prints 'NO'.
3. If the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The annotations provide additional context and examples, but they do not reveal any cases where the code does not follow the problem description. In fact, the annotations suggest that the code covers all possible cases, including when `c` is zero, the difference between `b` and `a` is not divisible by `c`, or the result of the division is negative.

I have also checked the examples provided in the problem description, and the code produces the correct output for all of them.

One potential concern was the annotation's comment about the case where `c` is zero and the difference between `b` and `a` is not divisible by `c`. However, upon closer inspection, I realized that this case is indeed covered by the code, which prints 'NO' when `c` is zero.

Overall, I believe the code is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
