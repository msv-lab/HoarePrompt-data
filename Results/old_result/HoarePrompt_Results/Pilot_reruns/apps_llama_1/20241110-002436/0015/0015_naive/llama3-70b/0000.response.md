Correctness: **True**.

I have analyzed the program and it seems to correctly implement the logic to determine if a given number `b` appears in an arithmetic sequence with first term `a` and common difference `c`. 

The program handles the case where `c` is 0 correctly, in which case `b` is in the sequence only if `a` is equal to `b`. 

When `c` is not 0, the program checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is a multiple of `c` and if the result of the division is non-negative. This is correct because the sequence will contain `b` if and only if `b` is equal to `a` plus a non-negative multiple of `c`.

I have not been able to find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, and all the examples provided in the problem description are correctly handled by the program. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
