Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. It checks if `b` is equal to `a`, if `c` is zero, and if the difference between `b` and `a` is a non-negative multiple of `c`. These conditions seem to cover all the possible cases.

However, after re-reading the problem description, I noticed that the sequence `s` is defined as `s_i = s_{i-1} + c` for all `i > 1`, which means that the sequence is increasing if `c` is positive and decreasing if `c` is negative. This implies that if `b` is less than `a` and `c` is positive, or if `b` is greater than `a` and `c` is negative, then `b` cannot be in the sequence.

The code does not explicitly check for these cases, but it does check if `(b - a) / c >= 0`, which is equivalent to checking if `b` is greater than or equal to `a` when `c` is positive, and if `b` is less than or equal to `a` when `c` is negative. Therefore, the code seems to be correct.

The output hints agree with the code and do not provide any additional information that would suggest the code is incorrect.

After analyzing the code and the problem description, I conclude that:

Correctness: **True**

The code correctly checks if `b` is in the sequence `s` by checking if `b` is equal to `a`, if `c` is zero, and if the difference between `b` and `a` is a non-negative multiple of `c`. The code also implicitly checks for the cases where `b` is less than `a` and `c` is positive, or if `b` is greater than `a` and `c` is negative, by checking if `(b - a) / c >= 0`.
