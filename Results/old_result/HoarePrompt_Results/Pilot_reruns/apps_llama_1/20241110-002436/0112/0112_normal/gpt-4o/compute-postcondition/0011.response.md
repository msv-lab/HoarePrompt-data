The value of `found` is changed to `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of lists of 6 integers each, `digits` is a list of at least 1 character representing the digits of `num`, `k` is at least 1, `used_cubes` is a list with `used_cubes[i]` set to `True`, `found` is `True`, `i` is at least 1.
