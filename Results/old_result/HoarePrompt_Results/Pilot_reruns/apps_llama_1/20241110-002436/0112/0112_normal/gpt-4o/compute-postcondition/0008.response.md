Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of lists of 6 integers each, `digits` is a list of at least 1 character representing the digits of `num`, `k` is at least 1. If the `i-th` cube is not used and the first digit of `digits` is in the faces of the `i-th` cube, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, `found` is set to `True`, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
