Let's think step by step: List the impact of the code on the program, check the previous values of the affected variables, and then calculate the result.

The code creates a new list `used_cubes` with `n` elements, all initialized to `False`. This does not affect the values of `n`, `cube_faces`, or `digits`.

The value of `n` is still a positive integer, `cube_faces` is still a list of lists of 6 integers each, and `digits` is still a list of `k` characters representing the digits of `num`. Additionally, a new list `used_cubes` is created with `n` elements, all initialized to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of lists of 6 integers each, `digits` is a list of `k` characters representing the digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` boolean values, all `False`.**
