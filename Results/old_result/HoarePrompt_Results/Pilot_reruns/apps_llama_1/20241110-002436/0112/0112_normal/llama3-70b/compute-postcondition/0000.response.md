`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state of `n` is overridden by the new input value. The state of `cubes` is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of 6 integers between 0 and 9 (inclusive) for each of the previous value of n cubes**
