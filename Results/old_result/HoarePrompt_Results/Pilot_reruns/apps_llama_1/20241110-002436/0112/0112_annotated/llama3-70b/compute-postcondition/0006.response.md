The code updates the `digits` set with the string representations of the digits in the `cube` list. Since `cube` is the second sublist in `cubes` and `digits` already contains the string representations of the digits in the second sublist of `cubes`, the update operation will not add any new elements to the `digits` set if the second sublist has not changed.

However, if the second sublist has changed, the `digits` set will be updated with the string representations of the digits in the new second sublist.

The `cubes` list and the `cube` variable are not modified by this code.

Output State: **`cubes` is a list of `n` lists of integers with `n` is either 2 or 3 and has at least 2 sublists, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the second sublist of `cubes`, `cube` is the second sublist in `cubes`.**
