To determine the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
used_cubes[i] = True
```
From the initial state, we know that:
- `n` is 3
- `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers
- `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`
- `i` is 2
- `used_cubes` is either `[True, True, False]` or `[True, False, True]`
- `found` is True

The code affects the `used_cubes` list by setting the value at index `i` to `True`. Since `i` is 2, we will update the third element of the `used_cubes` list.

If `used_cubes` is initially `[True, True, False]`, it will become `[True, True, True]`.

If `used_cubes` is initially `[True, False, True]`, it will become `[True, False, True]`, which does not change.

The other variables are not affected by this code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is 3
- `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers
- `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`
- `i` is 2
- `used_cubes` is either `[True, True, True]` or `[True, False, True]`
- `found` is True

Output State: **`n` is 3; `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers; `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`; `i` is 2; `used_cubes` is either `[True, True, True]` or `[True, False, True]`; `found` is True**
