The provided code snippet is incomplete, as it references a variable `num` that is not defined in the initial state. However, based on the context, I will assume that `num` is an integer.

The code `digits = list(str(num))` converts the integer `num` to a string and then to a list of characters.

Since `num` is not defined in the initial state, I will assume it is a variable that holds an integer value. The output state will be:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers, where each integer is between 0 and 9, inclusive, and `digits` is a list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`.**
