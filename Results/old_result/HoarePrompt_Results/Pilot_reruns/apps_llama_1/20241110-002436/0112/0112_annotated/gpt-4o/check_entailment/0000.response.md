Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that Masha can rotate her cubes and put them in a row to form a number, but the code does not handle the rotation of cubes correctly.

The function `can_form_number` checks if a number can be formed by checking if each digit of the number is present in any of the cube faces. However, it does not consider the rotation of cubes. For example, if a cube has the faces [0, 1, 2, 3, 4, 5] and the number to be formed is 6, the function will return False because 6 is not present in any of the cube faces. However, the cube can be rotated to form the digit 6.

Additionally, the code does not handle the case where the number to be formed has a leading zero. The problem description states that the number cannot contain leading zeros, but the code does not check for this condition.

The annotations also mention some cases that are not handled by the code, such as when `n` is negative or when `cube_faces` is empty or invalid. However, these cases are not explicitly handled by the code.

Overall, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, and therefore, the correctness is **False**.
