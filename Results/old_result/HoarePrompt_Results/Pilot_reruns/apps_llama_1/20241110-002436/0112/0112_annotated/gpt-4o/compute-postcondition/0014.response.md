To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop statement is `for i in range(n):`. This indicates that the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have the following states:

- `n` is an integer such that 1 < n <= 3.
- `i` is 1.
- Other states (`cube_faces`, `digits`, `num`, `used_cubes`, `found`) are also given, but they do not affect the loop condition.

Since `i` is 1 and `n` is either 2 or 3, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be 3 (because if `n` is 2, the loop will terminate after the current iteration). 

Additionally, since `i` is 1, it needs to be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.

The other states (`cube_faces`, `digits`, `num`, `used_cubes`, `found`) do not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is 3; `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers; `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`; `i` is 2; `used_cubes` is either `[True, True, False]` or `[True, False, True]`; `found` is True.**
