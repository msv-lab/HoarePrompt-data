Postcondition: ***`n` is 3; `cube_faces` is a list of 6-element lists of integers; `digits` is a non-empty list of characters representing the digits of the integer `num`; `i` is 2. If the cube at index `i` is not used and the digit is found in the cube's faces, then `used_cubes` is updated to mark the cube as used, `found` is set to True, and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged, with `used_cubes` being either `[True, True, False]` or `[True, False, True]`, and `found` being True.***
