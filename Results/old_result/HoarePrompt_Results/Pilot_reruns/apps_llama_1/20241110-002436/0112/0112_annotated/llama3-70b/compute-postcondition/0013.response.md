To calculate the output state, let's break down the given code step by step.

1. `sorted(digits, reverse=True)`: This expression sorts the elements in the `digits` set in descending order. Since `digits` contains unique string representations of digits, this will arrange the digits from highest to lowest.

2. `''.join(...)`: This expression concatenates the sorted digits into a single string, effectively creating the largest possible number that can be formed using the digits in `digits`.

3. `int(...)`: This expression converts the resulting string into an integer.

The variable `max_num` is assigned the value of this integer.

Since the initial state of `digits` is a set containing unique string representations of digits (excluding '0' if present), the output state will be the maximum possible integer that can be formed using these digits.

Output State: **`max_num` is the maximum possible integer formed using the unique digits in `cubes`, `digits` remains unchanged.**
