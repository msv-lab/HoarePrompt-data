Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The program correctly determines the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote. It calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used based on the available fruits and the required ratio. The minimum number of lemons is then used to calculate the total number of fruits that can be used.

The program correctly handles the cases where Nikolay does not have enough fruits to cook the compote, as shown in the third example. In this case, the program outputs 0, which is the correct answer.

The program also correctly handles the cases where Nikolay has enough fruits to cook the compote, as shown in the first and second examples. In these cases, the program outputs the correct total number of fruits that can be used.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
