Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code `b = int(input())` assigns a new value to `b`. The previous value of `b` is a positive integer, but it is overwritten by the new value. The new value of `b` is an input integer, which means it can be any integer value.

The value of `a` is not affected by this code, so it remains an input integer.

The value of `c` is also not affected by this code, so it remains a positive integer.

Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer**
