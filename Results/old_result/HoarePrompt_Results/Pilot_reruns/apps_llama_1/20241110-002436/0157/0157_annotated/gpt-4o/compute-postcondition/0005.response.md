The code prints the value of `total_fruits`, which is 7 times the value of `max_lemons`. The value of `max_lemons` is the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, the output state will depend on their values. However, we can express the output state in terms of the input variables.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, `total_fruits` is 7 times the value of `max_lemons`, and the function prints 7 times the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.**
