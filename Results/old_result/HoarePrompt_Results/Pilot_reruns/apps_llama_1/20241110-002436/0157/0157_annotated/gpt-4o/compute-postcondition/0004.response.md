Let's analyze the code step by step:

1. `total_fruits` is assigned a new value based on the existing value of `max_lemons`.
2. The value of `max_lemons` is the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
3. Since `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, their values are not changed by this code.
4. The value of `total_fruits` is calculated as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `7 * max_lemons`.

Since `max_lemons` is the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, the value of `total_fruits` is 7 times this minimum value.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and `total_fruits` is 7 times the value of `max_lemons`.**
