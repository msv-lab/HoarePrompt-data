Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The function `func` does not accept any parameters, but it takes three integer inputs from the user: `a`, `b`, and `c`.
2. The function calculates the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4` and assigns it to `min_lemon`.
3. The function then prints the value of `min_lemon * 7`.

Based on the code, the functionality of the function is to calculate the minimum value among the input integers `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and then print the result multiplied by 7.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic:

* The annotations mention that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers, but the code does not validate this. If the user enters a non-positive integer or a non-integer value, the function may produce incorrect results or raise an error.
* The function does not handle the case where the user enters a very large integer value, which could cause an overflow error when calculating `min_lemon * 7`.

Taking these potential edge cases into account, the functionality of the function can be summarized as:

Functionality: ** The function takes three integer inputs from the user, calculates the minimum value among the input integers `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and prints the result multiplied by 7, assuming the inputs are positive integers and do not cause an overflow error. **
