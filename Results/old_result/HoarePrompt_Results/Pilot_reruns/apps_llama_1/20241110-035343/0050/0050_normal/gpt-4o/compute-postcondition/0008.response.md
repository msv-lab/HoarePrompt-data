To determine the output state, we'll go through the code step by step.

1. `total_bourles` is assigned the value of `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`.
2. `max_shares` is `r` divided by the minimum integer in `s` (integer division).
3. `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by the minimum integer in `s`.
4. `max_sell_price` is the maximum integer in `b`.

Since we don't know the exact values of `r`, `s`, and `b`, we'll express the output state in terms of these variables.

Let's assume the minimum integer in `s` is `min_s`, and the maximum integer in `b` is `max_b`.

Then, `max_shares` is `r // min_s` (integer division), and `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_s`.

So, `total_bourles` is `(r // min_s) * max_b + (r % min_s)`.

The output state is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum integer in `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum integer in `b`, `max_shares` is `r` divided by the minimum integer in `s` (integer division), `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by the minimum integer in `s`, and `total_bourles` is `(r // min_s) * max_b + (r % min_s)`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum integer in `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum integer in `b`, `max_shares` is `r` divided by the minimum integer in `s` (integer division), `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by the minimum integer in `s`, and `total_bourles` is `(r // min_s) * max_b + (r % min_s)`**
