Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are input integers, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum integer in `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum integer in `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, the function calculates `max_shares` as `r` divided by `min_buy_price` (integer division), `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` as `(r // min_buy_price) * max_sell_price + (r % min_buy_price)`, and prints the value of `total_bourles`.***
