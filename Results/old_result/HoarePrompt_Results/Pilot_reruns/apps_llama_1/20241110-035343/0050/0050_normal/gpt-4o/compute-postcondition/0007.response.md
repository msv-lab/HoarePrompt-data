Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code calculates the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price` and assigns it to `remaining_bourles`. 

The value of `r` is an input integer, and `min_buy_price` is the minimum integer in `s`, which is a list of input integers.

The other variables are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum integer in `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum integer in `b`, `max_shares` is `r` divided by the minimum integer in `s` (integer division), and `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by the minimum integer in `s`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum integer in `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum integer in `b`, `max_shares` is `r` divided by the minimum integer in `s` (integer division), and `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by the minimum integer in `s`.**
