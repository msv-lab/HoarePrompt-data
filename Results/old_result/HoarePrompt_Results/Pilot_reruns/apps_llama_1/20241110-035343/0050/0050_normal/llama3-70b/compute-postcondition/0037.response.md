Postcondition: ***`n` is 0 or greater than 0, `m` is greater than 1, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order, `i` is 1. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, leaving all variables unchanged.***
