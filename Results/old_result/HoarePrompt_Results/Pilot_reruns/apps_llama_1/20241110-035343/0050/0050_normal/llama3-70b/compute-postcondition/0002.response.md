The code `b = list(map(int, input().split()))` assigns a new value to `b`. The `input().split()` function splits the input string into a list of strings, and `map(int,...)` converts each string in the list to an integer. The result is a list of integers, which is assigned to `b`.

The initial state of `b` is a list of `m` positive integers, but this is overwritten by the new value. The other variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `m` is an input positive integer, `r` is an input positive integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers**
