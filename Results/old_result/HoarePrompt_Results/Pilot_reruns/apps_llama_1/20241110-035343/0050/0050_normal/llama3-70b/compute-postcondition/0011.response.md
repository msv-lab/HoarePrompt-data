To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `i in range(n)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is at least 1. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the loop condition only depends on `i` and `n`.

State: **`n` is at least 1, `m` is an input positive integer, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers in descending order, `i` is 1**
