The given Python code is executed, and its impact on the program is as follows:

`s` is reassigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which accepts an input, splits it into a list of strings, converts each string to an integer, and returns the list of integers. The previous value of `s` is discarded. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `b` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of m positive integers**
