The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop of if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `r` is greater than 0, `shares` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `m` is greater than 0, `s` is a sorted list of stock prices, `b` is unchanged, `i` is 0 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
