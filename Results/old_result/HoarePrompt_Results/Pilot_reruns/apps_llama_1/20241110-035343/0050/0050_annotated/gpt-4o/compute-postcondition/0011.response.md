Based on the provided information, I will describe the functionality of the function.

The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b`. `n` and `m` are positive integers, `r` is a positive integer, `s` is a list of `n` positive integers, and `b` is a list of `m` positive integers.

However, I don't see any information about the output of the function. Could you please provide the output details, such as the return value(s) and any conditions that affect the return value(s)? This will allow me to complete the functionality description.

Please provide the output information, and I'll be happy to help.
