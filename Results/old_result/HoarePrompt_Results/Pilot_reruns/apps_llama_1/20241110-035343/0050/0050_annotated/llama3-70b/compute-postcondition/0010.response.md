Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `m` is an input integer between 1 and 30, `s` is a sorted list of input integers, `b` is a list of `m` input integers in descending order. If `r` is greater than or equal to the first element of `s`, `shares` is increased by `r // s[0]`, and `r` is updated to be the remainder of `r` divided by `s[0]`. Otherwise, the loop or if statement is exited, leaving `r` unchanged, and `shares` remains 0, and `i` remains 0.***
