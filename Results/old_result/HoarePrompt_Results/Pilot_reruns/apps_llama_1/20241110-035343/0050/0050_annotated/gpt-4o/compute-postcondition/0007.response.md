Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code calculates the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price` and assigns it to a new variable `remaining_bourles`.

Since `r` is an input integer and `min_buy_price` is the smallest integer in `s`, we can't determine the exact value of `remaining_bourles` without knowing the input values. However, we can express it in terms of the initial state.

The value of `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`, which is equivalent to `r % min_buy_price`.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `min_buy_price` is the smallest integer in `s`, `max_sell_price` is the largest integer in `b`, `max_shares` is `r` divided by `min_buy_price` (integer division), and `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of input integers, `b` is a list of input integers, `min_buy_price` is the smallest integer in `s`, `max_sell_price` is the largest integer in `b`, `max_shares` is `r` divided by `min_buy_price` (integer division), and `remaining_bourles` is `r % min_buy_price**
