Correctness: **True**

The provided program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. Here's why:

1. The program correctly reads two very long integers `a` and `b` from the input, allowing for leading zeroes.
2. It removes leading zeroes from both numbers using the `lstrip('0')` method, which is correct because leading zeroes do not affect the value of the number.
3. If a number becomes empty after removing leading zeroes (i.e., it was a string of zeroes), the program sets it to '0', which is correct.
4. The program then compares the lengths of the two numbers. If one number has more digits than the other, it correctly prints '<' or '>' depending on which number is longer.
5. If the numbers have the same length, the program compares them lexicographically using the `<` and `>` operators. This is correct because the numbers are represented as strings, and the lexicographic comparison is equivalent to a numerical comparison for numbers with the same number of digits.
6. If the numbers are equal, the program prints '='.

The program correctly handles all possible cases, including:

* Numbers with leading zeroes
* Numbers with different lengths
* Numbers with the same length
* Numbers that are equal

The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly handled by the program.

Overall, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
