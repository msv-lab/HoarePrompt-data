The function takes two input strings from the user, removes leading zeroes, and compares them lexicographically. It prints '=' if the strings are equal, '<' if the first string is lexicographically less than the second, and '>' otherwise. However, the function does not handle non-numeric input, strings of different lengths, or empty input, which may produce unexpected results.
