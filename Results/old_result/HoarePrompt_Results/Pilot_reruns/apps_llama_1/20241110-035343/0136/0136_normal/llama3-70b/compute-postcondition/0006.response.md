Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are input strings with leading zeroes removed. After the comparison, either '=' is printed if `a` is equal to `b`, '<' is printed if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, or '>' is printed if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, covering all possible string comparisons including equal, less than, and greater than cases.***
