The code `b = data[1].lstrip('0')` removes leading zeroes from the string `data[1]` and assigns the result to `b`. The value of `a` is not affected.

Since `a` is the string `data[0]` with leading zeroes removed, and `b` is a string representing a non-negative integer with no more than 10^6 digits, possibly with leading zeroes, after the execution of the code, `a` remains the same, and `b` becomes the string `data[1]` with leading zeroes removed.

Output State: **`a` is the string `data[0]` with leading zeroes removed, `b` is the string `data[1]` with leading zeroes removed, `data` is a list of two input strings**
