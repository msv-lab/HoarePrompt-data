The code `print('<')` prints the character '<' to the console. This statement does not affect the state of the variables `a`, `b`, or `data`.

Output State: **`a` is the string `data[0]` with leading zeroes removed, or '0' if it was initially an empty string, `b` is the string `data[1]` with leading zeroes removed, or '0' if it was initially an empty string, `data` is a list of two input strings, and '<' is printed to the console.**
