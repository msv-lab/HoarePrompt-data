Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func` accepts no parameters, but it takes two input strings from the user using the `input()` function. The input strings are stored in variables `a` and `b`, and leading zeroes are removed from both strings using the `lstrip('0')` method.

The function then compares the two input strings lexicographically using the `<` and `>` operators. If the strings are equal, it prints `=`. If `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, it prints `<`. Otherwise, it prints `>`.

Now, let's look at the potential edge cases and missing logic:

* The function does not handle the case where the input strings are not numeric. If the user enters a non-numeric string, the comparison may not work as expected.
* The function does not handle the case where the input strings have different lengths. If one string is a prefix of the other, the comparison may not work as expected.
* The function does not handle the case where the input strings are empty. If the user enters an empty string, the function may raise an error or produce unexpected results.

Considering these potential edge cases and missing logic, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function takes two input strings from the user, removes leading zeroes, and compares them lexicographically. It prints '=' if the strings are equal, '<' if the first string is lexicographically less than the second, and '>' otherwise. However, the function does not handle non-numeric input, strings of different lengths, or empty input, which may produce unexpected results. **
