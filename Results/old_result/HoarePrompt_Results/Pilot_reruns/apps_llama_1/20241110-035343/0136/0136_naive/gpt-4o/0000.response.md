Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly compares two very large integers a and b. Here's why:

1. The program reads the input using `sys.stdin.read()`, which is efficient for large inputs.
2. It splits the input into two strings `a` and `b` using `input().split()`.
3. It removes leading zeroes from both `a` and `b` using `lstrip('0')`. If the resulting string is empty, it sets the string to '0'.
4. It compares the lengths of `a` and `b`. If `a` is shorter than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is longer than `b`, it prints '>'.
5. If the lengths are equal, it compares the strings lexicographically. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. If they are equal, it prints '='.

The program handles all possible cases correctly:

* If `a` and `b` have different lengths, it prints the correct comparison symbol.
* If `a` and `b` have the same length, it compares them lexicographically.
* If `a` or `b` has leading zeroes, it removes them correctly.
* If `a` or `b` is zero, it handles it correctly.

I couldn't find any case where the program doesn't work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
