Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the input numbers may contain leading zeroes, but it does not mention that the input must be numeric or cannot contain non-digit characters. However, the code assumes that the input is numeric and does not handle cases where the input contains non-digit characters.

The annotations mention that the function does not handle cases where the input strings are not numeric or contain non-digit characters, which is correct. This suggests that the code is not robust enough to handle all possible inputs.

For example, if the input is "123abc" and "456", the code will not work correctly because it will try to compare the strings lexicographically, which will not give the correct result.

The annotations also mention that the function does not provide any output or return value if the input strings are not valid numbers. This is another case where the code does not follow the problem description, which expects the program to print "<", ">", or "=" for any two input numbers.

Overall, the code does not handle all possible inputs and does not provide the correct output for non-numeric inputs, which makes it incorrect.
