The code `print('<')` prints the string '<' to the console. This operation does not affect the values of `a` and `b`. Therefore, the output state is `a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is a new input string with leading zeroes removed, and '<' is printed.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is a new input string with leading zeroes removed, and '<' is printed.**
