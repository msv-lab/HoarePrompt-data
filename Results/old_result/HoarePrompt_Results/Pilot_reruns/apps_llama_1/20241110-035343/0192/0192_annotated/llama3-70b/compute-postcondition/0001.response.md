The code calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using the `abs` function and prints the result. The values of `x` and `y` are input integers, so the absolute difference is also an integer. The output state is the same as the initial state, with the additional information that the absolute difference between `x` and `y` is printed.

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, and the absolute difference between `x` and `y` is printed**
