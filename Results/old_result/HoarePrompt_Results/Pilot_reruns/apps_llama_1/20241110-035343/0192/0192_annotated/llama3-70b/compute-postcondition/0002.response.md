Based on the provided information, I will describe the functionality of the function.


The function `func` accepts two parameters, `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, and they satisfy the condition 3 <= y < x <= 100000. However, since the function definition is `def func():`, it does not explicitly accept any parameters. This is likely an error, and the function definition should be `def func(x, y):` to match the provided parameter constraints.


Assuming the corrected function definition, the functionality of the function `func` is to accept two integer parameters `x` and `y`, where 3 <= y < x <= 100000.


However, since the output section is empty, I will not provide any information about the return value. If you provide the output details, I will be happy to complete the functionality description.


Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters x and y, where 3 <= y < x <= 100000.**
