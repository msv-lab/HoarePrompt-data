Let's think step by step:

The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` reads two integers from the input and assigns them to `x` and `y`. The `map(int, input().split())` part splits the input into two parts, converts each part to an integer using `int()`, and returns a map object containing the two integers. The `x, y =` part unpacks the map object and assigns the two integers to `x` and `y`.

Since the initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 <= y < x <= 100000`, the values of `x` and `y` are overwritten by the input values.

The output state is: `x` and `y` are input integers such that `x` and `y` are not necessarily in the range `3 <= y < x <= 100000`.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are input integers**
