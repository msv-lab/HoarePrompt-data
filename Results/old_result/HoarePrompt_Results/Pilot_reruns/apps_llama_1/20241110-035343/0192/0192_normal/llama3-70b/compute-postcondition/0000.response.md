The code `x, y = map(int, input().split())` assigns new values to `x` and `y` based on the input. The `input()` function accepts a string of space-separated integers, and `split()` splits the string into a list of strings. The `map(int,...)` function converts each string in the list to an integer.

Since the initial state specifies that `x` and `y` are integers such that `3 <= y < x <= 100,000`, the new values of `x` and `y` will also be integers. However, the specific values of `x` and `y` will depend on the input provided.

Therefore, the output state is: `x` and `y` are input integers.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are input integers**
