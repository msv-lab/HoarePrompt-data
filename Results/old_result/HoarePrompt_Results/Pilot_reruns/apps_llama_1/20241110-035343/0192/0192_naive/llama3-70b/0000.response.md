Correctness: **False**.

The program does not work correctly for all cases. For example, if the input is 10 7, the program will output 3, but the correct answer is 4. The correct sequence of operations would be (10,10,10) -> (10,10,7) -> (10,8,7) -> (7,8,7) -> (7,7,7).

The program only considers the absolute difference between x and y, but it does not take into account the fact that the triangle must remain non-degenerate at all times. In this case, the program's output is incorrect because it does not consider the additional step required to make the triangle non-degenerate.

A correct solution would involve considering the maximum and minimum possible values for each side of the triangle at each step, and ensuring that the triangle remains non-degenerate. This would require a more complex algorithm than simply taking the absolute difference between x and y.
