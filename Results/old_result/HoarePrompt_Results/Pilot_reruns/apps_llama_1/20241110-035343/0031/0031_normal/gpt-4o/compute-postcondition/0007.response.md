To ensure the loop can execute, we need to adjust the states as follows:

According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `k`. Since `k` is already an integer >= 2, it is guaranteed that the loop will execute at least once. However, to make the loop execute, we need to adjust the state of `i`, which is the loop counter.

State: **`n` is an integer >= 1, `k` is an integer >= 2, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is `2^n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**

Note that we set `i` to 0, which is the initial value of the loop counter in the `range(k)` function. This ensures that the loop will execute for the first iteration.
