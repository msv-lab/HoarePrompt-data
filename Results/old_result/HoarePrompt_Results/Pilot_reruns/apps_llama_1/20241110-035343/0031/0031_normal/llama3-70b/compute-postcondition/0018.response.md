The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers within specific ranges: 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 2 <= k <= 10^18.

After executing the function body, the function returns a tuple containing three values: `numerator`, `denominator`, and `gcd`. 

However, it seems like the output description is incomplete and doesn't follow the format of having multiple return points in the function split into cases. 

Assuming the output description is correct and there's only one return point, the functionality of the function func_1 can be described as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, n and k, which are integers within specific ranges, and returns a tuple containing the result of a calculation involving the product of (2^n - i) for i from 0 to k-1, 2 raised to the power of n*k, and their greatest common divisor, all modulo 10^9 + 7.**
