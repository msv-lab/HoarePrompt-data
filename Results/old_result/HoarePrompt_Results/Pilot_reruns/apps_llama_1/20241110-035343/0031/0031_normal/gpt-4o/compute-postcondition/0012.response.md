The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days` and taking the modulus `MOD`. The previous value of `denominator` is `2^n` % 1000003 and `total_days` is `2^n`.

`denominator` is updated to (`2^n` % 1000003) * `2^n` % 1000003.

Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `n` is an integer >= 1, `k` is an integer >= 2, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is `2^n`, `numerator` is ((`2^n` % 1000003) * (`2^n` - 1)) % 1000003, `denominator` is (`2^n` % 1000003) * `2^n` % 1000003, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer >= 1, `k` is an integer >= 2, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is `2^n`, `numerator` is ((`2^n` % 1000003) * (`2^n` - 1)) % 1000003, `denominator` is (`2^n` % 1000003) * `2^n` % 1000003, `i` is 1**
