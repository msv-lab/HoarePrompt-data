The function returns a tuple of two values: `numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3)` and `denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)`. The values of `numerator` and `denominator` are taken from the initial state, and the modulo operation is applied to each of them. The value of `gcd` is not affected by this operation.

Since the values of `numerator` and `denominator` are already calculated and we do not know their exact values, we can only describe the output as the remainder of the division of `numerator` and `denominator` by `(10 ** 6 + 3)`. 

The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `numerator` is the product of `(2^n - i)` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, `denominator` is `2` raised to the power of `n*k` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, and the function returns a tuple of `numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3)` and `denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)`.

Output State: **`numerator` is the product of `(2^n - i)` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, `denominator` is `2` raised to the power of `n*k` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, and the function returns a tuple of `numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3)` and `denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)`.**
