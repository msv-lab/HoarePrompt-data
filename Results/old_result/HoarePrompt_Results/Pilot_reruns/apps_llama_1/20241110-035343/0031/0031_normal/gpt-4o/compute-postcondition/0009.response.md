To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

The code snippet is:
```
denominator = denominator * total_days % MOD
```
From the initial state, we know:
- `n` is an integer >= 1
- `k` is an integer >= 2
- `MOD` is 1000003
- `total_days` is `2^n`
- `numerator` is `2^n` % 1000003
- `denominator` is 1
- `i` is 0

Now, let's calculate the new value of `denominator`:
- `denominator` is initially 1
- `total_days` is `2^n`
- `MOD` is 1000003

So, `denominator` becomes:
```
denominator = 1 * 2^n % 1000003
```
Since `numerator` is `2^n` % 1000003, we can say that `denominator` is now equal to `numerator`.

The output state is:
- `n` is an integer >= 1
- `k` is an integer >= 2
- `MOD` is 1000003
- `total_days` is `2^n`
- `numerator` is `2^n` % 1000003
- `denominator` is `2^n` % 1000003 (which is equal to `numerator`)
- `i` is 0

Output State: **`n` is an integer >= 1, `k` is an integer >= 2, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is `2^n`, `numerator` is `2^n` % 1000003, `denominator` is `2^n` % 1000003, `i` is 0**
