The value of `numerator` is divided by `gcd` using integer division, which means the result is truncated to an integer. Since `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`, dividing `numerator` by `gcd` will result in an integer.

The values of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is `k-1`, `numerator` is the product of `total_days-i` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` divided by the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`, `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of the original `numerator` and `denominator`.**
