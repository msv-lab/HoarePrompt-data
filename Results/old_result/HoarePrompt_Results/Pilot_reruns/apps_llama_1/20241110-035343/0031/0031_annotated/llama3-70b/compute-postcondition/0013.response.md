Output State: **The loop calculates the numerator and denominator of a fraction where the numerator is the product of `total_days` minus each integer from 0 to `k-1` and the denominator is the product of `total_days` repeated `k` times. If `k` is 0, the loop does not execute and `numerator` and `denominator` remain 1. If `k` is greater than 0, `numerator` is the product of `total_days-i` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` and `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`. `n` remains unchanged throughout the loop. `i` is `k-1` after the loop executes.**

In more detail:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 0
- `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2
- If `k` is 0, `numerator` is 1 and `denominator` is 1
- If `k` is greater than 0, `numerator` is the product of `total_days-i` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` and `denominator` is `total_days` raised to the power of `k`
- `i` is `k-1` after the loop executes
