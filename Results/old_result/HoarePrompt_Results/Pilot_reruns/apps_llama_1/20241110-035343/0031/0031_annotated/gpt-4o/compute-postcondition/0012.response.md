The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days` and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. 

`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, and `denominator` is 2 to the power of `n` modulo 1,000,003. 

So, `denominator` becomes (2 to the power of `n` modulo 1,000,003) * (2 to the power of `n`) modulo 1,000,003.

Using the properties of modular arithmetic, we can simplify this expression to 2 to the power of (2 * `n`) modulo 1,000,003.

The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1, `MOD` is 1,000,003, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is (2 to the power of `n` modulo 1,000,003) * (2 to the power of `n` - 1) modulo 1,000,003, `denominator` is 2 to the power of (2 * `n`) modulo 1,000,003, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1, `MOD` is 1,000,003, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is (2 to the power of `n` modulo 1,000,003) * (2 to the power of `n` - 1) modulo 1,000,003, `denominator` is 2 to the power of (2 * `n`) modulo 1,000,003, `i` is 1**
