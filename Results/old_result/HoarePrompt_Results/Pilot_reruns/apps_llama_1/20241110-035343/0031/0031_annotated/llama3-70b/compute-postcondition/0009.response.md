To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition. The loop is a simple `for` loop that iterates over a range defined by `k`. The loop variable is `i`, and the loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `k`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1
- `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2
- `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2
- `numerator` is `total_days * (total_days - 1)`
- `denominator` is `total_days * total_days`
- `i` is 1

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k`. Since `i` is currently 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 2, the condition is met. However, to ensure the loop executes again, we need to consider what would happen if `i` were incremented (which is what happens at the end of each iteration in a `for` loop).

If `i` is incremented from 1, it becomes 2. For the loop to execute again with `i` as 2, `k` must be greater than 2. Thus, the state of `k` needs to be adjusted to ensure it is greater than 2 to guarantee the loop executes again.

The other variables (`n`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `denominator`) do not affect the loop's condition directly, so their states do not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `numerator` is `total_days * (total_days - 1)`, `denominator` is `total_days * total_days`, and `i` is 2**
