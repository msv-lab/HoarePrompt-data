To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition.

The loop condition is `i in range(k)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is greater than 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented, and `k` needs to be greater than the new value of `i`.

So, the adjusted states are:

* `i` is 3 (incremented from 2)
* `k` is greater than 2 (since `i` is now 3)

The other states (`n`, `MOD`, `total_days`, `numerator`, and `denominator`) are not affected by the loop condition and do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 2, `MOD` is 1,000,003, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is `original_numerator * (2^n - 2) modulo 1,000,003`, `denominator` is 2 to the power of (3 * `n`) modulo 1,000,003, `i` is 3**
