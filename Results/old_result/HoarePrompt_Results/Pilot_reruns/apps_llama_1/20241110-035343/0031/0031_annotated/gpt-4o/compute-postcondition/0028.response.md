Let's break down the code step by step:

1. The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`.
2. The function first checks if `k` is greater than `2` to the power of `n`. If this condition is true, it prints `1, 1` and returns without executing the rest of the code.
3. If the condition is false, the function calculates the total number of days (`total_days`) as `2` to the power of `n`.
4. The function then initializes two variables `numerator` and `denominator` to `1`.
5. The function then enters a loop that runs `k` times. In each iteration, it updates the `numerator` and `denominator` variables using the formulas `numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD` and `denominator = denominator * total_days % MOD`, where `i` is the loop counter.
6. After the loop, the function calculates `p_shared` as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`, where `p_total` is the `denominator` and `p_no_shared` is the `numerator`.
7. The function then calls another function `func_1` with `A` and `B` as arguments, where `A` is `p_shared` and `B` is `p_total`.
8. The function then updates `A` and `B` by dividing them by the return value of `func_1`.
9. Finally, the function prints the values of `A` and `B` modulo `MOD`.

Now, let's analyze the code and identify any potential edge cases or missing logic:

* The function does not handle the case where `n` or `k` is negative. In this case, the function may produce incorrect results or raise an exception.
* The function does not handle the case where `k` is greater than or equal to `MOD`. In this case, the function may produce incorrect results due to the modulo operation.
* The function does not handle the case where `func_1` returns `0`. In this case, the function will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when updating `A` and `B`.

Based on this analysis, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and returns or prints values based on the comparison between `k` and `2` to the power of `n`. If `k` is greater than `2` to the power of `n`, the function prints `1, 1` and returns. Otherwise, the function calculates the total number of days, updates the numerator and denominator variables using a loop, and then calls another function `func_1` to update the values of `A` and `B`. The function finally prints the values of `A` and `B` modulo `MOD`. However, the function does not handle negative values of `n` or `k`, values of `k` greater than or equal to `MOD`, or the case where `func_1` returns `0`.**
