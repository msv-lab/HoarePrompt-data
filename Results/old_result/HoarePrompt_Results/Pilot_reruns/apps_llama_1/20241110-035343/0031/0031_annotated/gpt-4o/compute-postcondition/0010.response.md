To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 1. The value of `k` being greater than 0 is still valid, but to ensure the loop can execute again, `k` should be greater than 1.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than 1, `MOD` is 1,000,003, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 2 to the power of `n` modulo 1,000,003, `denominator` is 2 to the power of `n` modulo 1,000,003, `i` is 1**
