Let's analyze the given code snippet.

The code multiplies the `numerator` by `total_days - i`. We know that `numerator` is initially `total_days * (total_days - 1)`, `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 2.

So, `total_days - i` is `total_days - 2`. 

The new value of `numerator` is `total_days * (total_days - 1) * (total_days - 2)`.

The values of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `numerator` is `total_days * (total_days - 1) * (total_days - 2)`, `denominator` is `total_days * total_days`, and `i` is 2.

Output State: **`n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `k` is an integer greater than 2, `total_days` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `numerator` is `total_days * (total_days - 1) * (total_days - 2)`, `denominator` is `total_days * total_days`, and `i` is 2**
