Based on the provided annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the functionality of the function.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The annotations state that `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `k` is an integer greater than or equal to 2. However, the code does not explicitly check for these conditions, so it's possible that the function may not behave as expected if these conditions are not met.

The function calculates `total_days` as 2 raised to the power of `n`, and then initializes `numerator` and `denominator` to 1. It then enters a loop that runs `k` times, where it calculates the product of `total_days-i` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` and stores it in `numerator`, and calculates the product of `total_days` repeated `k` times and stores it in `denominator`.

After the loop, the function calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `numerator` and `denominator` using the `math.gcd` function, and then divides both `numerator` and `denominator` by the GCD.

Finally, the function returns the remainder of `numerator` divided by 10^6 + 3, and the remainder of `denominator` divided by 10^6 + 3.

Based on the code, I notice that there are some potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If `k` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `numerator` and `denominator` remain 1. However, the function still returns the remainder of `numerator` divided by 10^6 + 3, and the remainder of `denominator` divided by 10^6 + 3, which may not be the expected behavior.
* If `n` is a large integer, the calculation of `total_days` may overflow, leading to incorrect results.
* The function does not handle the case where `numerator` or `denominator` is 0, which may cause a division by zero error.

Taking these potential edge cases and missing logic into account, I would summarize the functionality of the function as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, calculates the product of `total_days-i` for `i` from 0 to `k-1` and the product of `total_days` repeated `k` times, and returns the remainder of the numerator divided by 10^6 + 3 and the remainder of the denominator divided by 10^6 + 3. However, the function may not behave as expected if `k` is 0, `n` is a large integer, or if `numerator` or `denominator` is 0. **
