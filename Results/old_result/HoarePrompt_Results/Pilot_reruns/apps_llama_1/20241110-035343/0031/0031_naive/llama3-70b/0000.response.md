Correctness: **False**.

The issue with the given program is that it calculates the probability of all k people having different birthdays, and then returns the numerator and denominator of this probability. However, the problem statement asks for the probability of at least two people having the same birthday.

To calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday, we need to subtract the probability of all k people having different birthdays from 1.

Here is a corrected version of the program:

```python
import math

def func_1(n, k):
    total_days = 2 ** n
    numerator = 1
    denominator = 1
    for i in range(k):
        numerator *= total_days - i
        denominator *= total_days
    gcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)
    numerator //= gcd
    denominator //= gcd
    # Calculate the probability of at least two people having the same birthday
    numerator = (denominator - numerator) % (10 ** 6 + 3)
    return (numerator, denominator)

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
(A, B) = func_1(n, k)
print(A, B)
```

In this corrected version, we subtract the numerator from the denominator to get the probability of at least two people having the same birthday, and then take the result modulo 10^6 + 3.
