According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the old value of `a`, and `a` is the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`. 

To ensure the loop can execute again, `b` must not be zero. Since `b` is the old value of `a`, we need to make sure that the old value of `a` is not zero. 

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `a` is the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`, and `b` is the old value of `a` and the old value of `a` is not zero**
