The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` is executed.

The value of `a` is updated to the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`, which is the current value of `b`. 

The value of `b` is updated to the old value of `a`.

Since `a` is the remainder of the old value of `a` divided by the old value of `b`, and `b` is the old value of `a`, we can conclude that the new value of `a` is the remainder of the new value of `b` divided by the old value of `b`.

The values of `n` and `k` are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers, `a` is the remainder of the new value of `b` divided by the old value of `b`, and `b` is the old value of `a`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `a` is the remainder of the new value of `b` divided by the old value of `b`, and `b` is the old value of `a`.**
