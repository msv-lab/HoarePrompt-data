The code `remainder -= 1` decrements the value of `remainder` by 1. The previous value of `remainder` was the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` minus 2. Therefore, the new value of `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` minus 3.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` minus 3, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 2` integers are `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k - 2`, the element at index `k - 2` is `d * (k - 1) + 1`, the element at index `k - 3` is `d * (k - 2) + 1`, and the last integer is `d * k + 1`, `i` is `k - 3**
