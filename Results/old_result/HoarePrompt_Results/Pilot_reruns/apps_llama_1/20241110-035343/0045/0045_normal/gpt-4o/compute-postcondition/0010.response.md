To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state.

The initial state is as follows:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`.
- `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`.
- `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 1` integers are `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k - 1`, and the last integer is `d * k + 1`.
- `i` is `k - 1`.

The given code is:
```
remainder -= 1
```

Now, let's think step by step:
- The value of `remainder` is decremented by 1.
- Since `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`, its value is already between 0 (inclusive) and `min_sum` (exclusive).
- If `remainder` was 0 before the decrement, it becomes -1 after the decrement.
- If `remainder` was greater than 0 before the decrement, it remains positive after the decrement.

The states of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `sequence`, and `i`) are not affected by the given code.

Therefore, the output state is:
- `n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`.
- `k` is a positive integer.
- `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
- `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`.
- `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` minus 1, which can be -1 if the original remainder was 0 or a positive integer less than `min_sum` otherwise.
- `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 1` integers are `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k - 1`, and the last integer is `d * k + 1`.
- `i` is `k - 1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` minus 1, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 1` integers are `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k - 1`, and the last integer is `d * k + 1`, and `i` is `k - 1`.**
