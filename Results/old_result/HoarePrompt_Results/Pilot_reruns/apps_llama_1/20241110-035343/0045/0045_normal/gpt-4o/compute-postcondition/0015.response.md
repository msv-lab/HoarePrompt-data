Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code `remainder -= 1` decrements the value of `remainder` by 1.

From the initial state, we know that `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` minus 1. 

So, after decrementing `remainder` by 1, its new value will be `remainder - 1`.

The values of other variables (`n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `sequence`, and `i`) are not affected by this code.

Therefore, the output state is:

`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`, 
`k` is a positive integer, 
`min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, 
`d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`, 
`remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` minus 2, 
`sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 1` integers are `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k - 1`, the element at index `k - 2` is `d * (k - 1) + 1`, and the last integer is `d * k + 1`, 
and `i` is `k - 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` minus 2, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 1` integers are `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k - 1`, the element at index `k - 2` is `d * (k - 1) + 1`, and the last integer is `d * k + 1`, and `i` is `k - 2`.**
