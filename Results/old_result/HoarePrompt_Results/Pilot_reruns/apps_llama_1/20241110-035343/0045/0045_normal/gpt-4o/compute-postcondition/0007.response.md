Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where each integer is `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k`, `i` is `k - 1`, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
