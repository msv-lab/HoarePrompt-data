The function func_1 accepts two positive integers n and k. According to the annotations, if the minimum sum (k * (k + 1) // 2) is greater than n, it returns -1. Otherwise, it calculates a sequence of k integers based on the values of n and k. 

However, upon closer inspection of the code, we can see that the function does not handle the case where n is not a positive integer or k is not a positive integer. The code also does not handle the case where n is equal to min_sum, in which case the remainder will be 0 and the loop will not execute.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two positive integers n and k, return -1 if the minimum sum is greater than n, and return a list of k integers based on the values of n and k if n is greater than or equal to the minimum sum. If n is not a positive integer or k is not a positive integer, the function's behavior is undefined. If n is equal to min_sum, the function returns a list of k integers where each integer is d times the corresponding integer from 1 to k.

Functionality: ** The function accepts two positive integers n and k, returns -1 if the minimum sum is greater than n, and returns a list of k integers based on the values of n and k if n is greater than or equal to the minimum sum. If n is not a positive integer or k is not a positive integer, the function's behavior is undefined. If n is equal to min_sum, the function returns a list of k integers where each integer is d times the corresponding integer from 1 to k. **
