The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, returns `a` if `b` is 0, otherwise returns the GCD of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function assumes that `a` and `b` are positive integers, but it doesn't check for this case, so its behavior is undefined for non-positive integers or non-integer inputs.
