To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop statement and the current state.

The loop statement is `for i in range(k - 1, -1, -1):`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is `k - 3`. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be decremented by 1, so the new value of `i` should be `k - 4`.

No other states need to be adjusted, as the loop condition only depends on the value of `i` and `k`, and `k` is not changed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to `min_sum`, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is a positive integer representing the quotient of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum` minus 3, `sequence` is a list of `k` integers, where the first `k - 2` integers are `d` times the corresponding integer from 1 to `k - 2`, the element at index `k - 2` is `d * (k - 1) + 1`, the element at index `k - 3` is `d * (k - 2) + 1`, and the last integer is `d * k + 1`, `i` is `k - 4**
