Based on the initial state, the code `return sequence` returns the value of the `sequence` variable.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `k` remains unchanged, `min_sum` remains unchanged, `d` remains unchanged, `remainder` is either 0 or the initial remainder minus `k`, and the function returns `sequence`, which is a list of `k` integers, where each integer is a multiple of `d` plus an additional value that is at most `k - 1` and at least 0, starting from the last element and decreasing by 1 for each element to the left.**
