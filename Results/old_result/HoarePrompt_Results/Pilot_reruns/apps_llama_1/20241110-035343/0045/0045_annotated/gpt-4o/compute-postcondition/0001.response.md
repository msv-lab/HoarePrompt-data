The function returns -1. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and the function returns -1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and the function returns -1**
