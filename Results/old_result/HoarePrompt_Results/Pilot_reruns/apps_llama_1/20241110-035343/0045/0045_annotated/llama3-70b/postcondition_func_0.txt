The function accepts two integer parameters, `a` and `b`, and returns their GCD using the Euclidean algorithm. If `b` is 0 initially, the function returns `a` unchanged. The function does not enforce any constraints on the input values, so its behavior is undefined for non-integer or non-positive inputs. However, if `a` and `b` are integers (positive, negative, or zero), the function will correctly calculate their GCD.
