According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is not zero, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`. This means that `b` can be zero if the original `a` is a multiple of the original `b`. For the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `b` is not zero.

Since `a` is the original value of `b`, and `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`, we can conclude that the original `a` is not a multiple of the original `b`. This means that the original `a` is greater than the original `b`, or the original `a` is not an integer multiple of the original `b`.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that `k <= n`, `a` is the original value of `b` and greater than the original `b`, and `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b` and not equal to zero**
