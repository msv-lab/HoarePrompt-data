The function func_1 accepts two positive integers n and k. 

From the code, we can see that it first calculates the minimum sum (min_sum) that is required to create a sequence of k integers, where each integer is at least 1. If min_sum is greater than n, it returns -1.

If min_sum is not greater than n, it calculates the quotient (d) of n divided by min_sum and the remainder. It then creates a sequence of k integers, where each integer is a multiple of d.

The function then distributes the remainder across the sequence list from right to left by incrementing each element by 1 until the remainder is 0 or the loop iterates k times.

However, there is a potential edge case that is not handled by the annotations. If the remainder is greater than k, the loop will only increment the last k elements of the sequence, and the remaining part of the remainder will be left out.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept two positive integers n and k, and return either -1 if the minimum sum exceeds n, or a sequence of k integers following a specific pattern based on the values of n and k, with the remainder distributed across the sequence list from right to left, but potentially leaving out some part of the remainder if it is greater than k.
