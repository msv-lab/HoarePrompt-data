The function accepts two positive integers n and k, and returns either -1 if the minimum sum exceeds n, or a sequence of k integers following a specific pattern based on the values of n and k, with the remainder distributed across the sequence list from right to left, but potentially leaving out some part of the remainder if it is greater than k.
