To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to consider the loop condition and the variables involved.

The loop condition is `i in range(1, k)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 4, and `k` must be greater than 4 (since `i` is now 4).

The state of `n` and `dp[n, k]` is not affected by the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 4 and less than or equal to 10, `dp[n, k]` is a value in the range of approximately 900 to slightly more than 9 billion, and `i` is 4**
