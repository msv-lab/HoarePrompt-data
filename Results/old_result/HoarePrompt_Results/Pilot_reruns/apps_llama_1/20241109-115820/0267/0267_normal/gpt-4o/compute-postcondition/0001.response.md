To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that make the loop run at least once. The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive), so for the loop to execute, `l` must be less than or equal to `r`. Given that `l` and `r` are already constrained such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, the condition that `l` is less than or equal to `r` is inherently satisfied by the given state. However, to make it explicit and to ensure the loop executes at least once, we need `l` to be strictly less than `r` or `l` to be equal to `r` if we consider the range to include both `l` and `r`.

The variable `num` will take the value of `l` at the start of the loop, and since `k` and `total_sum` do not affect the loop's execution directly based on the provided loop statement, their states remain unchanged. However, it's essential to acknowledge that `num` is introduced as part of the loop's execution state.

State: **`l` is less than or equal to `r`, `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is 0, `num` is `l`**
