The function returns `total_sum`, and `total_sum` stores the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)`, modulo MOD. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are not changed by the return statement. Therefore, the output state is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and the function returns `total_sum`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, and the function returns `total_sum`.**
