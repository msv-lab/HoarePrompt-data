According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10. For the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2, and `k` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 2 to ensure the loop condition is met.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 2 and less than or equal to 10, `dp[n, k]` is a value in the range of 90 to slightly less than 9 billion, `i` is 2**
