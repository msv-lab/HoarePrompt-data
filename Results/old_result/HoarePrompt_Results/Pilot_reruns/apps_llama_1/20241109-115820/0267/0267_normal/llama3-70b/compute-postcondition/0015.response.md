The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by taking the modulus of its current value with `MOD`. The value of `MOD` is not specified, but it is commonly used in competitive programming to prevent integer overflow, and its value is usually a large prime number.

Since `dp[n, k]` is a value in the range of 9 to slightly less than 9 billion, taking the modulus with `MOD` will reduce its value to a range of 0 to `MOD - 1`.

The values of `n` and `k` are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= 10, `dp[n, k]` is a value in the range of 0 to `MOD - 1`**
