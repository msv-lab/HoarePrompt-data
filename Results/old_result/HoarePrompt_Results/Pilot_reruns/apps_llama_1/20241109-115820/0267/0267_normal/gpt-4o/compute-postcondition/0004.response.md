To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop statement is: `for num in range(l, r + 1):`

This loop will iterate over the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) and assign each value to the variable `num`.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `l` is less than or equal to `r`
* `r` is greater than or equal to `l`
* `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10
* If `func_1(num, k)` is true, `total_sum` is (`total_sum` + `l`) % MOD and `num` is `l`
* If `func_1(num, k)` is false, `total_sum` remains 0 and `num` is `l`

To execute the loop one more time, the value of `num` should be the next value in the range. Since `num` is currently `l`, the next value would be `l + 1`.

However, we also need to consider the conditions that would allow the loop to execute again. The loop will execute as long as `num` is less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `l` is less than `r`, and `num` is the next value in the range.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`l` is less than `r`, `r` is greater than `l`, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, `total_sum` is (`total_sum` + `l`) % MOD if `func_1(num, k)` is true, otherwise remains 0, `num` is `l + 1`**
