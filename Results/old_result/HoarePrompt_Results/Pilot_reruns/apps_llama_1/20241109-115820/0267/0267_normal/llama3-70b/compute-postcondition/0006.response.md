To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that make the loop valid. The loop iterates over the range from 1 to `k` (exclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 1.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a non-negative integer
- `k` is a positive integer such that `k` <= 10
- `dp[n, k]` is 9

We need to adjust the state to ensure the loop can execute. Since `k` needs to be greater than 1 for the loop to run, we'll adjust `k`'s state accordingly. The state of `n` and `dp[n, k]` does not directly affect the loop's ability to execute, so we don't need to adjust those. However, since `i` is the loop variable, we should include its initial state, which would be 1 (the first value in the range).

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1 and less than or equal to 10, `dp[n, k]` is 9, `i` is 1**
