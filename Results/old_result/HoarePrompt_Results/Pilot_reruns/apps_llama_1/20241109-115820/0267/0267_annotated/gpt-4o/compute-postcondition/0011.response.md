Based on the loop code and the output states after the first few iterations, I will determine the loop's output state.

The loop iterates over the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) and checks if `func_1(num, k)` returns True for each number `num` in the range. If it does, the loop adds `num` to `total_sum` and takes the modulus of the sum with `MOD`.

Output State: **The loop calculates the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)` and stores it in `total_sum`. The sum is taken modulo `MOD`. If no numbers in the range satisfy the condition, `total_sum` remains 0. The loop will execute at least once if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop will not execute and `total_sum` will remain 0.**

Note that I've included the case where the loop doesn't execute if `l` is greater than `r`, which is an edge case that needs to be considered.
