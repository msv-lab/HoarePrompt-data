The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulus with `MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0 and `num` is `l`. The value of `MOD` is not specified, but it is typically a large prime number.

Assuming `MOD` is a constant, the new value of `total_sum` is `(0 + l) % MOD`, which simplifies to `l % MOD`.

The output state is: `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l`.

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `total_sum` is `l % MOD`, `num` is `l`.**
