The function returns `total_sum`, which is the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)`, taken modulo `MOD`. The initial state already describes the possible values of `total_sum`, so the output state is the same as the initial state with the addition of the return statement.

Output State: **The loop calculates the sum of all numbers in the range [l, r] that satisfy the condition `func_1(num, k)` and stores it in `total_sum`. The sum is taken modulo `MOD`. If no numbers in the range satisfy the condition, `total_sum` remains 0. The loop will execute at least once if `l` is less than or equal to `r`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop will not execute and `total_sum` will remain 0, and the function returns `total_sum`.**
