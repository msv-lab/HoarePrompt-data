Let's analyze the code step by step.

The code `res += char` appends the value of `char` to the end of the string `res`. 

In the initial state, if 'a' is in `s`, then `res` is the string of all 'a's from `s`, and if 'a' is not in `s`, then `res` is an empty string. The value of `char` is 'b'.

If 'a' is in `s`, then `res` will be appended with 'b', so `res` will be the string of all 'a's from `s` followed by 'b'. If 'a' is not in `s`, then `res` will be appended with 'b', so `res` will be 'b'.

The states of the other variables (`s`, `alphabet`) are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: if 'a' is in `s` then `res` is the string of all 'a's from `s` followed by 'b', `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `char` is 'b'. if 'a' is not in `s` then `res` is 'b', `s` is the input string unchanged, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `char` is 'b'.

Output State: **if 'a' is in `s` then `res` is the string of all 'a's from `s` followed by 'b', `s` is the input string with all 'a's replaced by 'b's, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `char` is 'b'. if 'a' is not in `s` then `res` is 'b', `s` is the input string unchanged, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `char` is 'b'.**
