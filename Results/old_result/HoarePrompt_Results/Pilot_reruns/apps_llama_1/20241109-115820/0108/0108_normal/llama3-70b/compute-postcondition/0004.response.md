The code `res += char` appends the value of `char` to the end of `res`. The initial value of `res` is an empty string, and the value of `char` is 'a'. 

Therefore, after execution, `res` becomes 'a'. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`s` is an input string, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
