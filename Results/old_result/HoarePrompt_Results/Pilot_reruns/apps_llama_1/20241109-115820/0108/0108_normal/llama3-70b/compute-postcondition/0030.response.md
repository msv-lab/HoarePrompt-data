The given code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. 

Since `s` already contains `char` at least once, this replacement will definitely occur. 

`char` is the second character not found in `s` after the loop execution, so it will be replaced by the next character in the alphabet, which is the third character not found in `s`.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `res` accumulates characters from 'a' up to and including the second character not found in `s` and `char`, `s` has its characters shifted one position forward in the alphabet and contains the third character not found in `s` at least once, `alphabet` remains unchanged, and `char` is the second character not found in `s` after the loop execution.

Output State: **`res` accumulates characters from 'a' up to and including the second character not found in `s` and `char`, `s` has its characters shifted one position forward in the alphabet and contains the third character not found in `s` at least once, `alphabet` remains unchanged, and `char` is the second character not found in `s` after the loop execution.**
