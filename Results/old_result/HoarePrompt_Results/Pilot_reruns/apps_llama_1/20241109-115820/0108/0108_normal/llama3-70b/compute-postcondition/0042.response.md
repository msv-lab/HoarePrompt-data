Let's break down the code and annotations step by step.

The function `func` takes no parameters and returns no value (it prints output instead).

Here's what the code does:

1. It takes an input string `s` from the user.
2. It defines a string `alphabet` containing all lowercase English letters.
3. It initializes an empty string `res`.
4. It iterates through each character `char` in `alphabet`. For each `char`, it repeatedly removes the first occurrence of `char` from `s` and appends it to `res`, until `char` is no longer found in `s`.
5. After the loop, if `res` contains all 26 characters from `alphabet` (i.e., `len(res) == 26`), it prints `res`. Otherwise, it prints -1.

Now, let's consider potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If the input string `s` is empty, the function will print -1.
* If the input string `s` contains non-alphabetical characters, they will be ignored by the function.
* If the input string `s` contains uppercase letters, they will be ignored by the function.
* If the input string `s` contains duplicate characters, they will be removed and appended to `res` in alphabetical order.

The annotations suggest that the function should print `res` if it contains all 26 characters from `alphabet`, but they don't mention what happens if `res` is empty or contains non-alphabetical characters. The code, however, handles these cases by printing -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function takes an input string `s` and prints the characters from `s` in alphabetical order if all 26 lowercase English letters are present in `s`. Otherwise, it prints -1. If `s` is empty or contains non-alphabetical characters, it prints -1. **
