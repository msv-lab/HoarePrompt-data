To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is `res += char`. This means that the value of `char` is appended to the end of `res`.

From the initial state, we know that `res` accumulates characters from 'a' up to and including the second character not found in `s`, and `char` is the second character not found in `s` after the loop execution.

So, after executing the code snippet, `res` will accumulate one more character, which is `char`.

The other variables, `s`, `alphabet`, and `char`, remain unchanged.

Therefore, the output state is: `res` accumulates characters from 'a' up to and including the second character not found in `s` and `char`, `s` has its characters shifted one position forward in the alphabet and contains `char` at least once, `alphabet` remains unchanged, and `char` is the second character not found in `s` after the loop execution.

Output State: **`res` accumulates characters from 'a' up to and including the second character not found in `s` and `char`, `s` has its characters shifted one position forward in the alphabet and contains `char` at least once, `alphabet` remains unchanged, and `char` is the second character not found in `s` after the loop execution.**
