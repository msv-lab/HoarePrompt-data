An empty set named `seen_remainders` is created. The values of `n` and `k` are not affected, so the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n and 1 <= k <= 10^18, if k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'; otherwise, the function does not return 'No', `seen_remainders` is an empty set.
