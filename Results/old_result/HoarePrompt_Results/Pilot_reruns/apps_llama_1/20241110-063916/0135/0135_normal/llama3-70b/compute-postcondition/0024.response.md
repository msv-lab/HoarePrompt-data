The function `func` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` as input from the user. 

According to the code, it checks if the remainders of `n` divided by all numbers from 1 to `k` are unique. If a duplicate remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits. If all remainders are unique, it prints 'Yes'.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic:

- The function does not handle cases where `n` or `k` is not an integer, or if `k` is less than 1. In such cases, the function's behavior is undefined.
- The function does not handle cases where the user input is not in the correct format (i.e., two integers separated by a space). In such cases, the function will raise an exception.
- The function does not handle cases where `k` is 0 or negative. In such cases, the loop will not execute, and the function will print 'Yes' without checking any remainders.

Considering these potential edge cases and missing logic, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k` as input from the user, checks if the remainders of `n` divided by all numbers from 1 to `k` are unique, and prints 'Yes' if all remainders are unique or 'No' if a duplicate remainder is found, but may raise exceptions or produce undefined behavior for invalid or out-of-range inputs. **
