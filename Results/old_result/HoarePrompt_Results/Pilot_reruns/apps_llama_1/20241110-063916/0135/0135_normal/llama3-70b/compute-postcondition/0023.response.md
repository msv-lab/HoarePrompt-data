The function `func` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers, where `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^18, and `k` is also greater than or equal to 1 and less than or equal to 10^18.

However, since there is no provided output for this function, I will assume that the output is not specified.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and k, both integers within the range 1 to 10^18.**
