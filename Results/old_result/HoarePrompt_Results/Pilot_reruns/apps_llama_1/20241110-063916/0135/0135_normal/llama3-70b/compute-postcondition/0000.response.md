The code `n, k = map(int, input().split())` takes an input string, splits it into two parts, converts each part to an integer using the `int` function, and assigns the results to `n` and `k`, respectively.

Given the initial state that `n` and `k` are integers, the code overwrites these values with the new input values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
