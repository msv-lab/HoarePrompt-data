To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition and the given states.

The loop condition is `range(1, k + 1)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, we have:
- `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n (no change needed)
- `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18 (no change needed)
- `seen_remainders` is a set (no change needed)
- `i` is an integer incremented by 1 (needs to be incremented by 1)
- `remainder` is an integer between 0 and `i-1`, inclusive (needs to be updated based on the new value of `i`)

Since `i` is incremented by 1, the new value of `i` should be within the range of the loop. Therefore, `k` should be greater than the current value of `i`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k > i, `seen_remainders` is a set, `i` is an integer incremented by 1, and `remainder` is an integer between 0 and `i`, inclusive**
