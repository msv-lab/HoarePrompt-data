Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and initially `remainder` is 0 and `seen` is an empty set. If `remainder` is in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and terminates. Otherwise, the program continues execution without printing 'No' or terminating, with `remainder` not being in `seen`.***
