To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that affect its execution. The loop iterates from 1 to `k` (inclusive), so for it to execute at least once, `k` must be greater than 0.

State before the loop starts: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set

Since `k` is already given to be at least 1, the condition for the loop to execute is inherently satisfied. However, we need to explicitly state the value of `i` for the loop to start execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
