To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet:

`remainder = n % i`

Given that `n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, and `i` is 1, we can calculate the remainder as follows:

`remainder = n % 1`

Since any integer `n` divided by 1 leaves a remainder of 0, the value of `remainder` will always be 0.

The states of the other variables are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is:

`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= k <= 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0**
