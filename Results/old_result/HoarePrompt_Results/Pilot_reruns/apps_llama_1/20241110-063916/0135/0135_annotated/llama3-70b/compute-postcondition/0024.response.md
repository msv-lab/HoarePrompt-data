Based on the provided annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the functionality of the function.

The function `func` is supposed to accept two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers. However, the provided code snippet does not show the function accepting any parameters. Assuming the correct function signature is `def func(n, k):`, I'll proceed with describing the functionality.

The function calculates the remainders of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k` and checks if these remainders are unique. If a duplicate remainder is found, the program prints 'No' and terminates. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, the program prints 'Yes'.

However, there are some potential edge cases and missing logic:

* If `k` is 0 or lower, the loop doesn't execute, and the program prints 'Yes' without checking any remainders.
* If `n` is 0, the program will print 'No' as soon as it tries to calculate the remainder, because 0 divided by any number is 0, which is a duplicate remainder.
* If `n` is a negative number, the program will still calculate the remainders, but the result might not be what the user expects.

Considering these potential edge cases and missing logic, the functionality of the function can be described as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, calculates the remainders of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k`, and checks if these remainders are unique. If a duplicate remainder is found, it prints 'No' and terminates. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, it prints 'Yes'. However, if `k` is 0 or lower, it prints 'Yes' without checking any remainders, and if `n` is 0, it prints 'No' immediately. The function also works with negative numbers, but the result might not be what the user expects. **
