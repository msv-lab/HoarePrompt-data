To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the loop statement:

```
for i in range(1, k + 1):
    # the loop body is omit
```

The loop will execute if the range `1` to `k + 1` is not empty. This means `k` must be at least `1` for the loop to run at least once. The variable `i` will take values from `1` to `k` (inclusive) in each iteration.

Given the initial state: `n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer, `seen` is an empty set.

For the loop to execute, we need to adjust the state to ensure `k` is at least `1`, and `i` should be initialized to the first value in the range, which is `1`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
