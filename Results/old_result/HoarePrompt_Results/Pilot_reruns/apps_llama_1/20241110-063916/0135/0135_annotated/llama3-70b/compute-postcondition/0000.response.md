The code snippet uses the `map` function to apply the `int` function to the input values, and the `split` method to split the input into two values. The values are then assigned to `n` and `k`.

Since `n` and `k` are initially integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10^18, and the code snippet assigns new values to `n` and `k` from the input, the output state will be the new values of `n` and `k` which are also integers.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
