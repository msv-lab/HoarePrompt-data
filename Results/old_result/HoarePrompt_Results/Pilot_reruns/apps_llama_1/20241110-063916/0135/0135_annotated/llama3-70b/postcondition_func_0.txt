The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, calculates the remainders of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k`, and checks if these remainders are unique. If a duplicate remainder is found, it prints 'No' and terminates. If the loop completes without finding any duplicate remainders, it prints 'Yes'. However, if `k` is 0 or lower, it prints 'Yes' without checking any remainders, and if `n` is 0, it prints 'No' immediately. The function also works with negative numbers, but the result might not be what the user expects.
