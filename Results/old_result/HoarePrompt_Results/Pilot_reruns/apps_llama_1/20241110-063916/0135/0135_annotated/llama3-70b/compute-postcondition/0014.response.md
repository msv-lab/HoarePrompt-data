To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop condition.

The loop statement is `for i in range(1, k + 1):`. This means the loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `k`. Since `i` is 2, `k` must be at least 3 for the loop to continue.

The other states, `n`, `remainder`, and `seen`, do not affect the loop condition, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `remainder` is 1, and `seen` is a set containing 0 and 1**
