The value of `remainder` is reassigned to the result of `n % i`, where `n` is an input integer and `i` is 2. This operation calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 2. The value of `remainder` can be either 0 or 1, depending on whether `n` is even or odd.

The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and `seen` is a set containing 0**
