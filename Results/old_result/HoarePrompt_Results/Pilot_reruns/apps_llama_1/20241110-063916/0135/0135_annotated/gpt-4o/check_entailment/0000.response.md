Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements the problem description. It checks if all the remainders of `n` divided by numbers from 1 to `k` are distinct. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it immediately returns 'No', which is correct because the remainder of `n` divided by `n` is 0, which is the same as the remainder of `n` divided by 1.

The annotations were helpful in understanding the code, especially in identifying the edge cases. For example, the annotation "If `k` is 0, the loop does not execute and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set" helped me realize that the code correctly handles the case where `k` is 0.

The code also correctly handles the case where `n` is 0, which is not explicitly mentioned in the problem description. However, the annotation "raises a `ZeroDivisionError` if `n` is `0`" suggests that this case is not intended to be handled by the code, which is consistent with the problem description.

The examples provided in the problem description also match the expected output of the code. For example, the input `4 4` returns 'No' because the remainders of 4 divided by 1 and 4 are the same, and the input `5 3` returns 'Yes' because the remainders of 5 divided by 1, 2, and 3 are distinct.

Overall, I believe that the code correctly implements the problem description and handles all potential cases correctly.
