Let's think step by step:

The code `seen.add(remainder)` adds the value of `remainder` to the set `seen`. The initial state of `seen` is a set containing 0 and 1, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1.

If `remainder` is 0, it is already in the set `seen`, so the set remains unchanged. If `remainder` is 1, it is also already in the set `seen`, so the set remains unchanged.

However, the problem statement mentions that if `remainder` is in the set `seen`, the program prints 'No' to the console and terminates immediately. Since `remainder` is either 0 or 1, and both values are already in the set `seen`, the program will always print 'No' to the console and terminate immediately.

Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, `seen` is a set containing 0 and 1, and the program prints 'No' to the console and terminates immediately.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is at least 3, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1, `seen` is a set containing 0 and 1, and the program prints 'No' to the console and terminates immediately.**
