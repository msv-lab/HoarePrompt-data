The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. `n` is a positive integer less than or equal to 23, and `a` is a list of distinct positive integers of length `n`, where each integer is less than or equal to 10^9. After executing the function body, the function returns the number of distinct sums `m` that can be formed using the integers in `a`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer n and a list a of distinct positive integers, and returns the number of distinct sums that can be formed using the integers in a.**
