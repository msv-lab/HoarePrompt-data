Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `a` remains unchanged, `i` is increased by 1, `assigned` set is not empty and includes `a[i]` and at least one more element, `m` is uncertain, `x` is a different element in the `assigned` set. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the `assigned` set, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, the state of `can_form` remains uncertain.***
