Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `i` is 2, and if `a[i]` is twice `a[i - 1]`, then `m` remains 1 or 2, otherwise `m` is increased to 3. If `a[i]` is not twice `a[i - 1]` initially and `m` was 2, then `m` remains 3, otherwise `m` is increased from 1 to 2 and then to 3.***
