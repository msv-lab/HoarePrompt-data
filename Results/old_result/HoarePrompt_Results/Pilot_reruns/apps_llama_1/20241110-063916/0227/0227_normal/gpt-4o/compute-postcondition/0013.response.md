Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2 and less than or equal to 23, `a` is a sorted list of distinct positive integers of length `n`, where each integer is less than or equal to 10^9, `assigned` is a set containing at least two elements, the smallest integer from list `a` and one more integer, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is equal to the next integer in the `assigned` set. If the difference between the current element in list `a` and `x` is in the `assigned` set, then `can_form` is True and the loop or if statement is terminated. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged. The program maintains the initial state of `n`, `a`, `assigned`, `m`, `i`, and `x` in all cases.***
