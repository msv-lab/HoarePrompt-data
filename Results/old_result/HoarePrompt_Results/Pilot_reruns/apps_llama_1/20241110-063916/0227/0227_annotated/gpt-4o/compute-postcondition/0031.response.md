The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` includes `a[i]` and has at least two elements, `i` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is the second element in the `assigned` list, and `can_form` is True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
