Postcondition: ***`m` is increased by 1, `assigned` includes `a[i]` and has at least one element, `i` is at least 2, `n` is greater than 1, `x` is the first element in the `assigned` list, and either `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement, or `can_form` remains False otherwise.***
