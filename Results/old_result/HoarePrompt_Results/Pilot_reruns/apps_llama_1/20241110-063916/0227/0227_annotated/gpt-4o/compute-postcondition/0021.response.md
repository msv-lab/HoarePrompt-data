Postcondition: ***`m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, regardless of whether `assigned` is empty or `i` is within the valid range for `a`. If `can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged. This update occurs after checking if the difference between `a[i]` and any element in `assigned` is also in `assigned`, which only happens if `assigned` is not empty and `i` is within the valid range for `a`.***
