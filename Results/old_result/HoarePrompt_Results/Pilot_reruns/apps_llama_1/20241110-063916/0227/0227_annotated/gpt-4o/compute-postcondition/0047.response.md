Postcondition: ***`can_form` is initially False, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` has at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in the `assigned` list, `i` is at least 3, `n` is greater than 2. If `a[i] - x` is in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True and the innermost loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, the state of the program remains unchanged.***
