The value of `n` is reassigned to the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous value of `n` is a positive integer, but it is overwritten by the new input value. The state of the list `a` is not affected.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers of length unknown**
