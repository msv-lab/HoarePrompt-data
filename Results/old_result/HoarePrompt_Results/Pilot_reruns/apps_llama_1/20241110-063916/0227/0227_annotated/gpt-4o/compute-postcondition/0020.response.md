The value of `m` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `m` is unknown, so the output state is: variable `m` is increased by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`assigned` is not empty and `i` is within the valid range for `a`, `m` is increased by 1, `can_form` is either True or False**
