To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop iterates over `prefix_balances`, and at the end of the previous iteration, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more element in `prefix_balances` after `b`. 

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `prefix_balances` having at least one more element after `b`, and `b` should be the next element in `prefix_balances`. 

State: **`T`, `x`, `data`, `index`, `results`, `_`, `i`, `n`, `s` remain unchanged, `prefix_balances` has at least one more element after `b`, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`, `balance` is unchanged, `count` is either increased by 1 or remains unchanged**
