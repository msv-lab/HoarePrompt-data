To calculate the output state, we need to analyze the given code snippet and its impact on the program.

The code snippet is:
```python
print((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)
```
Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The expression `(x - balance)` is evaluated first. Since `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, this expression becomes `(x - (cnt0 - cnt1))`.
2. The expression `(cnt0 - cnt1)` is used as the divisor in the integer division `//`. 
3. The result of the integer division is added to 1.
4. The final result is printed.

Since the initial state does not provide specific values for `x`, `cnt0`, and `cnt1`, we cannot calculate a specific numerical value for the expression. However, we can express the output in terms of the variables.

The output state is: `T` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `_` is 1, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed.

Note that the `print` statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state only reflects the printing of the expression.

Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a new input string, `_` is 1, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, and the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed.**
