To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given for loop statement and the state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop statement is `for i in range(1, n + 1):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `n`. Since `i` is 3, `n` must be at least 4 to ensure the loop executes again.

The other states do not directly affect the loop's execution, so they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `n` is at least 4, `x` is the integer value of the substring at index 2 in the `data` list, `s` is the substring at index 3 in the `data` list, `data` is a list of substrings read from the input with at least one substring, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `_` is any value, `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 1` values where `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1, `prefix_balances[2]` is either 2, 0, or -2, and `prefix_balances[3]` is either 3, 1, -1, or -3, and `i` is 4**
