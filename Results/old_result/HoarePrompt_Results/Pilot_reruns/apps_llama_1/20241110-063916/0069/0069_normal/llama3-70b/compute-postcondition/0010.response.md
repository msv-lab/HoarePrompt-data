Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string input, `_` is 0, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is an integer. If `balance` equals `x`, the value of `n + 1` is printed. If `balance` does not equal `x` and `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, if `(cnt0 - cnt1)` is not zero, the function prints the integer division of `(x - balance)` by `(cnt0 - cnt1)` plus 1. If `(cnt0 - cnt1)` is zero, the function will raise a ZeroDivisionError. Note that if the result of the division is not an integer, it will be truncated due to the use of integer division (`//`).***
