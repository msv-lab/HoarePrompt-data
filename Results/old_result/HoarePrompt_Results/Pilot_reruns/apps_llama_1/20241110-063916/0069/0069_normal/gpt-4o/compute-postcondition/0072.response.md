`s` is reassigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, but the previous value of `index` is increased by 3 and the initial value of `s` was also `data[index + 2]`, so the value of `s` does not change. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than `_` by at least 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `data` remains unchanged and has at least 4 elements, `index` is increased by 3, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, `i` is `n`, `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`, and `n` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`.

Output State: **`T` is greater than `_` by at least 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `data` remains unchanged and has at least 4 elements, `index` is increased by 3, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, `i` is `n`, `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`, and `n` is the integer value of `data[index + 3]`.**
