To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is `index += 3`. This means the value of `index` will be incremented by 3.

From the initial state, we know that `index` remains unchanged before the execution of the code snippet. However, after the execution, `index` will be incremented by 3.

The other variables (`T`, `x`, `data`, `n`, `s`, `prefix_balances`, `i`, `balance`, and `results`) are not affected by the code snippet.

Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than `_` by at least 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is increased by 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `balance` remains unchanged, and the `results` list remains updated.

Output State: **`T` is greater than `_` by at least 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `data` remains unchanged, `index` is increased by 3, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` is the value of `data[index + 2]`, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `balance` remains unchanged, and the `results` list remains updated**
