The code `x = int(data[index + 1])` assigns the integer value of `data[index + 1]` to `x`. The previous value of `x` is unchanged, but its new value is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`T` is greater than `_` by at least 1, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `data` remains unchanged, `index` remains unchanged, `n` is the integer value of `data[index]`, `s` remains unchanged, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `balance` remains unchanged, and the `results` list is updated.**
