Postcondition: ***T is at least 2, n is an integer, x is an integer, s is a string, cnt0 is the count of '0' in string s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in string s, and balance is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in the string s. If (x - balance) is divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints the integer result of (x - balance) divided by (cnt0 - cnt1) plus 1. In all cases, the values of T, n, x, s, cnt0, cnt1, and balance remain unchanged. Additionally, if cnt0 equals cnt1, the program will always print -1 because (x - balance) will always be divisible by (cnt0 - cnt1), which is zero. If (cnt0 - cnt1) is zero but (x - balance) is not zero, the program will still print -1 due to the integer division by zero being undefined, but in this case, the condition (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0 will evaluate to True because the remainder of any number divided by zero is undefined but in this context it is considered as zero, hence -1 is printed.***
