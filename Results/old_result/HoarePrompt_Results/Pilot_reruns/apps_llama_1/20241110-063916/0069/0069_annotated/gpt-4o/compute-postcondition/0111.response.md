Based on the provided information, here is the description of the functionality of the function `func_1`:


The function `func_1` accepts parameters T, n, x, and s. T is a positive integer, n is a positive integer, x is an integer, and s is a string consisting of '0's and '1's of length n. However, since the output description is missing, I will assume that the output is not provided. Therefore, I will describe the functionality based on the input parameters only.
