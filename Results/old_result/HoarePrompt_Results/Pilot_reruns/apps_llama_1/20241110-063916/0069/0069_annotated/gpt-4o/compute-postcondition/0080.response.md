To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n + 1`. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2 and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented and `n` must be greater than 2.

So, the states that need to be adjusted are `i` and `n`. `i` should be incremented to 3, and `n` should be greater than 2.

State: **`T` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `input` remains unchanged, `index` remains unchanged, `x` remains unchanged, `balance` remains unchanged, `i` is 3, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer value greater than 2, `prefix_balances` is a list where the first three elements are [0, 1, 2], [0, 1, 0], [0, -1, 0], or [0, -1, -2], `results` remains unchanged, `s` is `data[index + 2]`**
