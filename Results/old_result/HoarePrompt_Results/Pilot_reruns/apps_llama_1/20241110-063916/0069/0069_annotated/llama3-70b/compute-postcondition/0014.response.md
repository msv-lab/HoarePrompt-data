`cnt0` is assigned the count of '0' in the string `s`, and `cnt1` is assigned the count of '1' in the string `s`. The previous values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are the counts of '0' and '1' in the previous string, respectively, but they are overwritten by the new counts from string `s`. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`T` is at least 2, `n` is a new input integer, `x` is a new input integer, `s` is a new input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, and `balance` is the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in the previous string**
