`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`. The values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `input` remains unchanged, `index` remains unchanged, `x` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `balance` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index])`, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `results` remains unchanged, `s` is `data[index + 2]`.

Output State: **`T` remains unchanged, `data` remains unchanged, `input` remains unchanged, `index` remains unchanged, `x` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index + 1])`, `balance` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` is an integer value equal to `int(data[index])`, `prefix_balances` remains unchanged, `results` remains unchanged, `s` is `data[index + 2]`.**
