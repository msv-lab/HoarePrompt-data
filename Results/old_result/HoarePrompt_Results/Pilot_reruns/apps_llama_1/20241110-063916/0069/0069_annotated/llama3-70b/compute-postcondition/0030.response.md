Postcondition: ***`T` is at least 3, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is the new input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, `n + 1` is printed. If `balance` does not equal `x` but `(x - balance)` is a multiple of `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed, handling cases where `(x - balance)` is not a multiple of `(cnt0 - cnt1)` and covering all edge cases.***
