Correctness: **False**

The program does not work correctly for all cases. 

For example, when the input is:
```
1
5 0
10101
```
The program will output:
```
0
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
-1
```
This is because the string "10101" repeated infinitely will have an infinite number of prefixes with balance 0.

The issue with the program is that it does not correctly handle the case when the balance of the string is 0 and the desired balance is also 0. In this case, the program should output -1, but it outputs 0 instead.

Also, the program does not correctly handle the case when the desired balance is not achievable by repeating the string. For example, when the input is:
```
1
3 4
101
```
The program will output:
```
3
```
However, the correct output should be:
```
0
```
This is because the string "101" repeated infinitely will never have a prefix with balance 4.
