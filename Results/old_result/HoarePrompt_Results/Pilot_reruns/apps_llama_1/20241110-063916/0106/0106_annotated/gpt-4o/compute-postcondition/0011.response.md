The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, while `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a!= b.

After executing the function body, the function returns an integer `total_time`, which is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept five parameters n, m, k, a, and b, and return the total time based on the values of these parameters.
