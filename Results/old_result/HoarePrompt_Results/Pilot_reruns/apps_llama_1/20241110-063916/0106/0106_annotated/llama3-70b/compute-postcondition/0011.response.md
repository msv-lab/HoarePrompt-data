The function `func` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers, and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= `a`, `b` <= `n`*`m`*`k`, and `a`!= `b`. However, the output of the function is not provided, so we cannot determine the return value of the function.


Please provide the output of the function so I can complete the description of its functionality.
