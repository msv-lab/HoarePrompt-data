The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` assigns new values to `a` and `b` by taking two input integers, converting them to integers using `map(int,...)`, and splitting them into two separate values using `input().split()`.

The initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k, and a!= b. However, the code overwrites these values with new input integers.

Since the new values of `a` and `b` are input integers, we can conclude that:

* `a` is an input integer
* `b` is an input integer
* `n`, `m`, and `k` are still input integers (their values are not changed by the code)

The output state is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer**
