The function returns `total_time`, which is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. The values of `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b`, `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b`, `time_to_exit`, `direct_walk_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` do not change. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is the same as the initial state, with the addition that the function returns `total_time`.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers, `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a!= b, `block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned values based on the location of `a`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned values based on the location of `b`, `time_to_exit` is either 0 or an integer equal to 10 plus the difference between `floor_a` and 1, `direct_walk_time` is an integer equal to the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15, `reverse_walk_time` is an integer equal to (n - absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`) modulo `n` multiplied by 15, `min_walk_time` is the minimum of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, `time_to_target_floor` is an integer multiple of 5, `total_time` is an integer equal to the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, and the function returns `total_time**
