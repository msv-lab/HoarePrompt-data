Based on the provided code and problem description, my initial assessment is that the program seems to be correct. It appears to calculate the total time required for Edward to move from his apartment to Natasha's apartment, considering the time to exit the starting floor, the minimum walking time, and the time to reach the target floor.

The code defines two functions: `func_1` and `get_location`. The `get_location` function calculates the block and floor numbers for a given apartment number, and the `func_1` function uses these values to calculate the total time required for the move.

The output hints seem to agree with the code, and they provide a clear explanation of how the functions work. The hints do not mention any cases that are not handled by the code.

However, after re-examining the code, I found a potential issue. In the `get_location` function, the calculation for the `block` value uses the formula `(apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. This formula assumes that the apartment numbers start from 1, but it does not check if the apartment number is valid (i.e., if it is within the range of 1 to `n * m * k`). If the apartment number is outside this range, the function may return incorrect values for `block` and `floor`.

Therefore, I conclude that the program is not correct for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where the apartment number is outside the valid range. For example, if the input apartment numbers are `a = 0` and `b = 1`, the program will return incorrect results.
