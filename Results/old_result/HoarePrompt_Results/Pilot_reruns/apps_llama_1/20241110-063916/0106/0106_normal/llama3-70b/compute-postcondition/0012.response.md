The function `func` does not accept any parameters, but it takes five integers as input from the user: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. 

The function calculates the time it takes to move from room `a` to room `b` in a building with `n` blocks, each block having `m` floors, and each floor having `k` rooms. The rooms are numbered from 1 to `n*m*k`.

The function first calculates the block numbers of rooms `a` and `b` by dividing their room numbers by `m*k` and rounding up to the nearest integer. It then calculates the floor numbers of rooms `a` and `b` by taking the remainder of their room numbers divided by `m` and adding 1.

The function then calculates the minimum time it takes to move between the blocks of rooms `a` and `b` by taking the minimum of the absolute difference between the block numbers and `n` minus the absolute difference between the block numbers, and multiplying the result by 15.

The function also calculates the minimum time it takes to move between the floors of rooms `a` and `b` by taking the absolute difference between the floor numbers, multiplying the result by 5, and adding 10.

Finally, the function prints the sum of the minimum block time and the minimum floor time.

Functionality: ** The function takes five integers as input from the user, calculates the time it takes to move from one room to another in a building, and prints the result. The building has a variable number of blocks, floors, and rooms, and the rooms are numbered from 1 to the total number of rooms. The function calculates the minimum time it takes to move between the blocks and floors of the two rooms and prints the sum of these times. **
