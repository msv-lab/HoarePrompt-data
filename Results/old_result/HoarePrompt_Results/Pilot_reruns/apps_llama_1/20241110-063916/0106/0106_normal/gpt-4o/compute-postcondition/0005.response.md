Based on the provided annotated code and return postconditions, I'll analyze the functionality of the `get_location` function.

The function `get_location` accepts an integer `apartment` as input and returns two values: `block` and `floor`. The calculations for `block` and `floor` are based on the formulas:

* `block = (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1`
* `floor_within_block = (apartment - 1) % (m * k)`
* `floor = floor_within_block // k + 1`

However, upon closer inspection, I notice that the variables `m` and `k` are not defined within the function or as function parameters. This suggests that `m` and `k` are assumed to be global variables or constants, but their values are not provided in the annotated code.

Given this, I'll assume that `m` and `k` are indeed global variables or constants with integer values. Under this assumption, the function calculates the `block` and `floor` values based on the provided `apartment` number.

The return postconditions state that `block` is an integer between 1 and `n`, inclusive, and `floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, inclusive. However, I notice that the value of `n` is not used in the calculations, and its relevance to the function's output is unclear.

Considering these observations, I'll provide a summary of the function's functionality:

Functionality: ** The function `get_location` accepts an integer `apartment` and returns two values: `block` and `floor`. The calculations for `block` and `floor` depend on the values of global variables or constants `m` and `k`, which are not defined within the function. The function returns `block` and `floor` values based on the provided `apartment` number, but the relationship between the input and output values is not explicitly defined without knowing the values of `m` and `k`. **
