The function `get_location` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are integers, where 1 ≤ `n`, `m`, `k` ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ `a`, `b` ≤ `n`·`m`·`k`, and `a` ≠ `b`. After executing the function body, the function returns two values: `block` and `floor`. `block` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `block` ≤ `n`, and `floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, inclusive. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` within specific ranges and return the `block` and `floor` values.

Functionality: **The function accepts integers n, m, k, a, and b within specific ranges, and returns block and floor values.**
