The value of `floor` is calculated as `floor_within_block // k + 1`. Since `floor_within_block` is an integer between 0 and `m * k - 1`, inclusive, the value of `floor_within_block // k` will be an integer between 0 and `m - 1`, inclusive. Adding 1 to this value results in `floor` being an integer between 1 and `m`, inclusive.

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are integers, 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, a ≠ b, `block` is an integer such that 1 ≤ block ≤ n, `floor_within_block` is an integer between 0 and `m * k - 1`, inclusive, and `floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, inclusive.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, `b` are integers, 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k, a ≠ b, `block` is an integer such that 1 ≤ block ≤ n, `floor_within_block` is an integer between 0 and `m * k - 1`, inclusive, and `floor` is an integer between 1 and `m`, inclusive.**
