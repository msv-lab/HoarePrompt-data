The code `a, b = map(int, input().split())` assigns new values to `a` and `b` based on the input. The previous values of `a` and `b` are integers such that 1 <= a, b <= n*m*k and a!= b, but these values are overwritten. The new values of `a` and `b` are input integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `k` are not affected.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are input integers, `a` and `b` are input integers**
