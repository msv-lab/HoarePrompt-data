You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There are n employees in Alternative Cake Manufacturing (ACM). They are now voting on some very important question and the leading world media are trying to predict the outcome of the vote.

Each of the employees belongs to one of two fractions: depublicans or remocrats, and these two fractions have opposite opinions on what should be the outcome of the vote. The voting procedure is rather complicated:   Each of n employees makes a statement. They make statements one by one starting from employees 1 and finishing with employee n. If at the moment when it's time for the i-th employee to make a statement he no longer has the right to vote, he just skips his turn (and no longer takes part in this voting).  When employee makes a statement, he can do nothing or declare that one of the other employees no longer has a right to vote. It's allowed to deny from voting people who already made the statement or people who are only waiting to do so. If someone is denied from voting he no longer participates in the voting till the very end.  When all employees are done with their statements, the procedure repeats: again, each employees starting from 1 and finishing with n who are still eligible to vote make their statements.  The process repeats until there is only one employee eligible to vote remaining and he determines the outcome of the whole voting. Of course, he votes for the decision suitable for his fraction. 

You know the order employees are going to vote and that they behave optimal (and they also know the order and who belongs to which fraction). Predict the outcome of the vote.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains a single integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200 000) — the number of employees. 

The next line contains n characters. The i-th character is 'D' if the i-th employee is from depublicans fraction or 'R' if he is from remocrats.


-----Output-----

Print 'D' if the outcome of the vote will be suitable for depublicans and 'R' if remocrats will win.


-----Examples-----
Input
5
DDRRR

Output
D

Input
6
DDRRRR

Output
R



-----Note-----

Consider one of the voting scenarios for the first sample:   Employee 1 denies employee 5 to vote.  Employee 2 denies employee 3 to vote.  Employee 3 has no right to vote and skips his turn (he was denied by employee 2).  Employee 4 denies employee 2 to vote.  Employee 5 has no right to vote and skips his turn (he was denied by employee 1).  Employee 1 denies employee 4.  Only employee 1 now has the right to vote so the voting ends with the victory of depublicans.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    #State of the program here: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.
    votes = input().strip()
    #State of the program here: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string
    d_queue = []
    #State of the program here: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string, `d_queue` is an empty list
    r_queue = []
    #State of the program here: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string, `d_queue` is an empty list, and `r_queue` is a new empty list
    for (i, v) in enumerate(votes):
        if v == 'D':
            d_queue.append(i)
        else:
            r_queue.append(i)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: The loop separates the indices of 'D' and non-'D' characters in the `votes` string into two separate lists, `d_queue` and `r_queue`, respectively. After the loop executes, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in the `votes` string, and `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters. If the `votes` string is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty lists. If the `votes` string contains at least one character, the loop executes, and the value of `i` will be the index of the last character in the `votes` string, and the value of `v` will be the last character in the `votes` string. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop.
    while d_queue and r_queue:
        d_index = d_queue.pop(0)
        
        r_index = r_queue.pop(0)
        
        if d_index < r_index:
            d_queue.append(d_index + n)
        else:
            r_queue.append(r_index + n)
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, the loop will execute until one of them becomes empty. After the loop finishes, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will be empty, and the other will have elements that are the sum of the initial elements and `n`. If `d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` will have all the remaining elements, and if `r_queue` is empty, `d_queue` will have all the remaining elements. If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are initially empty, the loop will not execute, and both will remain empty. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop. The variables `i` and `v` are not modified by the loop and will retain their initial values.
    if d_queue :
        print('D')
        #State of the program here: If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, the loop will execute until one of them becomes empty. After the loop finishes, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will be empty, and the other will have elements that are the sum of the initial elements and `n`. If `d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` will have all the remaining elements, and if `r_queue` is empty, `d_queue` will have all the remaining elements. If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are initially empty, the loop will not execute, and both will remain empty. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop. The variables `i` and `v` are not modified by the loop and will retain their initial values. Also, 'D' is printed.
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, the loop will execute until one of them becomes empty. After the loop finishes, either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will be empty, and the other will have elements that are the sum of the initial elements and `n`. If `d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` will have all the remaining elements, and if `r_queue` is empty, `d_queue` will have all the remaining elements. If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are initially empty, the loop will not execute, and both will remain empty. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop. The variables `i` and `v` are not modified by the loop and will retain their initial values. Also, 'D' is printed.
    else :
        print('R')
        #State of the program here: 'R' is printed, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` have the same state as before the print statement, `n` remains unchanged, `i` and `v` retain their initial values
    #State of the program after the else part has been executed: 'R' is printed, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` have the same state as before the print statement, `n` remains unchanged, `i` and `v` retain their initial values
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`d_queue` and `r_queue` are either empty or have elements that are the sum of the initial elements and `n`. If `d_queue` is not empty, 'D' is printed. Otherwise, 'R' is printed. The value of `n` remains unchanged throughout the execution of the loop. The variables `i` and `v` are not modified by the loop and will retain their initial values. If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are initially empty, the loop will not execute, and both will remain empty. If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty, the loop will execute until one of them becomes empty. Either `d_queue` or `r_queue` will be empty, and the other will have elements that are the sum of the initial elements and `n`. If `d_queue` is empty, `r_queue` will have all the remaining elements, and if `r_queue` is empty, `d_queue` will have all the remaining elements.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts two inputs from the user: a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It then simulates a process where 'D' and non-'D' characters compete, and finally prints 'D' if the 'D' characters win or 'R' otherwise. The function handles edge cases where `votes` is empty or contains only 'D' or non-'D' characters, and also handles the case where `n` is 0.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
