Postcondition: ***`d_queue` has at least one less element, `r_queue` has one less element, `d_index` remains the same as before, `r_index` is the value of the removed first element from `r_queue`, `i` remains the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` remains the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` has one more element which is `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` has the same number of elements as before and the last element is `r_index + n`.***
