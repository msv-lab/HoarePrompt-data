The code snippet `votes = input().strip()` reassigns the value of `votes` to a new input string, stripped of leading and trailing whitespace. The initial value of `votes` is a string of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', but it is overwritten by the new input.

The value of `n` is not affected by this code snippet, as it is not reassigned or modified.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a new input string**
