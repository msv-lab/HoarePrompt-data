Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is the number of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the number of characters in `fractions` that are not 'D', and `n` remains unchanged. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, 'D' is printed to the console. Otherwise, 'R' is printed to the console. This outcome holds regardless of whether `fractions` is an empty string or contains characters, and the values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` are accurately reflected based on the composition of `fractions`.***
