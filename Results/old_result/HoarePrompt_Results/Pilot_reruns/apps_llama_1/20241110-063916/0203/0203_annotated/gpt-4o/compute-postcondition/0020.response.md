To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given Python code snippet and the initial state.

The code snippet is:
```python
d_queue.append(d_index + n)
```
From the initial state, we know that `d_queue` has the first element removed, `d_index` is the index of the first 'D' character in the `votes` string, `n` remains unchanged.

The code appends the sum of `d_index` and `n` to `d_queue`. 

So, the output state is: `d_queue` has the sum of `d_index` and `n` appended, `d_index` is the index of the first 'D' character in the `votes` string, `r_queue` has the first element removed, `r_index` is the index of a non-'D' character, `i` is the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` is the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`d_queue` has the sum of `d_index` and `n` appended, `d_index` is the index of the first 'D' character in the `votes` string, `r_queue` has the first element removed, `r_index` is the index of a non-'D' character, `i` is the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` is the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged**
