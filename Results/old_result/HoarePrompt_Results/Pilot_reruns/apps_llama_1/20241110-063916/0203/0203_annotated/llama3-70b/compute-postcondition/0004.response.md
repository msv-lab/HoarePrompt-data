According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `fractions`. If the string is not empty, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is an input string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0. To ensure the loop can execute, the state needs to be adjusted to `fractions` is a non-empty string and `fraction` is the first character in the string.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty input string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character in the string**
