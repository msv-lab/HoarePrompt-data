The value of `d_index` is assigned the first element of `d_queue`, which is the index of the first 'D' character in the `votes` string. The first element is removed from `d_queue`. The values of `r_queue`, `i`, `v`, and `n` are not affected.

Output State: **`d_queue` has the first element removed, `d_index` is the index of the first 'D' character in the `votes` string, `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters, `i` is the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` is the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged**
