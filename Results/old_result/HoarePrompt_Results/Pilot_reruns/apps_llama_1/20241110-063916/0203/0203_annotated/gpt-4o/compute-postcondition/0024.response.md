`d_index` is assigned the value of the first element in `d_queue`, which is then removed from `d_queue`. Since `d_queue` had at least one element after the first element was removed, it now has at least one element. The states of the other variables are not affected.

Output State: **`d_queue` has at least one element, `r_queue` has at least one element after the first element was removed, `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_index` remains the index of a non-'D' character, `i` remains the index of the last character in the `votes` string, `v` remains the last character in the `votes` string, and `n` remains unchanged**
