Postcondition: ***`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_index` is the index of a 'D' character in `votes`, and `r_index` is the index of a non-'D' character in `votes`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index` and `d_index + n`, and `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `r_index`. Otherwise, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index`, and `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `r_index` and the new index `r_index + n`.***
