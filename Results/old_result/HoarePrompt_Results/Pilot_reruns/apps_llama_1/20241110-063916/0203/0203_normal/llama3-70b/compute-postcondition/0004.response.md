To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop iterates over `fractions`, which is a string. For the loop to execute, `fractions` must be a non-empty string.

Additionally, the variable `fraction` is introduced in the loop, which takes on the value of each character in the `fractions` string during each iteration.

Here's the adjusted state:

State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty input string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first character in the `fractions` string**
