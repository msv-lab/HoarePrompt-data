`r_queue` is appended with the value `r_index + n`. The value of `r_index` is the index of a non-'D' character in `votes`, and `n` remains unchanged. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index`, `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `r_index` and the new index `r_index + n`, `d_index` is the index of a 'D' character in `votes`, and `r_index` is the index of a non-'D' character in `votes`.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index`, `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `r_index` and the new index `r_index + n`, `d_index` is the index of a 'D' character in `votes`, and `r_index` is the index of a non-'D' character in `votes`.**
