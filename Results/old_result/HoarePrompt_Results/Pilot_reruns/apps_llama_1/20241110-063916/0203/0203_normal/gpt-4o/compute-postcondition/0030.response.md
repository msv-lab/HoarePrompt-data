The code `d_index = d_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `d_queue` and assigns it to `d_index`. 

Since `d_index` is not the last index in `d_queue` initially, after removing the first element, `d_index` will be updated to the removed value. The state of `n`, `i`, `v`, and `r_index` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_index` is the first element that was in `d_queue`, `r_index` is less than the length of `votes` minus `n` and is not the last index in `r_queue`.**
