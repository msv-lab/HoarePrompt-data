Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a non-empty input string, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in `votes`. If the first character `v` in `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` is a list containing 0 and `r_queue` is an empty list. Otherwise, `d_queue` is an empty list and `r_queue` is a list containing 0.***
