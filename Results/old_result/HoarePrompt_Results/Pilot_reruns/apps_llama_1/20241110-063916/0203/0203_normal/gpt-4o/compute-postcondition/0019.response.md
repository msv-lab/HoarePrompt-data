The code `r_index = r_queue.pop(0)` removes the first element from `r_queue` and assigns it to `r_index`. Since `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes`, the value of `r_index` will be the index of a non-'D' character in `votes`. The state of `n`, `i`, `v`, `d_queue`, and `d_index` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index`, `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `r_index`, `d_index` is the index of a 'D' character in `votes`, and `r_index` is the index of a non-'D' character in `votes`.**
