The code appends `d_index + n` to `d_queue`. Since `n` remains unchanged and `d_index` is the index of a 'D' character in `votes`, the value appended to `d_queue` is the index of a 'D' character in `votes` plus `n`. The other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` remains unchanged, `i` is the index of the last character in `votes`, `v` is the last character in `votes`, `d_queue` contains the indices of all 'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `d_index` and `d_index + n`, `r_queue` contains the indices of all non-'D' characters in `votes` except the one at index `r_index`, `d_index` is the index of a 'D' character in `votes`, and `r_index` is the index of a non-'D' character in `votes`.**
