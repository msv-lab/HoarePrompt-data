The code `d_queue.append(i)` adds the value of `i` to the end of the `d_queue` list. Since `i` is 0, the list `d_queue` will now contain the element 0.

The other variables are not affected by this code. The value of `n` is still an input integer, `votes` is still a non-empty input string, `r_queue` is still an empty list, `i` is still 0, and `v` is still the first character in `votes`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a non-empty input string, `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in `votes`**
