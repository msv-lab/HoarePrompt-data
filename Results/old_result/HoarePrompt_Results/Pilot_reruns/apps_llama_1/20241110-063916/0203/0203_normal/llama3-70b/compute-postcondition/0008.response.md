To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the for loop statement and the given state at the end of the previous iteration.

The for loop statement is `for fraction in fractions:`, which means the loop will iterate over each character in the `fractions` string.

Given the state at the end of the previous iteration:

* `n` is an input integer (no change needed)
* `fractions` is a non-empty input string (no change needed)
* `fraction` is the first character in the `fractions` string (needs to be updated)
* If the first character in the `fractions` string is 'D', then `depublicans` is 1 and `remocrats` is 0 (needs to be updated)
* Otherwise, `depublicans` is 0 and `remocrats` is 1 (needs to be updated)

For the loop to execute one more time, the `fraction` variable should point to the next character in the `fractions` string. Since `fraction` is currently the first character, it should be updated to the second character in the `fractions` string.

Additionally, the values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` depend on the value of `fraction`. Since `fraction` is being updated to the second character, the values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` should be updated accordingly.

However, without knowing the exact value of the second character in the `fractions` string, we cannot determine the exact values of `depublicans` and `remocrats`. Therefore, we can only update the state to reflect that `fraction` is now the second character in the `fractions` string, and the values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` are dependent on the value of `fraction`.

State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `fraction` is the second character in the `fractions` string, `depublicans` and `remocrats` are dependent on the value of `fraction`**
