Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `fraction` is the second character in the `fractions` string. If `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is increased by 1 from its previous value, and `remocrats` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `remocrats` is increased by 1, and `depublicans` remains unchanged, both still dependent on the value of `fraction`.***
