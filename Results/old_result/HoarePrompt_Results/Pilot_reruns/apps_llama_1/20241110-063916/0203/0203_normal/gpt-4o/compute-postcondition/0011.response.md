Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a non-empty input string with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character in `votes`. If the first character in `votes` is 'D' and `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` is a list containing 0 and 1, and `r_queue` is an empty list. If the first character in `votes` is 'D' and `v` is not 'D', then `d_queue` is a list containing 0 and `r_queue` is a list containing 1. If the first character in `votes` is not 'D' and `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` is a list containing 1 and `r_queue` is an empty list. If the first character in `votes` is not 'D' and `v` is not 'D', then `d_queue` is an empty list and `r_queue` is a list containing 0 and 1.***
