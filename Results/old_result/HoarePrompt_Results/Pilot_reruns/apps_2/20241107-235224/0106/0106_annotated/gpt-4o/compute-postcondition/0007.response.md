Example Answer:
`min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`, but the previous values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: No specific variables are updated or assigned values. The variables remain as described in the initial state.
Output State: **No specific variables are updated or assigned values. The variables remain as described in the initial state.**
