Example Answer:
`total_time` is calculated by adding the values of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. Since no values are given for these variables in the initial state, the output state will be: total_time is the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor.
Output State: **total_time is the sum of time_to_exit, min_walk_time, and time_to_target_floor**
