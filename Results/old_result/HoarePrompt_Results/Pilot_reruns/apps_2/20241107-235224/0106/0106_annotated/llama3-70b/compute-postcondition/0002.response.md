Example Answer:
`a_floor` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) % m + 1`. The value of `a` and `m` are input integers. Therefore, the value of `a_floor` will be calculated based on the inputs provided for `a` and `m`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are integers within the valid range, `a` and `b` are input integers, `a_floor` is calculated based on the input values of `a` and `m`**
