The function `get_location` calculates the block and floor number of a given apartment based on the input parameter `apartment`. However, the actual functionality of the function cannot be determined without knowing the specific values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The function should ideally return the block and floor number of the given apartment, but without the necessary input values, the output state cannot be determined accurately.
