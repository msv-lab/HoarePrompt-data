Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the input provided. The other variables (`n`, `m`, `k`) remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are based on user input**
