Example Answer:
`a_block` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, where `a`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers. The value of `a` is based on user input, and `a_floor` is between 1 and `m`. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are based on user input, `a_floor` is between 1 and `m`; `a_block` is calculated based on the provided formula.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are based on user input, `a_floor` is between 1 and `m`; `a_block` is calculated based on the provided formula**
