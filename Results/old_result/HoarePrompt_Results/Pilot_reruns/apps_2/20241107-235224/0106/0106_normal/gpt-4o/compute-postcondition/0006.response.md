Output State: **`block_a` and `floor_a` are assigned valid block and floor numbers based on location `a`, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned valid block and floor numbers based on location `b`. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the value of `floor_a` minus 1. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`**
