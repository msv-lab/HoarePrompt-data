Example Answer:
`a_floor` is assigned the value `(a - 1) % m + 1`, where `a` is based on user input and `m` is a positive integer. The value of `a_floor` will be between 1 and `m` based on the input value of `a`. The other variables remain unaffected.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000; `a` and `b` are based on user input, `a_floor` is between 1 and `m`**
