Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, assigns valid block and floor numbers based on the locations `a` and `b`, calculates the total time required to move from location `a` to location `b`, considering various walking and waiting times. It then returns the total time. The function computes the time to exit the building based on the floor of location `a`, calculates the shortest walking distance between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. There are no missing functionalities or edge cases mentioned in the annotations that need to be addressed in the summary.**
