Functionality: **The function `func` reads user input for positive integers `n`, `m`, and `k`, as well as integers `a` and `b`. It then calculates various values based on the inputs and prints the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly as it reads input dynamically. The functionality involves calculating `a_floor`, `a_block`, `b_floor`, `b_block`, `min_block_time`, and `min_floor_time` based on the provided formulas and conditions. Finally, it outputs the sum of the calculated times.**
