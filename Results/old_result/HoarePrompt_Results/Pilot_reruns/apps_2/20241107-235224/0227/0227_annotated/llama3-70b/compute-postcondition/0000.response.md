Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the input is specified to be a positive integer within a specific range, the value of `n` will be within that range. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 23, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9)**.
Output State: **n is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 23, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9)**
