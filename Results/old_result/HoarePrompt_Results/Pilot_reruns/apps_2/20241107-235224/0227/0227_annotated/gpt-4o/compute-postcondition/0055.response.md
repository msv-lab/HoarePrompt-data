Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `assigned` contains elements from list `a` including the newly added element `a[i+3]`, `m` is greater than the maximum value in list `a`, `can_form` is True, `i` is i+4, `assigned` has at least 3 elements. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, no changes occur.***
