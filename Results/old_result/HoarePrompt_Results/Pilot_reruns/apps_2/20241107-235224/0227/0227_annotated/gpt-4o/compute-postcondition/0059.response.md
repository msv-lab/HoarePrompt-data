Postcondition: ***If the loop executes, `can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in the `assigned` list. The loop increments `i` by 1, adds the next element from list `a` to `assigned`, and checks for `can_form`. If the loop does not execute, `can_form` remains False, and no changes occur to the variables. After the execution of the if-else block, if `can_form` was initially False, `m` is incremented by 1. In all cases, `i` is updated accordingly, and the `assigned` list is modified based on the loop execution.***
