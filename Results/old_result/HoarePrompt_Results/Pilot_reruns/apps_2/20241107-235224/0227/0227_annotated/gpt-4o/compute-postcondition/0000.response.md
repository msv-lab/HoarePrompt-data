Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The previous values of the list `a` are not provided, but since it is a list of distinct positive integers, sorting it will rearrange the elements in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order.**
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_{k} ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order.**
