Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum number of variables m required to perform the described sequence of operations. It first sorts the input sequence a in ascending order. Then, it iterates through the sorted sequence and checks if the value at index i is not equal to the value at index i-1 multiplied by 2. If this condition is met, it increments the count of variables m. Finally, it prints m if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it prints -1. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it handles all potential cases correctly.
