Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order and not empty, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a` and the value added from `a[i]`, `m` is 3, `i` is 0 or 1, `n` is greater than 1. If the difference between the first element in `a` and any element in `assigned` is found in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False. If `a[i] - x` is not found in `assigned`, the loop does not execute. After the execution of the if else block, `m` is incremented by 1 if `can_form` is False, otherwise `m` remains unchanged.***
