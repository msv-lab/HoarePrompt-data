Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order and not empty, `assigned` contains at least 3 elements, `m` is 3 or 4, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True if the difference between the first element in `a` and any element in `assigned` is found in `assigned`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is terminated. This holds true for all possible cases and edge scenarios, ensuring the integrity and accuracy of the program state after the execution of the if else block.***
