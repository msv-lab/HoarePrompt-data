According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `m` is 1 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1. 
State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1**
