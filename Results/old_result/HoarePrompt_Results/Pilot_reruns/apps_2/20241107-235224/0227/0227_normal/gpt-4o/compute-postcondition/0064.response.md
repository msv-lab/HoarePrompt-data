The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), and `a`, which is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9). After executing the function body, the output includes the following:
- `assigned` contains all elements from `a`.
- `m` is the number of times `can_form` was False.
- `n` is the length of `a`.
- `i` is the index of the last element checked.
- `can_form` is True if a difference was found, False otherwise.

If the first element of `a` cannot form any element in `assigned`, `m` starts at 2. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `m` remains at 1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, and based on the conditions described above, provide the values of `assigned`, `m`, `n`, `i`, and `can_form`.
