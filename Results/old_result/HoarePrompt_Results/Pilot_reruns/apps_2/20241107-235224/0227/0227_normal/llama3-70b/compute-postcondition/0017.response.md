Functionality: **The function `func` reads a positive integer `n` and a list of integers `a`, sorts the list `a`, and then iterates through the list to count how many elements are not twice the value of the previous element. The function then prints the count of such elements unless it exceeds 23, in which case it prints -1. The functionality does not calculate the factorial of `n` as indicated in the annotations.**
