Output State: 
- `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order and not empty
- `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`
- `m` is 1
- `i` is 1
- `n` is greater than 1
- If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.
- If `a[i] - x` is not found in `assigned` for any `x` in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False after the loop executes.
- If `n` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute.
