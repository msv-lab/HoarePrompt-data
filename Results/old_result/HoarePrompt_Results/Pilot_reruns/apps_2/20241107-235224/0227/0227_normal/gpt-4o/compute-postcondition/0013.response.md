Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order and not empty, `assigned` contains the next element of list `a` that has not been iterated over, `m` is 2, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. If `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
