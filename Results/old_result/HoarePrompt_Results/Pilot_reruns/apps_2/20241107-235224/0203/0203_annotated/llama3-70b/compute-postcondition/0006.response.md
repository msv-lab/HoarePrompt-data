Example Answer:
The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `remocrats` is 0. Therefore, after execution, `remocrats` is now 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, input fractions list contains at least 1 character, each being either 'D' or 'R'; `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 1**
