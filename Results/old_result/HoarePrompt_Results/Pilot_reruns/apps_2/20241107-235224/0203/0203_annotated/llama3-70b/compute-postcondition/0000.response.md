Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `n` is now a positive integer based on the precondition. The input fractions list contains `n` characters, each being either 'D' or 'R'. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, input fractions list contains `n` characters, each being either 'D' or 'R'.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, input fractions list contains `n` characters, each being either 'D' or 'R'**
