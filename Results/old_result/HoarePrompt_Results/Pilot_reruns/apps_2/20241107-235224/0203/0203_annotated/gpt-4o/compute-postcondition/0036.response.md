Output State: 
If both d_queue and r_queue are initially non-empty, the loop will continue to execute. After the loop finishes, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string, and r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string. If there are no 'D' characters, d_queue will be empty. If there are no 'R' characters, r_queue will contain the incremented value of r_index + n. d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character. If d_index < r_index, d_queue will be appended with d_index + n. If d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, r_queue will be appended with r_index + n.
The loop will stop executing if either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty at any point during its execution.

**If both d_queue and r_queue are initially non-empty, the loop will execute until either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty. After the loop finishes, the state of d_queue, r_queue, d_index, r_index, and n will be determined based on the specific values and relationships between the variables.**
