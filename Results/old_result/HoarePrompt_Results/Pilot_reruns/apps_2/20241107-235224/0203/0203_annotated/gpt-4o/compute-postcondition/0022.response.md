Postcondition: ***After the if-else block executes, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string, and r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string. If there are no 'D' characters, d_queue will be empty. If there are no 'R' characters, r_queue will contain the incremented value of r_index + n. d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character. If d_index < r_index, d_queue will be appended with d_index + n. If d_index is greater than or equal to r_index, r_queue will be appended with r_index + n.***
