Example Answer:
`r_index` is assigned the value of the first index in `r_queue` after popping it. If `r_queue` is not empty, `r_index` will contain the index of the popped 'R' character. If `r_queue` is empty, an error will occur. The states of other variables like `d_queue` and `d_index` are not affected.
Output State: **After the loop executes, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string, and r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters in the votes string. If there are no 'D' characters, d_queue will be empty. If there are no 'R' characters, r_queue will be empty. d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character.**
