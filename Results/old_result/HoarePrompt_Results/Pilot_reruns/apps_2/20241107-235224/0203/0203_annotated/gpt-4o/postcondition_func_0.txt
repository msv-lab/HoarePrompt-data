The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n`, where each character is either 'D' or 'R'. It then processes the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters in the string by adding the length `n` to the respective indices until one of the queues becomes empty. Finally, it prints 'D' if the 'D' queue is not empty, otherwise it prints 'R'. The function does not handle cases where both queues become empty simultaneously, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
