Example Answer:
`d_queue` appends `d_index + n`, where `d_index` is the popped value. The previous values of `d_queue`, `d_index`, and `n` are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `r_queue` is updated after removing the first element, `r_index` is assigned the popped value, and `d_queue` appends the result of `d_index + n`.
Output State: **`r_queue` is updated after removing the first element, `r_index` is assigned the popped value, `d_queue` appends the result of `d_index + n`**
