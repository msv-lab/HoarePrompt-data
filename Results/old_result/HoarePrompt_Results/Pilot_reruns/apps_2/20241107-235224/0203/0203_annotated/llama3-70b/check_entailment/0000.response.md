Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully adhere to the problem description. The code correctly calculates the number of 'D's and 'R's in the input list, but it does not simulate the voting process as described in the problem.

The voting process in the problem description involves employees taking turns to deny voting rights to other employees until only one employee is left to vote, based on their fraction. The code does not implement this dynamic voting process and only compares the total count of 'D's and 'R's in the input list to determine the outcome.

Therefore, the code does not cover all potential cases as described in the problem, making it incorrect.
