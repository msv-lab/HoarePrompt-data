Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` contains 0 if the first character in `votes` is 'D', otherwise `r_queue` contains 0. In both cases, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists, `i` is 0, and `v` is the first character in the `votes` string.***
