Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` and `r_queue` have values. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` appends the value of `d_index + n`, otherwise `r_queue` appends the value of `r_index + n`. In either case, `d_index` has the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is adjusted based on the popped values from `d_queue` and `r_queue`, and `r_index` is assigned the popped value from `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, the new value calculated from the addition of `d_index + n` is appended to `d_queue`.***
