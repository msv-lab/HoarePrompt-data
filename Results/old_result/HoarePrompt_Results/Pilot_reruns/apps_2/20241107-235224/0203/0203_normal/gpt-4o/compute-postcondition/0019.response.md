Example Answer: 
The value at index 0 is removed from `r_queue` and assigned to `r_index`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` may or may not have values depending on 'D' characters in `votes`, and `r_index` contains the value removed from `r_queue` at index 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` may or may not have values depending on 'D' characters in `votes`, and `r_index` contains the value removed from `r_queue` at index 0**
