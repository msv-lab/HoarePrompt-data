Example Answer: 
The value of `i` is appended to `r_queue`, and `r_queue` initially contains 0. After appending `i` which is 1, `r_queue` becomes [0, 1]. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` contains 0 if the first character in `votes` is 'D', `r_queue` is [0, 1], `i` is 1, and `v` is the second character in the `votes` string.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` contains 0 if the first character in `votes` is 'D', `r_queue` is [0, 1], `i` is 1, and `v` is the second character in the `votes` string**
