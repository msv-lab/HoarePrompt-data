Example Answer: 
`depublicans` is incremented by 1. Since the initial value of `depublicans` is 0, after execution, `depublicans` becomes 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is assigned the user input value, `depublicans` is 1, `remocrats` is 0**
