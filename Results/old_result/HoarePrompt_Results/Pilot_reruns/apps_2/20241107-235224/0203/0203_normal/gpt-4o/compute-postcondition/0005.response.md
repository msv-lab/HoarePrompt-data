Example Answer:
The value of `i` which is 0 is appended to the `d_queue` list. As a result, the `d_queue` list now contains the value 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` contains 0, `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string**
