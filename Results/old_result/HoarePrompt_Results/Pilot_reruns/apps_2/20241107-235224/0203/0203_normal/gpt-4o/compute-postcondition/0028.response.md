Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` and `r_queue` have values. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` includes `d_index + n` and `r_queue` remains unchanged. Otherwise, `r_queue` includes `r_index + n` and `d_queue` remains unchanged. In all cases, `d_index` is adjusted based on the popped value from `d_queue` and `r_index` is updated with the popped value from `r_queue`.***
