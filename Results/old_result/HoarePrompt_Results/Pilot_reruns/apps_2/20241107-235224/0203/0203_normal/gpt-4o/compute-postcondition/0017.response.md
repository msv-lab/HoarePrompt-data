Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character. The loop iterates through the `votes` string, adding the index of each 'D' character to the `d_queue` list and the index of each 'R' character to the `r_queue` list. If there are no 'D' characters in `votes`, `d_queue` remains empty. If there are no 'R' characters in `votes`, `r_queue` remains empty.**
