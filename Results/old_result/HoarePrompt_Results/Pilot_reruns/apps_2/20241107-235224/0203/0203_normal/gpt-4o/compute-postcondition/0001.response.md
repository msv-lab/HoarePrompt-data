Example Answer:
The variable `votes` is assigned the input string after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The input contains only characters 'D' and 'R'. Therefore, the length of the string `votes` is equal to the input integer `n`. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n containing only characters 'D' and 'R'**
