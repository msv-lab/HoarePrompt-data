Example Answer: 
The variable `d_queue` is initialized as an empty list. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n containing only characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n containing only characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list**
