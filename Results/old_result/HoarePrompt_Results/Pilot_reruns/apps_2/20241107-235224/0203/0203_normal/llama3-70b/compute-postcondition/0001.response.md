Example Answer:
The variable `fractions` is assigned the user input value. The value of `n` is not impacted by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is assigned the user input value.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is assigned the user input value**
