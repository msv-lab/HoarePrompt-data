Example Answer:
`remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` has at least one more element, and the party count `remocrats` is updated.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000, `fractions` has at least one more element, and the party count `remocrats` is updated**
