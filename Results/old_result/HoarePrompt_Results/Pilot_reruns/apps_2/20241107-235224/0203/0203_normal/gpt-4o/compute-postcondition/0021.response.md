Example Answer:
`r_index` is added to `n` and the result is appended to the list `r_queue`. The output state is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` may or may not have values depending on 'D' characters in `votes`, `r_index` contains the value removed from `r_queue` at index 0, and `r_queue` contains the result of appending `r_index + n`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` may or may not have values depending on 'D' characters in `votes`, `r_index` contains the value removed from `r_queue` at index 0, `r_queue` contains the result of appending `r_index + n`**
