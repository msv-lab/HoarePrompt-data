Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `votes` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n containing only characters 'D' and 'R'**.
Output State: **n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n containing only characters 'D' and 'R'**
