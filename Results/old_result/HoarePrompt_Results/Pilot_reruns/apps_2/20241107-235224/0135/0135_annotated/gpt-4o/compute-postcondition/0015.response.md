Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 
- Case 1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function always returns 'No'. 
- Case 2: If k is less than n, the function iterates k times, calculating the remainder of n divided by i for each iteration. If a remainder is already in the set of seen remainders, the function returns 'No'. If no repeated remainders are found, the function returns 'Yes'. 
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to determine if there are any repeated remainders when dividing n by numbers from 1 to k (inclusive) and return 'Yes' if there are none, or 'No' if there are repeated remainders.**
