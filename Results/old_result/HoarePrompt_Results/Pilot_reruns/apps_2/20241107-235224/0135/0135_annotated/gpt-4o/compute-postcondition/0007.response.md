According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, and `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. To execute the loop one more time, `k` must be adjusted to `k + 1`.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, and `k` is greater than or equal to `n` with `k` adjusted to `k + 1**`.
