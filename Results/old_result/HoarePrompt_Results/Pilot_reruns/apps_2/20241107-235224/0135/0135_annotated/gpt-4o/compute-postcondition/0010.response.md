Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`. The variables `n` and `i` are not defined in the initial state, so the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to `n` adjusted to `k + 1, and `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18, `k` is greater than or equal to `n` adjusted to `k + 1, and `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`**
