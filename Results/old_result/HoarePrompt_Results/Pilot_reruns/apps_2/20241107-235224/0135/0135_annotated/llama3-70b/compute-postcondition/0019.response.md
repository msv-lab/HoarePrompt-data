Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing all previously seen remainders including the newly added `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`, and `remainder` is added to the `seen` set. If `remainder` is already in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits without altering the state of the variables.**
