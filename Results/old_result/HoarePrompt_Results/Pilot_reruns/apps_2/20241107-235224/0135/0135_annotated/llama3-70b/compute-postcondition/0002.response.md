According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, `n` is an integer and `seen` is an empty set, so the states need to be adjusted such that `k` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1 at the start of the loop.
State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
