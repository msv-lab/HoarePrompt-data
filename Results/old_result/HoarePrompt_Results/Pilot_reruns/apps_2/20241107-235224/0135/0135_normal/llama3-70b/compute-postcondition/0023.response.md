The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates the result of n^k (n raised to the power of k) and returns the result. The function assumes that n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the result of n^k, where n and k are integers within the specified range.
