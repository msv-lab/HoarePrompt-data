Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of the modulo operation `n % i`, where `n` and `i` are input integers and `i` is 1. The value of `n` modulo 1 will always be 0, so `remainder` will be 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0**
