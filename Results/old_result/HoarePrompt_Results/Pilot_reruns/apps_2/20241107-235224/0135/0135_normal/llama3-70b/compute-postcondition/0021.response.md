Output State: **If k is less than 1, the loop won't execute. If the remainder of n divided by i is already in seen, the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, the remainder is added to seen. After the loop executes, n and k are input integers, seen is a set containing unique remainders, i is the last value of the loop iteration, and remainder is the remainder of dividing n by i.**
