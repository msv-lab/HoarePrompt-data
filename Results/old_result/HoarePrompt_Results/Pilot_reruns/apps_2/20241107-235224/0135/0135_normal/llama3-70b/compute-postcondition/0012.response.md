Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is initially an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0. If the `remainder` is present in the `seen` set, 'No' is printed and the program exits. Otherwise, the program continues execution with the updated values of `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` remaining the same.***
