Example Answer:
The variable `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % i`, where `n` is not defined in the initial state. Since `n` is not defined, the value of `remainder` cannot be calculated. Therefore, the output state is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is greater than or equal to 0, `i` is 1**
