Functionality: **The function `func_1` takes two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where 1 <= n, k <= 10^18. It first checks if k is greater than or equal to n, in which case it returns 'No'. Then, it iterates through integers from 1 to k, calculating remainders of n divided by each integer. If any remainder is repeated, the function returns 'No'. If no remainders are repeated, the function returns 'Yes'. The function aims to determine if there are any repeating remainders when dividing n by integers from 1 to k and provides the respective responses 'Yes' or 'No' based on the calculations.**
