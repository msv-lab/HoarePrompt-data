According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i`, and `remainder` are input integers, an empty set, 1, 0, and 0 respectively. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to be the next integer after the last iteration, which is 1 in this case. No other states need to be adjusted.
