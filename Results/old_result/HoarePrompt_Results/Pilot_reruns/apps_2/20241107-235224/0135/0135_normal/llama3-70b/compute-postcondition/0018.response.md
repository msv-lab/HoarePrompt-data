Postcondition: ***`n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is the set containing only `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2. If the `remainder` is already in the set `seen`, then the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables and the program continues without any alterations.***
