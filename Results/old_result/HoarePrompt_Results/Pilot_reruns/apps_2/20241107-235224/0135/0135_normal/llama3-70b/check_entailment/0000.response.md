Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from input. It then iterates from 1 to `k` inclusive, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. If a remainder is repeated, it prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, it prints 'Yes' at the end. The code aligns with the problem description as it checks if all the remainders are distinct and outputs 'Yes' if they are, 'No' otherwise. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that it handles the given scenario correctly. The code covers all potential cases as specified in the problem description.
