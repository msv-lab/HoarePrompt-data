Output State: **The loop calculates the prefix sum of balances in the string `s`. For each index `i`, `prefix_balances[i]` is the sum of the balances from the beginning of the string up to index `i`. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop won't execute, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros. `results` list appends a 0.**
