Output State: **T is incremented by 2, n and x are assigned integer values from the input after splitting by space. balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1. If balance is equal to x, then the code prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, the code prints -1. Otherwise, if (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) != 0, the code prints (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1.**
