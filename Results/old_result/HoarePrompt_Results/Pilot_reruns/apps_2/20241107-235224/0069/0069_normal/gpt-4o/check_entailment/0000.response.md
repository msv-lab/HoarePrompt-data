Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_1` correctly reads the input data for each test case, calculates the balance of the string, and then determines the number of prefixes of the infinite string `t` with a balance equal to `x`.
- It handles the scenario where the balance is zero and checks if the desired balance `x` is present in the prefix balances, returning -1 if so. Otherwise, it returns 0.
- For non-zero balances, the code correctly counts the number of prefixes with the desired balance by iterating through the prefix balances and checking if the difference between the desired balance `x` and the prefix balance is divisible by the balance of the string. It increments the count accordingly.
- The code accounts for all potential cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each test case. The output hints also align with the code functionality, confirming its correctness.
