Example Answer:
`index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is unknown, so after execution, `index` is increased by 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, `results` is an empty list, `index` is increased by 3.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, `results` is an empty list, `index` is increased by 3**
