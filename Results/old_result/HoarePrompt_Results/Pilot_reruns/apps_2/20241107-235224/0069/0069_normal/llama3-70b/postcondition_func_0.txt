The function `func` reads a positive integer `T` from input and then iterates `T` times. For each iteration, it reads integers `n` and `x`, a string `s`, and calculates the count of '0's and '1's in `s`. It then determines the balance as the difference between the counts. If the balance is equal to `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)` is 0, it prints -1. Otherwise, it calculates and prints `((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1)) + 1`. The function handles different cases based on these conditions and provides the corresponding output. If `T` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and no values are processed.
