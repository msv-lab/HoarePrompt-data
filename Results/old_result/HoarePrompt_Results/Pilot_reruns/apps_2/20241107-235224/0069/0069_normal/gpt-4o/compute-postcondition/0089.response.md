Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is 0, so after execution, `count` becomes 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element, `count` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 1, `prefix_balances` contains at least 1 element, `count` is 1**
