Example Answer:
`balance` is calculated as the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`. The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input after splitting by space, and `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input after splitting by space, and `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1**.
