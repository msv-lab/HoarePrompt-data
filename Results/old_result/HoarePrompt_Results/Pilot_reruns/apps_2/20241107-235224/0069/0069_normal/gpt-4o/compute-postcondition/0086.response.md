Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value and `s[i - 1]` until `i` reaches `n + 1`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. `x` and `s` remain unchanged. If `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1. Otherwise, `results` contains an additional element with the value 0.***
