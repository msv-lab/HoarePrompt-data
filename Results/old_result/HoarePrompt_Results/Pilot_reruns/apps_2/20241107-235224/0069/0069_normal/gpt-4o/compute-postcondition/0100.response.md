Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value and `s[i - 1]` until `i` reaches `n + 1`. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute. `x` and `s` remain unchanged. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains -1. If `balance` is 0, and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains 0. If `balance` is not 0, `results` contains the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that meet the conditions specified.***
