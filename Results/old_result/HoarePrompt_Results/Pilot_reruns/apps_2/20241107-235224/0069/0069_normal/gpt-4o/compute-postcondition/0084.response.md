Example Answer:
The code snippet appends -1 to the list results. This action does not affect the variables n, prefix_balances, x, or s. Therefore, the Output State is: If n is greater than or equal to 1, prefix_balances[i] is updated based on the previous value and s[i - 1] until i reaches n + 1. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute. x and s remain unchanged. The list results now contains -1.
Output State: **If n is greater than or equal to 1, prefix_balances[i] is updated based on the previous value and s[i - 1] until i reaches n + 1. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute. x and s remain unchanged. results contain -1**
