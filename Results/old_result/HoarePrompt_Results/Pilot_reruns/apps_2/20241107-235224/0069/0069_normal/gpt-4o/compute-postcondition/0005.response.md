According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `data` is a list of strings, `T` is an integer, `index` is 1, and `results` is an empty list. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `T` needs to be greater than 0, and `_` (which is a placeholder variable) should be 0.
State: **`data` is a list of strings, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
