Postcondition: ***After the if statement is executed, the variable `count` is incremented by 1. The list `prefix_balances` still contains at least 2 elements. The `results` list will contain updated values after the loop. The `index` variable remains at 3. The variable `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances. Additionally, if the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is increased by 1.***
