Example Answer:
`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, where `index + 2` refers to the next index in the data array. The value of `n` is not impacted, but `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer that meets the loop condition for one more iteration, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `s` is the value at `data[index + 2]`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer that meets the loop condition for one more iteration, `x` is the integer value of `data[index + 1]`, `s` is the value at `data[index + 2]`**
