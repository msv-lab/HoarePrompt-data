Output State: **`prefix_balances` has at least 2 elements, `x` is assigned the integer value at data[index + 1], `s` is assigned the value at data[index + 2], `balance` is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in string s, `count` is either 0 or 1 based on the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0, `results` remains empty, and `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `count` is incremented by 1**
