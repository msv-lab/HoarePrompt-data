Example Answer:
The value 0 is appended to the list results. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: If n is at least 1, then prefix_balances contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in s up to each index. If n is 0, prefix_balances remains a list of zeros; results contains a single 0 appended.
Output State: **If n is at least 1, then prefix_balances contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's in s up to each index. If n is 0, prefix_balances remains a list of zeros; results contains a single 0 appended**
