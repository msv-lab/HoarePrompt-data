Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 3, n and x are integers entered by the user, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1, s is a string entered by the user, cnt0 and cnt1 are the counts of '0' and '1' characters in string s. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, then print -1. Otherwise, print the result of ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1)) + 1. This covers all possible cases including when the denominator is zero, ensuring the program handles all edge cases effectively.***
