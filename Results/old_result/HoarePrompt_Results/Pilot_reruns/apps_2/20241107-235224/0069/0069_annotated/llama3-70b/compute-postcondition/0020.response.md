Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 2, n and x are integers entered by the user, balance is the difference between cnt0 and cnt1, s is a string entered by the user, cnt0 and cnt1 are the counts of '0' and '1' characters in string s. If balance is equal to x, the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program calculates ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) and prints the result. The overall state of the program after the if else block is executed covers scenarios where the division is valid, invalid, and when the result is negative, zero, or positive, ensuring all possible edge cases are accounted for.***
