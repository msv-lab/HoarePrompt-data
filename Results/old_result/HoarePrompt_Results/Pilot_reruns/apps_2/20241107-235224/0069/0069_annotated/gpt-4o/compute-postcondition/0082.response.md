According to the code, the loop executes for values of `i` from 1 to `n`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list where the `i-th` element is the sum of the `i-1-th` element and 1 if `s[i-1]` is '0', otherwise subtract 1. Additionally, `i` is less than or equal to `n+2`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to `n + 1` and the `prefix_balances` list needs to be updated according to the described logic for the next iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where the `n+1-th` element is the sum of the `n-th` element and 1 if `s[n]` is '0', otherwise subtract 1, `i` is equal to `n + 1`, `n` remains the same**
