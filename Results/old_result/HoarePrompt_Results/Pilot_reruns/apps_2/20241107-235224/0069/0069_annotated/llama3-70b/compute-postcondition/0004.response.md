Example Answer:
The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0' and '1' characters in the string `s` respectively. The previous values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer entered by the user, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are the counts of '0' and '1' characters in string `s`.
Output State: **T is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is an integer entered by the user, `x` is an integer entered by the user, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are the counts of '0' and '1' characters in string `s`**
