Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input for the number of test cases and then for each test case, it calculates the balance of 0's and 1's in the given string. It then checks if the balance is equal to the desired balance. If it is, then it prints the length of the string plus 1. If not, it checks if the difference between the desired balance and the calculated balance is a multiple of the difference between the count of 0's and 1's in the string. If yes, then it prints -1, indicating an infinite number of prefixes. Otherwise, it calculates the number of prefixes required to achieve the desired balance and prints it.

The program handles all possible cases as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
