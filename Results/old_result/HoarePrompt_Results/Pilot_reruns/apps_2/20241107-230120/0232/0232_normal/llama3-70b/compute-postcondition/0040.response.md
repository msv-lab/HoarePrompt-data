Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with at least one color and its corresponding count, `colors` is not an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `i+1` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i+2`, `color` is the color at index `j` in the list `colors`. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value of 0.***
