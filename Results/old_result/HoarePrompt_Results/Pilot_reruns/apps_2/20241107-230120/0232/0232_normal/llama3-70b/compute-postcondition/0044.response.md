Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with at least one color and its corresponding count, `colors` is not an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `i+1` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i+2`, `color` is the color at index `j` in the list `colors`. If `color` was not already in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value of 0 and incremented by 1. After the execution of the code, if all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
