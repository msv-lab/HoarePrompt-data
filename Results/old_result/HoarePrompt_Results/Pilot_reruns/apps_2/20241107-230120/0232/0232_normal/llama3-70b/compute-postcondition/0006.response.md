Postcondition: ***n and m are positive integers. colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers, counts is a list of integers containing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color. color_counts is a dictionary with color as key and value 0. The dictionary color_counts is updated such that if color was not already present, it is added with a value of 0. All other colors in color_counts remain unchanged.***
