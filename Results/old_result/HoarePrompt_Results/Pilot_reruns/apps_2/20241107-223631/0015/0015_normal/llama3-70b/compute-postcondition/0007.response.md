Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the specified range. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, then 'YES' is printed. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, then 'NO' is printed. If the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain integers within the specified range after the execution of the if-else block, covering all possible edge cases and maintaining their initial conditions.***
