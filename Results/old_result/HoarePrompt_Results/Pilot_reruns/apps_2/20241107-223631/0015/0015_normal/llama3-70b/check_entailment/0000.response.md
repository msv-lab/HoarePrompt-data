Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the problem description. It checks for different cases:
- If `c` is 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, it prints 'YES'.
- If `c` is 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, it prints 'NO'.
- If the condition `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0` is satisfied, it prints 'YES'.
- Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.

The code also handles the edge case of dividing by zero by checking if `c` is 0 before performing any division operation. The conditions provided cover all the possibilities as described in the problem statement, making the code correct.
