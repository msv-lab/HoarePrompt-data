Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the specified range. If `a` is equal to `b`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The program maintains the initial state of `a`, `b`, and `c` as integers within the specified range after the execution of the if-else block, covering all possible edge cases.***
