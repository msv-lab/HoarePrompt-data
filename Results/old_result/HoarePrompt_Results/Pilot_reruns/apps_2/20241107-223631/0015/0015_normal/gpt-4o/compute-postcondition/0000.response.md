Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The values can be any integers within the given range. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers such that -10^9 <= a, b, c <= 10^9**
