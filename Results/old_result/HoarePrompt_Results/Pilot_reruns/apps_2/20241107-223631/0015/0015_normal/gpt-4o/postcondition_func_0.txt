The function `func` reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. If `b` is equal to `a`, it prints 'YES'. If `c` is 0, it prints 'NO'. If the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the quotient is non-negative, it prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not have a specified return value.
