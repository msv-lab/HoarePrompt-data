Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly checks whether Vasya's favorite number b appears in the sequence or not. It considers all possible cases such as b being equal to the first element of the sequence, the difference between elements being 0, and calculates whether b can be reached from the starting element using the given difference. The conditions cover all the scenarios mentioned in the problem description, hence the program is correct for all potential cases.
