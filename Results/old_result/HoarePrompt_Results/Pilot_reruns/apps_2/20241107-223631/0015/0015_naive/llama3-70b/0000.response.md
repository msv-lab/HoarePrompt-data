Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If c is equal to 0, the only way for b to appear in the sequence is if a is also equal to b. This is correctly handled in the program.
2. If c is not 0, the program correctly checks if (b - a) is divisible by c and if the result is greater than or equal to 0 for b to appear in the sequence.
