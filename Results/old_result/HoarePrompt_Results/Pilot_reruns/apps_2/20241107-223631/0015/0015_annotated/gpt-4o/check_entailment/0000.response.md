Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program correctly implements the problem description. It handles the cases where Vasya's favorite number `b` is equal to the first element of the sequence `a`, where the difference between consecutive elements is `0`, and where `b` can be reached from `a` with a difference of `c` in a valid manner. The code covers all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case. The annotations also align with the logic of the code and do not raise any concerns regarding the correctness of the program.
