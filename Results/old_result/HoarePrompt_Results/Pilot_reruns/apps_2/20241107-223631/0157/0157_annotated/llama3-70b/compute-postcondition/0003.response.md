Example Answer:
`min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` can vary within the given constraints. After execution, `min_lemon` will hold the smallest among the three calculated values. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and `min_lemon` holds the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` holds the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
