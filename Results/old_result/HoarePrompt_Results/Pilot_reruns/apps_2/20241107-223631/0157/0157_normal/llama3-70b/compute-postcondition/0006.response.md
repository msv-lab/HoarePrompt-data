Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three positive integers `a`, `b`, and `c` as input. It then calculates the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and prints the result of the expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. The function does not return any value. The annotations indicate that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers within the range 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000. However, it is important to note that the function lacks a return statement and does not explicitly return any value. **
