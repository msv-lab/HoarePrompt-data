Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state specifies that `a` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, the value of `a` after input will also be a positive integer within the specified range.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000**
