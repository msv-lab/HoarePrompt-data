Example Answer:
`min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The initial state does not mention the value of `a`, so assume `a` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is `b` is an input integer, `c` is another input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
Output State: **`b` is an input integer, `c` is another input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4**.
