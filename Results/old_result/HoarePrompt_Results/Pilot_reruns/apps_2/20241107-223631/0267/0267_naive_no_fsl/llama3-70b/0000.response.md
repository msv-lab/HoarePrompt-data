Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` that calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. The function uses dynamic programming to efficiently count the numbers that meet the criteria. The implementation of the `count` function correctly calculates the count of numbers satisfying the condition. The main function then calculates the sum by subtracting the count for `l-1` from the count for `r` and taking the modulus.

The program also reads the input, calls the `func_1` function, and prints the result, which follows the input and output requirements specified in the problem description. 

Overall, the program logic aligns with the problem description, and it handles all potential cases as specified.
