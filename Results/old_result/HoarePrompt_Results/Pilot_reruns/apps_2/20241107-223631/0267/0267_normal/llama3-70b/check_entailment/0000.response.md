Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. It fails to handle the case where the number of different digits is equal to 1. For example, if $l = 10$ and $r = 50$ with $k = 1$, the code should calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. However, the code does not account for this scenario and does not provide the correct result. This discrepancy between the code behavior and the problem description makes the code incorrect.
