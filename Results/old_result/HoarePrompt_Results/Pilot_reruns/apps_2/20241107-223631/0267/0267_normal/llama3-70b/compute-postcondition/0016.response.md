Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values. If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value stored at that key. If n is less than 10 ** k, the value stored at key (n, k) in dp is updated to n. If n is greater than or equal to 10 ** k, the value stored at key (n, k) in dp is updated based on the calculations in the else part. If k is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute. If k is greater than 1, n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary with an updated value at key (n, k), i is 1 after the loop executes once, and i is 2 after the loop executes twice. The value stored at key (n, k) in the dictionary dp is updated to be the result of taking the modulus of its current value with MOD.***
