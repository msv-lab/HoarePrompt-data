Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then applying the modulo operation with `MOD`. Since the initial value of `num` is `r + 1`, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(total_sum + r + 1) % MOD`. The variables `l` and `r` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and applying modulo operation with `MOD`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `r + 1`**
