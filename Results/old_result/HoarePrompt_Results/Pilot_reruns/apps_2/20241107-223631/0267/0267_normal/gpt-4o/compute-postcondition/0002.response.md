Example Answer: 
`total_sum` is updated by adding the value of `num` and then taking the modulus `MOD`. The previous value of `total_sum` is 0, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `num` is equal to `l`. After execution, `total_sum` will be the sum of all numbers from `l` to `r` modulo `MOD`. 
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated to the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` modulo `MOD`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`**
