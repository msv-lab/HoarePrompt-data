According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to `k`, which means the loop will not execute one more time. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `k`. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values, and `i` is 1.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values, `i` is 1**
