The function `func_2` accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`. It iterates through the inclusive range from `l` to `r`, checks the output of `func_1(num, k)` for each `num` in the range, and updates `total_sum` accordingly by adding the particular `num` and applying modulo `MOD`. If `func_1(num, k)` always returns false for the entire range, `total_sum` remains 0. The function returns the final value of `total_sum`. Edge cases and missing functionality such as what happens if the inputs do not meet the specified constraints are not explicitly covered in the annotations.
