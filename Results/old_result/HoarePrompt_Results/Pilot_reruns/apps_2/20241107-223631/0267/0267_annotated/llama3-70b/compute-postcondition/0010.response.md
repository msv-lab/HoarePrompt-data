According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary with updated values, and `i` is 2. The loop needs to be adjusted so that `i` is 3 to execute one more time.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary with updated values, i is 3, and the updated value of dp[n, k]**
