According to the code, the loop can execute again if the current `num` is within the range `[l, r]`. At the end of the last iteration, the states are updated based on the condition of `func_1(num, k)`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `num` is updated to the next number after the current value, and `l` and `r` are modified accordingly. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, there are no changes to `total_sum`, `num`, `l`, or `r`. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next `num` value within the range `[l, r]` needs to be determined based on the condition of `func_1(num, k)`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true for the next `num` value, then `total_sum`, `num`, `l`, and `r` need to be updated accordingly. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false for the next `num` value, then no changes are required.

State: **`total_sum`, `num`, `l`, and `r` are updated based on the condition of `func_1(num, k)` for the next `num` value within the range `[l, r] after the last iteration.**
