Example Answer:
The `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulus by `MOD`. The previous values of `total_sum` and `num` are unknown, so the new value of `total_sum` is dependent on those unknown values. The variables `l` and `r` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated based on the condition; `num` is updated to the next number after the current value; `l` and `r` are modified accordingly**
