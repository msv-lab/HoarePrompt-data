Postcondition: ***`total_sum`, `num`, `l`, and `r` are all updated based on the condition of `func_1(num, k)`. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `num` is updated to the next number after the current value, and `l` and `r` are modified accordingly. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, there are no changes to `total_sum`, `num`, `l`, or `r`.***
