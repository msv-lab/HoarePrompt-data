According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. Additionally, `l` and `r` are updated based on the conditions provided, and `num` is updated accordingly after the execution of the program fragment.

To execute the loop one more time, the `num` needs to be updated to the next number after the current value. Therefore, the next value of `num` should be calculated taking into account the current value of `num`. 

State: **`total_sum` is updated based on the condition, `num` is updated to the next number after the current value, `l` and `r` are modified accordingly**
