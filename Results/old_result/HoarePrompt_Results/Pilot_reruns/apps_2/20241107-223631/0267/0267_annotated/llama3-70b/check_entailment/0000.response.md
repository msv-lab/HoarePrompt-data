Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code consists of two functions, `func_1` and `count`, where `func_1` calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits, and `count` is a helper function used for computation.
2. The `count` function handles the calculation of the count of numbers satisfying the given condition within the specified range.
3. The `func_1` function utilizes the `count` function to calculate the final result based on the provided inputs `l`, `r`, and `k`.
4. The logic implemented in the functions aligns with the problem description, ensuring that the sum of numbers meeting the criteria is correctly calculated and returned modulo `998244353`.
5. The annotations provide insights into the state of the program variables and the logic flow, confirming that the code handles different scenarios as described in the problem statement.
6. The examples provided in the problem description are also correctly implemented in the code, further validating its correctness.
