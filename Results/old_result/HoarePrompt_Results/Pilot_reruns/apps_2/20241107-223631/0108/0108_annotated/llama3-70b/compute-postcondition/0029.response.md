Example Answer:
`res` is concatenated with the value of `char`, and `char` is then incremented by 1. The initial value of `char` is unknown, so the output state is: if char is in s, then res contains the original value of char before replacement, char is further incremented by 1.
Output State: **if char is in s, then res contains the original value of char before replacement, char is further incremented by 1**
