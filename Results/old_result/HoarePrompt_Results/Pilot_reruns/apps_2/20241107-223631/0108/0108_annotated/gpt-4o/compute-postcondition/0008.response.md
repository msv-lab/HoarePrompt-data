Example Answer:
`j` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `j` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of English lowercase letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is equal to `target[0]`.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of English lowercase letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` is equal to `target[0]`.**
