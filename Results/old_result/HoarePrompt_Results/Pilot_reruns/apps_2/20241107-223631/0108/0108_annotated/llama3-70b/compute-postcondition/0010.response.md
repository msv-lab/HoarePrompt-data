Example Answer:
The value of `char` is appended to the string `res`. The previous value of `res` is unknown, but `char` still exists in the modified string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with characters replaced accordingly, `res` is appended with the original value of `char`, and `char` is still in the modified string `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string with characters replaced accordingly, `res` is appended with the original value of `char`, and `char` is still in the modified string `s`**
