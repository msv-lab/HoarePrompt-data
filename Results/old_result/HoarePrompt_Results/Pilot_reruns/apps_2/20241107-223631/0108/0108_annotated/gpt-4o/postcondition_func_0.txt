The function `func` reads a string `s` consisting of English lowercase letters and iterates through it to check if it contains all the letters in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in order. If the letters are present in order, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If the letters are not in order or some are missing, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
