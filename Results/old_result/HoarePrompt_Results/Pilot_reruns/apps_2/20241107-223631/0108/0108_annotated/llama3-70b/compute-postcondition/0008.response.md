Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the character that is one greater in ASCII value. The variable `res` is then appended with the original value of `char`. Therefore, after execution, the modified string `s` and the updated `res` variable are the new states.
Output State: **`s` is a string with characters replaced accordingly, `res` is appended with the original value of `char`**
