Functionality: **The function reads a string `s` consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive). It then iterates through the alphabet, replacing characters in `s` with their next alphabet character and storing the original characters in `res`. If all characters in the alphabet are replaced in `s`, it prints out `res`. If not all characters are replaced, it prints -1. This ensures the handling of both complete and incomplete character replacement scenarios.**
