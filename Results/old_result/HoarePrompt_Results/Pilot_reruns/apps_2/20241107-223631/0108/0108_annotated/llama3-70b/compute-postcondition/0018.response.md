Example Answer: 
The value of `res` is concatenated with the value of `char`. Since the original value of `res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement, the new value of `res` will be the original value of `char` followed by the value of `char` itself. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement followed by the value of `char`.
Output State: **`res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement followed by the value of `char`**
