According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `char` is in `s`, then `res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement, `char` is further incremented by 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `char` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **if `char` is in `s`, then `res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement, `char` is further incremented by 2**
