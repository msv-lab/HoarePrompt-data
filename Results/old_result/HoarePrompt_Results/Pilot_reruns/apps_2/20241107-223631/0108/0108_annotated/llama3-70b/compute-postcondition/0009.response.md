According to the code, the loop can execute again if the character `char` is found in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with characters replaced accordingly and `res` is appended with the original value of `char`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the state that needs to be adjusted is to make sure that `char` is still in the modified string `s`.
State: **`s` is a string with characters replaced accordingly, `res` is appended with the original value of `char` and `char` is still in the modified string `s`**
