According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `char` is in `s`, then `res` contains the original value of `char` before replacement and `char` is further incremented by 1. If `char` is not in `s` at the beginning, the loop will not execute. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `char` needs to be incremented by 1 and it must be in `s`.
State: **if `char + 1` is in `s`, then `res` contains the original value of `char + 1` before replacement, `char` is further incremented by 1**
