Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes a string `s` as input, iterates through each character in the alphabet, replaces that character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet if it is present, and builds the result string `res`. If the length of `res` is equal to 26 (the length of the alphabet), then it prints `res` which contains all the characters that were replaced in `s`. Otherwise, it prints -1. The code follows the problem description by ensuring that the final result contains the English alphabet as a subsequence and handles the case where it is impossible to obtain the desired result.
