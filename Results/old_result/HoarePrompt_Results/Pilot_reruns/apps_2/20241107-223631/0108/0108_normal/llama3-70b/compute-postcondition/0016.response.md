Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. Only the first occurrence is replaced. The updated `s` now contains the next character after the last character processed from `alphabet`. The characters appended in each iteration are stored in `res`. 
Output State: **`s` contains the next character after the last character processed from `alphabet`; `res` contains characters appended in each iteration**
