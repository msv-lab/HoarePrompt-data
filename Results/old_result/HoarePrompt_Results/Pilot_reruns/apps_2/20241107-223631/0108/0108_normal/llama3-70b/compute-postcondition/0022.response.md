Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the next character in the alphabet using `s.replace(char, chr(ord(char) + 1), 1)`, where `ord` gets the ASCII value of the character, `chr` converts it back to a character, and `1` specifies to replace only the first occurrence. The `res` variable will contain the characters that were appended in each iteration including `char`. 
Output State: **`s` contains the character after the first occurrence of `char` in the alphabet, `res` contains characters appended in each iteration including `char`**
