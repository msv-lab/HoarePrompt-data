Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the character whose ASCII value is one greater than `char`. The replacement occurs only once. The updated string is stored in `s`. The output state is: `s` is an updated string with the character replaced by the next ASCII character, `res` is an updated string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined as a string containing all lowercase English letters.
Output State: **`s` is an updated string with the character replaced by the next ASCII character, `res` is an updated string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined as a string containing all lowercase English letters**
