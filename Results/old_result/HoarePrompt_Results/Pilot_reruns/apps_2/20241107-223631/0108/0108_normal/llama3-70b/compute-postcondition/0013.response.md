The loop updates the string `s` by replacing each occurrence of the character `char` with the next ASCII character. The loop appends the original `char` to the string `res` in each iteration.

Potential Edge Cases:
- If `s` is an empty string initially, the loop will not execute.
- If `s` does not contain the character `char`, the loop will not execute.

Output State: **If s is not empty and contains char, res will be the characters appended in each iteration, s will have char replaced by the next ASCII character, alphabet is defined as a string containing all lowercase English letters. If s is empty or does not contain char, the loop won't execute.**
