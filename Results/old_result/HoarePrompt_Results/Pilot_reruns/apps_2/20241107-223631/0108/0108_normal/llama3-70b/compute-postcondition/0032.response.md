Example Answer:
The value of `char` is appended to the end of `res`. The value of `char` is in `s`, so after execution, `res` will have the updated value with `char` appended to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `char` is appended to `res` and `char` is in `s`.
Output State: **`char` is appended to `res` and `char` is in `s`**
