According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `target`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is 2**
