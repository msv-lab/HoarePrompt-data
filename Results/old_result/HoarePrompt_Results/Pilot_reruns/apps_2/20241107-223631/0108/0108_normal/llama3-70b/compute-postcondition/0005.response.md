Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced with the character that is one position ahead in the alphabet. The `char` variable can have any lowercase English letter value. After replacing the character, the updated string `res` contains the modified string. The variable `alphabet` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is an updated string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined as a string containing all lowercase English letters**
