Example Answer:
The character `char` in string `s` is replaced by the next ASCII character of `char`. The replacement is done only once. The updated `s` now contains the character replaced by the next ASCII character. The variable `res` remains unchanged. The `alphabet` variable is not affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`s` is an updated string with the character replaced by the next ASCII character, `res` is an updated string with the appended character, `alphabet` is defined as a string containing all lowercase English letters**
