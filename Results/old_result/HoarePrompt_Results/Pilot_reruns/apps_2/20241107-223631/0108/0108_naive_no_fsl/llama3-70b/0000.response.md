Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input string `s`, then iterates through the English alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it replaces occurrences of that character in the input string `s` with the next character in the alphabet, until all characters in the alphabet have been found in the input string. If the resulting string `res` has a length of 26 (equal to the length of the alphabet), it prints the string, otherwise it prints -1.
The program follows the problem description and correctly outputs the expected result for all potential cases.
