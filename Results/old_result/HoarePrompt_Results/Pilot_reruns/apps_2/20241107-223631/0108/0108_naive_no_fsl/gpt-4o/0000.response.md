Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly iterates through the input string and the target string to check if the input string can form a subsequence of the target string by replacing characters with the next alphabetical character. If the entire target string is found in the input string, it prints the target string, otherwise it prints -1. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and it covers all potential cases.
