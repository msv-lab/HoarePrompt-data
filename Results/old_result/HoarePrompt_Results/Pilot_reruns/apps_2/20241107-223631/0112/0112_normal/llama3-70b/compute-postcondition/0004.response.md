Example Answer:
Each digit of the cube is converted to a string and added to the set `digits`. The set `digits` is updated with all the digits from each cube in the list `cubes`. Since the cubes list has at least 1 cube, the set `digits` will contain all unique digits from all cubes.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, digits is a set containing unique digits from all cubes**
