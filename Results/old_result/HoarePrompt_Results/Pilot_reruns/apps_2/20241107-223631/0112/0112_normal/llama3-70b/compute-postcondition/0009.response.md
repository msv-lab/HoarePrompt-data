According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list of cubes. If the list has at least 4 cubes, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, digits is a set containing unique digits from all cubes. So for the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 4 cubes.
State: **n is a positive integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 4 cubes, digits is a set containing unique digits from all cubes**
