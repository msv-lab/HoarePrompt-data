According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are more cubes in the list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, digits is a set containing unique digits from all cubes. For the loop to execute one more time, the list of cubes must have at least 3 cubes.
State: **n is a positive integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, digits is a set containing unique digits from all cubes**
