Example Answer: 
The set `digits` is initialized as an empty set. Since no cubes or integers are processed, the set `digits` remains empty. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9; digits is an empty set.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9; digits is an empty set**
