Example Answer:
The positive integer `num` is converted to a string, then converted to a list of digits and assigned to `digits`. The value of `num` is used only for this conversion, and `n` and `cube_faces` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: num is a positive integer, n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cube_faces is a list of lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube, digits is a list containing the individual digits of num.
Output State: **num is a positive integer, n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cube_faces is a list of lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube, digits is a list containing the individual digits of num**
