Example Answer: 
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of characters obtained by converting the integer `num` to a string and then converting each character to an element of the list. The previous values of the affected variables are `n` representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` representing the faces of each cube, and `num` as a positive integer. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube, num is a positive integer, digits is a list of characters obtained from converting num to a string**.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube, num is a positive integer, digits is a list of characters obtained from converting num to a string**.
