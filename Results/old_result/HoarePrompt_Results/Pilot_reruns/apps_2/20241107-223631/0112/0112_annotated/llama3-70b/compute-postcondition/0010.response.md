Output State: **The loop updates the set `digits` with unique string digits from each cube in the list `cubes`. If `cubes` is a list with at least one cube, the loop will execute at least once, and `digits` will contain the unique string digits of the first cube. If `cubes` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `digits` remains an empty set.**
