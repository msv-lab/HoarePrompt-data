The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer between 1 and 3, and `cubes`, a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of a cube. The function iterates through increasing numbers starting from 0 until the condition `can_form_number(x + 1)` is false. If this condition is true for n times, where n is the value of `n`, then x is increased by the sum of the first n positive integers. If the condition is false initially, x remains unchanged.
