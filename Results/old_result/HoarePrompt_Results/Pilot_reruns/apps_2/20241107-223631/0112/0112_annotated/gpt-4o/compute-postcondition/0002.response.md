According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are: `n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting num to a string with at least 1 digit, and `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values initialized to False.
