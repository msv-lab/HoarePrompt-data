Postcondition: ***If n is 0 or less, the loop does not execute. If n is greater than 0 and a cube with the digit is found during the iteration, the corresponding boolean value in used_cubes is set to True, and found is set to True. The loop breaks as soon as a cube with the digit is found. The final output state includes n, cube_faces, num, digits, used_cubes with values updated based on the loop execution, found indicating if a cube with the digit was found, and i representing the iteration count. If found is True after the loop execution, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.***
