Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `max_num`, which is the integer obtained by sorting the digits in descending order and joining them together. The set `digits` contains unique string digits of cube(s) without '0'. The output state is `digits` contains unique string digits of cube(s) without '0', `max_num` is the integer value obtained by sorting the digits in descending order and joining them together.
Output State: **`digits` contains unique string digits of cube(s) without '0', `max_num` is the integer value obtained by sorting the digits in descending order and joining them together**
