According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `found` is set to True if the condition is met, and `i` is 0. 

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that `i` is less than `n`. Therefore, the only state that needs adjustment is `i`, which should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting num to a string with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values, `found` is set to True if the condition is met, and `i` is 1**
