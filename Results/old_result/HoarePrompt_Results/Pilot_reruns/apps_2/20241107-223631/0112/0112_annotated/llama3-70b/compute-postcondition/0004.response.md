Example Answer:
The code iterates through each digit in the first cube in the list of cubes and converts it to a string before adding it to the set `digits`. Since the cube is a list of lists and the first cube is being used, the digits in the first cube are converted to strings and added to the set `digits`. The set `digits` is updated with the new digits. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the digits of the first cube as strings, `cube` is the first cube in the list of cubes.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 1 cube, `digits` is a set containing the digits of the first cube as strings, `cube` is the first cube in the list of cubes**
