According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list of cubes. If the list has at least 3 cubes, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 2 cubes, `digits` is a set containing unique string digits of the first cube, and `cube` is the first cube in the list of cubes. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the list of cubes must have at least 3 cubes, and the cube being iterated should be the second cube in the list.
State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists with at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing unique string digits of the second cube, and `cube` is the second cube in the list of cubes**
