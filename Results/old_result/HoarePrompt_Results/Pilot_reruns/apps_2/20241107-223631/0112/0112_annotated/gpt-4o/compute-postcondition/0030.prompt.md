You have been assigned the task of a program verifier, responsible for describing the functionality of a Python function. You will be provided with the constraints and relationships between the input parameters, as well as the resulting output of the function based on these inputs. Your task is to organize this information and describe the functionality of the function. Please avoid describing how the function operates or details such as how local variables are initializedâ€”only describe what parameters the function accepts and what it returns. If there are multiple return points in the function we will split them in Cases with an arithmetic counter and remember if one case is fullfilled none of the others are. You must adhere to the text format: Functionality: **functionality**.


Example1:
Parameter constraints and relationships: `number` is an integer.
```
def func(number):
```
Output: `number` is an integer. If `number` is even, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer1:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `number`. `number` is an integer. After executing the function body, if number is even, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `number`, and if `number` is even, it returns True. If `number` is not even, it returns False.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter number, returns `True` if `number` is even. If `number` is not even, it returns `False`.**


Parameter constraints and relationships: `age` is an integer.
```
def func(age):
```
Output: Case_1:`number` is an integer. If `number` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative; 
        Case_2: `number` is an integer. If `number` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult".
Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?


Example Answer:
The function `func` accepts a parameter `age`. `age` is an integer. If `age` is lower than 0, the function returns an error message that ages can't be negative. If `age` is between 0 and 18, the function returns "minor"; otherwise, it returns "adult". Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to accept an integer `age`  and return if the person is a minor or an adult based on the age while handling wrong negative input values.


Your Task:
Parameter constraints: **Precondition**: **n is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each sublist contains 6 integers representing the faces of each cube, and num is a positive integer.**
```
def can_form_number(num):
```
Output: Case_1: Output State: 

If n is 0 or less, the loop does not execute. If n is greater than 0 and a cube with the digit is found during the iteration, the corresponding boolean value in used_cubes is set to True, and found is set to True. The loop breaks as soon as a cube with the digit is found. The final output state includes n, cube_faces, num, digits, used_cubes with values updated based on the loop execution, found indicating if a cube with the digit was found, and i representing the iteration count. If found is True after the loop execution, the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

Output State after the loop executes 1 times: `n` is decremented by 1, corresponding boolean value in `used_cubes` is set to True for the found digit, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1

Output State after the loop executes 2 times: `n` is decremented by 2, corresponding boolean value in `used_cubes` is set to True for the found digit, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `found` is False

Output State after the loop executes 3 times: `n` is decremented by 3, corresponding boolean value in `used_cubes` is set to True for the found digit, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `found` is False

Case_2: `n` is decremented by 3, corresponding boolean value in `used_cubes` is set to True for the found digit, `found` is False, `i` is incremented by 3, and the function returns True

Now, please think step by step: What are the parameters the function accepts, and the return value?
