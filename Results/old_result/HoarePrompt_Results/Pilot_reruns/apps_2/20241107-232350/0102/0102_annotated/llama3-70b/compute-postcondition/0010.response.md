Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and prompts the user to input an integer value 's' where 0 ≤ s ≤ 99. It then prints out the corresponding word representation of 's' based on the input value. If 's' is less than 10, it prints the word from the ones array. If 's' is between 10 and 19, it prints the word from the teens array. If 's' is 20 or greater, it prints the word from the tens array corresponding to the tens place of 's', followed by a hyphen if the ones place of 's' is not zero, and then the word from the ones array corresponding to the ones place of 's'. The function covers all possible edge cases for the input value 's'.**
