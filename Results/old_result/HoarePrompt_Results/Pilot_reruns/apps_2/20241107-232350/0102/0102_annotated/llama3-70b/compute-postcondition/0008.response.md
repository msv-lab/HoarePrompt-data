Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer. If `s` is less than 10, the program prints the value corresponding to `s` in the ones array. If `s` is between 10 and 19, the program prints the value corresponding to `s - 10` in the teens array. If `s` is 20 or greater, the program prints the value from the tens array corresponding to the tens place of `s`, followed by a hyphen if the ones place of `s` is not zero, and then the value from the ones array corresponding to the ones place of `s`. The overall state of the program after the if-else block is determined by the value of `s` and the corresponding actions taken in each branch of the if-else statement, ensuring all possible edge cases are covered.***
