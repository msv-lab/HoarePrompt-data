Example Answer:
The code concatenates the string at index n // 10 from the list `tens` with a hyphen "-" and the string at index n % 10 from the list `ones`. The value of n is used to access the corresponding elements in the `tens` list. Since the initial state does not provide information about the `ones` list, we cannot determine the exact output. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers from 0 to 90.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers from 0 to 90**
