Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to correctly implement the problem description. The function `func_1` takes an integer `n` in the range 0 to 99 and returns the string representation of the corresponding number based on the conditions provided. It correctly handles cases where `n` falls within the specified ranges and returns the corresponding English lowercase representation. The provided examples also match the expected outputs as per the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
