Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is less than 20, the program prints the corresponding value from the `teens` list based on `s`. Otherwise, the program constructs and prints a string using values from the `tens` and `ones` lists. If `s` is a multiple of 10, the string is formed by concatenating the value from `tens` with no additional characters. If `s` is not a multiple of 10, the string is formed by concatenating the value from `tens` with a hyphen and the value from `ones` for the remainder after dividing `s` by 10.***
