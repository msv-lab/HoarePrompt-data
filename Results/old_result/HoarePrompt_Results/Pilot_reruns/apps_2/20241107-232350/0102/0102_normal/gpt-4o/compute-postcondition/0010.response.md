Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing the tens place in numbers from 0 to 90. If 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the function returns the string representation of the number at index `n` in the list `ones`. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the string value at index (n-10) in the list `teens`. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is divisible by 10, the function returns the string at the tens place of the given number. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not divisible by 10, the function concatenates the string at the tens place with the string at the ones place separated by a hyphen. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
