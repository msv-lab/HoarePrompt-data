Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly converts the integer score into its corresponding English lowercase letters representation as required by the problem description. It covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description (0 ≤ s ≤ 99) and provides the correct output for each case. The logic uses predefined lists for ones, teens, and tens to handle different scenarios and concatenates them appropriately to form the final output. The program also includes the necessary conditions to handle edge cases (e.g., when the score is less than 10 or between 10 and 19). Overall, the program aligns with the problem description and produces the expected output for all possible inputs.
