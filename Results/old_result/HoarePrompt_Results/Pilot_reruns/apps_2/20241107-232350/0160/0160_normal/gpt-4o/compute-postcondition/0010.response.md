Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` already contains {1, x // 2, 2}, and now `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, after execution, `divisors` will include {1, x // 2, 2, i}. The value of `x` and other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`x` is a positive integer, `divisors` is a set containing {1, x // 2, 2, i}, `i` is increased by 1**
