The function `func` reads two integer inputs N and K followed by a list of integers A. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A and finds the maximum divisor of the gcd. Finally, it prints the maximum divisor. The function operates within the constraints: 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9, and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all elements in A. However, the specific return value or the main purpose of the function is not explicitly described in the annotations.
