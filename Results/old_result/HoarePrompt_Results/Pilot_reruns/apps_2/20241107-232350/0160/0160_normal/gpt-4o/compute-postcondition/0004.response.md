Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set containing {1, x // i} where `x` is a positive integer and `i` is 1. The set `divisors` is updated with the values 1 and the integer division result of `x` by `i`. This occurs if `x` is divisible by `i`. No changes are made to `divisors` if `x` is not divisible by `i`.***
