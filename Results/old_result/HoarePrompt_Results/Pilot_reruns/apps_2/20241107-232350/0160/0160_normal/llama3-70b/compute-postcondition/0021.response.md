Postcondition: ***`max_divisor` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in `A` and 1. `i` is incremented by 1. `N` and `K` remain unchanged. `gcd` remains 1. `math.sqrt(gcd)` is greater than or equal to 1. If gcd % i == 0, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of the current `max_divisor` and `i`. If i * i is not equal to gcd, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of the current `max_divisor` and the result of gcd divided by `i`.***
