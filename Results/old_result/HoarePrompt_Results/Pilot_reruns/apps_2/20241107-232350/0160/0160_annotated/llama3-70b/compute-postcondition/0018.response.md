Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`, where `max_divisor` is a positive number and `i` is 2. Since `max_divisor` is already assigned the value of `gcd`, and `i` is 2, the new value of `max_divisor` will be the maximum between `gcd` and 2. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_divisor` is the maximum between `gcd` and 2, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is the maximum between `gcd` and 2, `i` is 2**
