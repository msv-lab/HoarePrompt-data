According to the code, the loop can execute as long as N is greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, gcd is assigned the value of the first element of list A, so it is already set. To ensure the loop executes, N should be at least 2, and i should be set to 1.
State: **A is a list of N integers such that 2 <= N <= 500 and 1 <= A_i <= 10^6, K is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, N, K are assigned values from the input split; gcd is assigned the value of the first element of list A, i is 1**
