According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including the divisors found by dividing `x` by the updated value of `i` and adding both the new divisor `i` and the result of `x` divided by the updated value of `i`, where `i` is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- Increment the value of `i` by 1.
- Update `divisors` to include the new divisor found by dividing `x` by the updated value of `i` as well as the result of `x` divided by the updated value of `i`.

State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including the divisors found by dividing `x` by the updated value of `i` and adding both the new divisor `i` and the result of `x` divided by the updated value of `i`, where `i` is incremented by 1.**
