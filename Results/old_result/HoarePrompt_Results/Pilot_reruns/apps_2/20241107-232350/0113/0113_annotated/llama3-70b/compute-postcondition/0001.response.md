Example Answer: 
The value of x is calculated as 10 to the power of k, where k can be any value from 0 to 8. Therefore, the value of x can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. Since k can be any value from 0 to 8, x can take any of these values. Therefore, the Output State is: x is a positive integer calculated as 10 to the power of k.
Output State: **x is a positive integer calculated as 10 to the power of k**
