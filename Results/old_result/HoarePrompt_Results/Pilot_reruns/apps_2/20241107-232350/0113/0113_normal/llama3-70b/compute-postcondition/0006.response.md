Example Answer:
`n` is increased by 1, so if the initial state of `n` was a positive integer, it will be further increased by 1. The value of `k` remains unaffected. The value of `x` is not given, but it is mentioned that it is the next higher value from the given options that is greater than the current value of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer increased by 7, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is the next higher value from the given options that is greater than the current value of `x`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer increased by 7, `k` is a non-negative integer, and `x` is the next higher value from the given options that is greater than the current value of `x`**
