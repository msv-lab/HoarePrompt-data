The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns a string indicating the day of the week based on the value of `k`:
- If `k` is 0, the function returns "Sunday".
- If `k` is 1, the function returns "Monday".
- If `k` is 2, the function returns "Tuesday".
- If `k` is 3, the function returns "Wednesday".
- If `k` is 4, the function returns "Thursday".
- If `k` is 5, the function returns "Friday".
- If `k` is 6, the function returns "Saturday".
- If `k` is greater than 6, the function calculates the day of the week based on `k` modulo 7 and returns the corresponding day.
Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to return the day of the week based on the value of `k`.
