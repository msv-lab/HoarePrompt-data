Example Answer: 
An empty list `buses` is initialized. The values of `n` and `t` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is an empty list**
