Postcondition: ***`n`, `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`. The variables `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. The calculation of `wait_time` depends on the conditions mentioned in the precondition, where if `s_i >= t`, `wait_time` is `s_i - t`, if `(t - s_i) % d_i` is 0, `wait_time` is 0, and otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the program fragment and ensures that the state of the variables is correctly updated after the execution of the if statement.***
