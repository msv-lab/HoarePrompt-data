According to the code provided, for the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` needs to be incremented by 1, `s_i` and `d_i` need to be assigned the values from the next tuple in the `bus_routes` list, and `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` need to be updated based on the conditions specified in the program fragment.

State: **`n`, `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `i` is one more than its previous value, `s_i` is assigned the value of the source from the bus_routes at index `i`, `d_i` is assigned the value of the destination from the bus_routes at index `i`, `wait_time`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route` are updated based on the conditions specified in the program fragment**
