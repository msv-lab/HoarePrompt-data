Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program correctly reads the input values for `n`, `t`, and the bus routes.
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the wait time for each bus route based on the given conditions.
- It then determines the chosen route based on the minimum wait time.
- The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output.
- The output hints also align with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
