Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `min_time` is updated to the minimum value between its previous value and the current `time`, and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`, where `i` is the index of the tuple in `buses` that resulted in the minimum time. If there are multiple tuples with the same minimum time, `ans` will be assigned to the index of the first occurrence. The initial state of the variables remains the same as described in the precondition.***
