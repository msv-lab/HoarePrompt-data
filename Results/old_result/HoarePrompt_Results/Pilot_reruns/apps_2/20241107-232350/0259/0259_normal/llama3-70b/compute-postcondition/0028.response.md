Example Answer:
`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The calculation of `time` is based on `(t - s) % d`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_time` has been updated, `ans` has been updated, the rest of the variables remain unchanged, and the calculation of `time` is based on `(t - s) % d`.
Output State: **`min_time` has been updated, `ans` has been updated, the rest of the variables remain unchanged, and the calculation of `time` is based on `(t - s) % d`**
