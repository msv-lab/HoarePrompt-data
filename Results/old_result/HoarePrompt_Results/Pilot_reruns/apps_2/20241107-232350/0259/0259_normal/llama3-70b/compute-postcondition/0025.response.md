At the end of the last iteration, `min_time` has been updated to a new value based on the comparison between its previous value and the current `time`, and `ans` has been updated to `i + 1` where `i` is the index of the tuple in `buses` that resulted in the minimum time. The initial state of the variables is as follows: `min_time` and `ans` have been updated, and the rest of the variables remain the same.

State: **`min_time` has been updated, `ans` has been updated, the rest of the variables remain unchanged**
