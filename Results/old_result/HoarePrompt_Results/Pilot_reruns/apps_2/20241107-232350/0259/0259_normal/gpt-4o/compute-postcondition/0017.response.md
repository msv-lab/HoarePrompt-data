Postcondition: ***`n`, `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `i` is one more than its previous value, `s_i` is assigned the value of the source from the bus_routes at index `i`, `d_i` is assigned the value of the destination from the bus_routes at index `i`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
