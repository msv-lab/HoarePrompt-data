Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly implements the problem description by iterating through each bus route, calculating the time until the next bus arrival, and keeping track of the minimum time. The program then outputs the bus route that has the minimum time until the next bus arrival, which aligns with the requirements of the problem. The logic of the program seems sound and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
