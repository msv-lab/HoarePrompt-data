Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the problem description by iterating through each bus route and calculating the wait time for Serval for each route. It then chooses the route with the minimum wait time, which is the correct approach as described in the problem. The logic for calculating the wait time is also correct based on the conditions given in the problem description. The program handles all the potential cases mentioned in the problem statement and provides the correct output.
