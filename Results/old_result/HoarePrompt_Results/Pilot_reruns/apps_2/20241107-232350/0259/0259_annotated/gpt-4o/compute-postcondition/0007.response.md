Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This condition covers all possible scenarios for the program variables after the execution of the if else block.***
