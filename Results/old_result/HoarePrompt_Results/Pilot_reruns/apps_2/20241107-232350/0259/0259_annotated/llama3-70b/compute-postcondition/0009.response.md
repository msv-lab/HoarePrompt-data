Example Answer:
`s, d` are assigned the values from `input().split()`, where `input().split()` accepts an input and splits it into two integers. The values of `s` and `d` are dependent on the input provided. The list `buses` contains the previous tuples along with the newly appended tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains the previous tuples along with the newly appended tuple.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `t` is an input integer, `buses` contains the previous tuples along with the newly appended tuple**
