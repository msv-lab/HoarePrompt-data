Example Answer:
The `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Since `min_wait_time` is positive infinity and `chosen_route` is -1, they are not affected by this calculation. The value of `wait_time` is determined by the values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`, `wait_time` is calculated based on `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`, `wait_time` is calculated based on `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`**
