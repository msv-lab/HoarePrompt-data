According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. If n is greater than 0, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, min_wait_time is positive infinity and chosen_route is -1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 0 and `i` needs to start at 0.
State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
