According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `n`. If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute. Since `buses` is an empty list, it does not affect the loop execution. At the start of the loop, `t` is not relevant to the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, `n` needs to be greater than 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an input integer, `buses` is an empty list**
