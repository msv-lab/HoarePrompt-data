Example Answer:
`dist4` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos`. The values of `n` and `min_pos` are known, where `n` is between 2 and 100, and `min_pos` is 0. Therefore, the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `min_pos` is `n - 1`. Hence, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`, `dist3` is 0, `dist4` is equal to `n - 1`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`, `dist3` is 0, `dist4` is equal to `n - 1`**
