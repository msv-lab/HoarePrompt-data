Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and `n` in the list, and the minimum distance between those positions. Finally, it prints the maximum value between the maximum distance and `n - 1 - min_dist`. The function does not return any value.**
