Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the element 1 in list `a` and assigns it to variable `pos1`. Since the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, and `1` is present in `a`, the index of `1` in `a` will be the same as the value of `1`. Therefore, `pos1` will be assigned the value `1`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 1**
