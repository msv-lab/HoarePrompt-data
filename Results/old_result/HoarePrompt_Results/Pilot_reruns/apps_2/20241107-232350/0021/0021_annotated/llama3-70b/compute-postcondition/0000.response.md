Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `n` is constrained to be between 2 and 100, the input array `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. The input array `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`.**
