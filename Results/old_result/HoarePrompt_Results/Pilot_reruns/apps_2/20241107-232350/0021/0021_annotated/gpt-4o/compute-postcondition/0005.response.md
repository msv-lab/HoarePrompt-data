Example Answer:
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. Therefore, the value of `dist2` will be the absolute difference between `n - 1` and the index of `n` in list `a`. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is the index of `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`**
