Example Answer:
The variable `posn` is assigned the index of `n` in the list `a` using the `index()` method. The value of `n` is the maximum integer in the list `a`, so `posn` will be the index of the maximum integer in the list. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers, the index of `n` will be unique. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, pos1 is the index of 1 in the list a, posn is the index of the maximum integer in the list a.
Output State: **n is an input integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n, pos1 is the index of 1 in the list a, posn is the index of the maximum integer in the list a**
