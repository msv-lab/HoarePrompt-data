Example Answer:
`dist1` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`, where `max_pos` is `n-1`. Since `n` is between 2 and 100, `max_pos` will be between 1 and 99. Therefore, `dist1` will be the absolute difference between 0 and a number between 1 and 99. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100; the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is 0; `max_pos` is `n-1`; `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and a number between 1 and 99**
