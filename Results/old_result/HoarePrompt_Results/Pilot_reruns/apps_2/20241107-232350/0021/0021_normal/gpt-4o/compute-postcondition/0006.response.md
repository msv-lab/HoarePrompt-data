Example Answer:
`dist3` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, where `min_pos` is currently 0. Since the absolute difference between 0 and 0 is 0, `dist3` is 0. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= `n` <= 100; the list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`; `min_pos` is 0; `max_pos` is `n-1`; `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and a number between 1 and 99; `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and a number between 1 and 99; `dist3` is 0**
