Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `total_fruits`. The value of `total_fruits` is not explicitly given in the code snippet, so it depends on the initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. Since the initial state specifies that `total_fruits` is calculated based on the input values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, the output state should reflect the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` as input integers and the calculated `total_fruits`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, and the calculated `total_fruits` based on the input values**
