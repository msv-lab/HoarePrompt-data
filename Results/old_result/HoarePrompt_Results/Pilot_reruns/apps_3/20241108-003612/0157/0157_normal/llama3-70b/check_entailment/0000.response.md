Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates the minimum number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use based on the ratio provided in the recipe. Then, it calculates the maximum total number of fruits Nikolay can use to cook the compote by multiplying the minimum value with 1, 2, and 4 for lemons, apples, and pears respectively. The output is the sum of these values. 

The output hints also agree with the code. The function does exactly what it is supposed to do according to the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
