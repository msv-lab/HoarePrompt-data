According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 0, `k` is 1, and the `dp` dictionary has been updated with the value for key (n, k). Since `k` is 1, the loop will not execute again. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is 0, `k` is 1, `dp` dictionary now stores the updated value for key (n, k)**
