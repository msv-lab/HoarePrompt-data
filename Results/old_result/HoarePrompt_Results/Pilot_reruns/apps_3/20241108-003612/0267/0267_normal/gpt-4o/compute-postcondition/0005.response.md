Example Answer: 
`total_sum` is updated to be the remainder of the sum of `total_sum` and `num` divided by `MOD`. The value of `num` is `l + 1`, and the values of `l` and `r` are constrained as specified. Therefore, the new value of `total_sum` will depend on the previous value of `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `MOD`. 
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated based on the previous values of `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `MOD**.
