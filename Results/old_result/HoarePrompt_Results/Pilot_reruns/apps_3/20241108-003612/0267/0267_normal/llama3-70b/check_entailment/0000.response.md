Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The function `func_1` correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits by subtracting the count of numbers less than `l` from the count of numbers less than or equal to `r`. This calculation is done using the `count` function.
- The `count` function correctly handles different cases based on the input values of `n` and `k`, as described in the output description.
- The calculations in the `count` function seem to be correct and aligned with the problem description.
- The code does not seem to miss out on any edge cases or potential scenarios that are not covered in the problem description.

Therefore, based on the analysis and given examples, the code appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
