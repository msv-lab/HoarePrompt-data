The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` is an integer and `k` is an integer within the range 1 <= k <= 10. The function then converts `n` to a string, creates a set of its digits, and checks if the number of unique digits is less than or equal to `k`. The function returns True if the condition is met, indicating that the number of unique digits in `n` is within the limit set by `k`.
