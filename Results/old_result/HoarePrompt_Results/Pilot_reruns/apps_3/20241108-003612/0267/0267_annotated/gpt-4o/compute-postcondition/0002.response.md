Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding the value of `num` to it and then taking the modulus `MOD` of the sum. The previous values of `total_sum` and `num` are 0 and `l` respectively. Therefore, the new value of `total_sum` is `(0 + l) % MOD` and `num` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated to the result of `(0 + l) % MOD`, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
