According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range from `l` to `r` is non-empty, meaning `l` is less than or equal to `r`. Before the loop starts, `total_sum` is 0. So, for the loop to execute, the range specified by `l` and `r` must be non-empty, and `num` should start at the value of `l`.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `num` is equal to `l`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`**
