Example Answer:
`dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the calculated value to it. The calculation involves `i`, which is 2, and `k`, which is given as greater than 1. The value of `dp[n, k]` is modified based on the formula provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `dp` is updated with a new value, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 1, `dp` is updated with a new value, `i` is 2**
