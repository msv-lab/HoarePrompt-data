Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `count` to calculate the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits in a given range. The function uses dynamic programming to efficiently calculate this count. The main function `func_1` then calculates the sum of numbers in the range `[l, r]` with at most `k` different digits by subtracting the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits in the range `[1, l-1]` from the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits in the range `[1, r]`.

The implementation correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases. The logic for counting numbers with at most `k` different digits is sound and accounts for various scenarios such as numbers with leading zeros and single-digit numbers. Since the program handles the range `[1, 10^18]` and maximum of `10` different digits, it covers all possible inputs within the given constraints.
