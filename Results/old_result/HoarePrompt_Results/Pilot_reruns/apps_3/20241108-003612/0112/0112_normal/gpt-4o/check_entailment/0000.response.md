Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The `func_1` function correctly iterates through numbers starting from 1 until `can_form_number` returns false, and then returns the last number before the condition is not met. 
- The `can_form_number` function correctly checks if each digit can be formed using the available cube faces. 
- The code aligns with the problem description for all potential cases and the examples provided. 
- The output hints also agree with the code and provide additional clarity on the functionality of the functions. 
- There are no edge cases identified that the code does not handle as per the problem description.
