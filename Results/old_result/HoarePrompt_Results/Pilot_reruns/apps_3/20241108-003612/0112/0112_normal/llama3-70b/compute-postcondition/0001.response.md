Example Answer:
A list `cubes` is created by taking `n` lists of integers as input and splitting them. Since `n` is an input integer, the number of lists and their content will depend on the input provided. Therefore, the output state will be `n` is an input integer, and `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on the input provided.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers based on the input provided**
