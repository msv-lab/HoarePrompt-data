Postcondition: ***If cubes is a list with at least 1 cube, digits is a set containing string representations of digits from all cubes except '0', and cube is the last cube in the list. If cubes is an empty list, digits remains an empty set and cube is not defined. The program removes '0' from digits if it exists in the set. In all cases, the program ensures that the state of the variables cubes, digits, and cube is appropriately maintained after the execution of the if statement.***
