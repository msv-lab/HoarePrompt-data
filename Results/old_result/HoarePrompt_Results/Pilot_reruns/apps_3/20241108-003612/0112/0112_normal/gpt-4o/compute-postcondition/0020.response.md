Output State: **If `digits` is empty, the loop won't execute, and all variables remain unchanged. If `digits` is not empty, the loop iterates through the elements of `used_cubes` and checks if the cube has not been used and if the digit is in the cube faces. If a match is found, the corresponding `used_cubes` element is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop breaks. The final state will have `used_cubes` updated accordingly, `found` set to True if a match was found, and `i` equal to the number of iterations that occurred.**
