According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i-th` element is set to `True` if not already used and `found` is True if a match is found, `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be set to 1.
2. The condition `i < n` needs to be satisfied, so `n` should be greater than or equal to 2 (since `i` is 0 at the end of the last iteration).
3. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list containing at least one digit, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the `i-th` element is set to `True` if not already used, `found` is True if a match is found, `i` is 1**
