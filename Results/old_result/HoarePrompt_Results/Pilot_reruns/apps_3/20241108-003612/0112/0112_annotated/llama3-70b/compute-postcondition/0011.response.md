Example Answer:
The element '0' is removed from the list `digits`. If '0' was present in `digits`, it is now removed. If '0' was not present, the list remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: digits will contain the unique string representation of all digits in the cubes excluding '0'.
Output State: **digits will contain the unique string representation of all digits in the cubes excluding '0'**
