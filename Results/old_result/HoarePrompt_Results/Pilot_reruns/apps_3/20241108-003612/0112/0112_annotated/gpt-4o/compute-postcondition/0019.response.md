According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. No other specific conditions are mentioned for the loop to execute again, so the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i`. It should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the ith element is set to True if it was not used before and the digit is in the corresponding cube face list, `found` is True if an unused cube with the digit is found, otherwise False, `i` is incremented by 1**
