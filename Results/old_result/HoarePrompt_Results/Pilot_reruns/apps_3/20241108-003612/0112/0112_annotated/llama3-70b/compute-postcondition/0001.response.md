Example Answer:
`cubes` is assigned a list of lists where each inner list contains integers obtained from splitting the input. The number of inner lists is equal to the value of `n`, which represents the number of cubes. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; cubes is a list containing the input values split into integers.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; cubes is a list containing the input values split into integers**
