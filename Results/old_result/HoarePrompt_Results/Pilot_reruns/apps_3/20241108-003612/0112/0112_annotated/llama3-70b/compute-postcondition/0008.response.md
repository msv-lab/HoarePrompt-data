Example Answer:
The code iterates through each digit in the third cube and updates the `digits` list with the string representation of each digit. Since `cube` is the third cube in the list, `digits` will be updated with the string representation of digits in the third cube. The previous values of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, cube is the third cube in the list, digits is updated with the string representation of digits in the third cube.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, cube is the third cube in the list, digits is updated with the string representation of digits in the third cube**
