Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans where the ith element is set to True if it was not used before and the digit is in the corresponding cube face list, `found` is True if an unused cube with the digit is found, otherwise False. The if statement checks if the digit is in the ith cube face and the ith cube is not used before, then it sets the ith element of `used_cubes` to True and `found` to True, then breaks the loop. This ensures that after the if statement execution, `found` is True if an unused cube with the digit is found, and the corresponding cube is marked as used in `used_cubes`***
