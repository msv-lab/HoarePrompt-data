Example Answer:
The string representation of all digits in the cubes excluding '0' is sorted in descending order and then joined to form an integer. If '0' was present in digits, it has been removed before sorting and joining. 
Output State: **max_num is the integer formed by sorting digits in descending order after removing '0'.**
