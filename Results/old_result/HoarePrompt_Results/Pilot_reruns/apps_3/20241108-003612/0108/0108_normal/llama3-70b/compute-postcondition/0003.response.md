According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `alphabet` string. Since the loop iterates over each character in `alphabet`, the loop is guaranteed to execute.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of only lowercase English letters, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is an empty string, `char` is the first character in the `alphabet` string**
