Postcondition: ***If the length of res is 26, the program prints res. Otherwise, the program prints -1. In the case where 'a' is in the initial string s, after the loop finishes, s does not contain 'a' but contains the next character in the alphabet, and res contains all occurrences of 'a' replaced with subsequent characters until 'a' is no longer in s. If 'a' is not in the initial string s, res is an empty string, and char is the next character in the alphabet. The loop will continue until the last character in the alphabet is processed. When 'a' is not in s, char is not in s after the loop finishes.***
