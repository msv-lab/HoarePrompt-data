Example Answer:
The value of `char` is added to the `res` string. Since `char` is already in `s`, it gets concatenated to `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is the updated string after replacing the first occurrence of 'a' with 'b', `char` is in `s`, `res` is the updated string after concatenating `char`.
Output State: **`s` is the updated string after replacing the first occurrence of 'a' with 'b', `char` is in `s`, `res` is the updated string after concatenating `char`**
