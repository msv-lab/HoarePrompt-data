Output State: **If 'a' is in `s`, `s` does not contain 'a' but contains 'b', `res` contains all occurrences of 'a' replaced with the next character until 'a' is no longer in `s`. If 'a' is not in `s`, `res` is an empty string, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the current `char`. The loop will execute until 'a' is no longer in `s`, and `char` will be the next character in the alphabet after the last replacement of 'a' with the subsequent character in `s`.**
