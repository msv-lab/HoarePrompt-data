Example Answer:
`res` is concatenated with `char`, which is 'a'. If 's' contains 'a', the number of occurrences of 'a' will be the same as the length of `res`. 's' will have all 'a's replaced by 'b', and `char` will remain 'a'. 
Output State: **If 's' contains 'a', `res` will be a string of 'a's with the same length as the number of occurrences of 'a' in 's', 's' will have all occurrences of 'a' replaced by 'b', and `char` will remain 'a'**
