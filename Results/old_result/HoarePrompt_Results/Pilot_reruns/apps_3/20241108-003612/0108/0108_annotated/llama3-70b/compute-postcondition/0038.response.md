Example Answer:
If 's' contains 'a', the number of occurrences of 'a' in `s` will determine the value of `res` which will be a string of 'b's with the same length as the number of occurrences of 'a' in `s`. All occurrences of 'a' in `s` will be replaced by 'b', and `char` will remain 'a'. If 'a' is not in `s`, the loop will not execute, and `res` will not be printed. 
Output State: **Depends on the input string 's' and the number of occurrences of 'a' in it.**
