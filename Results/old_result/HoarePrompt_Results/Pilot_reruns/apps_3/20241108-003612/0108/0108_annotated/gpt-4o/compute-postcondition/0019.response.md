Postcondition: ***Given the conditions mentioned, after the execution of the if-else block, the program will either print the string 'target' if s contains all characters of target in order or print -1. The values of i and j are determined based on whether s contains all characters of target in order or not, as well as the lengths of s and target. In cases where s or target is empty, i and j are set to 0. If s is longer than target or does not contain all characters of target, j is less than 26.***
