Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of 'a' in 's' with the character that comes after 'a' in the ASCII table. The length of 'res' will be the same as the number of occurrences of 'a' in the original 's'. The character 'char' remains 'a', and 's' has all occurrences of 'a' replaced by 'b'. 
Output State: **`s` will have all occurrences of 'a' replaced by 'b', `res` will be a string of 'a's with the same length as the number of occurrences of 'a' in `s`, `char` remains 'a'**
