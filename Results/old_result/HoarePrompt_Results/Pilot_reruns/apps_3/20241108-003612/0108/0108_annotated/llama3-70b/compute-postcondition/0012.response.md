According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is 'bb', `res` is 'aaa', `char` is 'a'. Since `char` is 'a' and it is in `s`, the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is 'bb', `res` is 'aaa', `char` is 'a'**
