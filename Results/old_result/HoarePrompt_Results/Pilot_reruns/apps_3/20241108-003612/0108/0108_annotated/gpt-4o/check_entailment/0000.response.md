Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code follows the problem description accurately. It takes a string `s` as input, iterates through it to check if it contains the characters of the target string "abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz" in order, and prints either the target string or -1 based on the result. The annotations also align with the code logic and provide insights into the state of the variables at different points in the program execution. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description are covered by the code, ensuring that it meets the requirements for all potential cases.
