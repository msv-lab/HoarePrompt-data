Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly checks if Vasya's favorite number b appears in the sequence based on the input values of a, b, and c. 
1. If b is equal to a, then the program prints 'YES', which is correct as b is the first element in the sequence.
2. If c is 0, then the program prints 'NO', which is correct as the sequence will not change from the first element a.
3. If (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative, then the program prints 'YES', which is correct as b can be reached in the sequence by adding multiples of c to a.
4. Otherwise, the program prints 'NO', which is correct as b cannot be reached in the sequence based on the given conditions. 

The program covers all possible cases based on the problem description, and for every input provided in the examples, it gives the correct output.
