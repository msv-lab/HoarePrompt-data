Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. If `a` is equal to `b`, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed. This code handles the case where `a` is equal to `b` and where `a` is not equal to `b`, ensuring that the output corresponds correctly to the comparison result between `a` and `b`.***
