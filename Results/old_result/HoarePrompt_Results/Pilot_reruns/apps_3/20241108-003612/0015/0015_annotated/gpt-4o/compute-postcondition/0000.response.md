Example Answer: 
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the integer values obtained by splitting the input. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now determined by the input provided, but their specific values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers based on the input**
