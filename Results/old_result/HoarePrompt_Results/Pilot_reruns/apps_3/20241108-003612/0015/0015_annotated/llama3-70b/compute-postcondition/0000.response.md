Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string into integers. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are now determined by the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers**
