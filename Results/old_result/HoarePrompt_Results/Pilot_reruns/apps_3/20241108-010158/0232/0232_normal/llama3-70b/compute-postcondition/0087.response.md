Output State: **`found` is True, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` as the key and the value incremented by 1, `color` is the new color value, `i` is the starting index, `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1. If the color is not present in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
