Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program takes input values for `n`, `m`, a list of `n` colors, and a list of `m` counts. 
- It then checks if there exists a contiguous interval of Jedi Knights such that there are exactly `k_1` knights with lightsabers of the first color, `k_2` knights with lightsabers of the second color, and so on.
- The code iterates through all possible windows of Jedi Knights and checks if the count of each color in that window matches the desired counts specified in the input.
- If such a window is found, it sets `found` to True and breaks out of the loop. Then it prints 'YES', otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
- The program correctly follows the problem description and outputs the correct result for all potential cases.
