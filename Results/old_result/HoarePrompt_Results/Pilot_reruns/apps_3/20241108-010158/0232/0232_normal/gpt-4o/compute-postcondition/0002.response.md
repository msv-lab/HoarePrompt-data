Example Answer:
`left` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers of subsequent Jedi Knights, `k` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, `current_counts` is an empty defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers of subsequent Jedi Knights, `k` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, `current_counts` is an empty defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0**
