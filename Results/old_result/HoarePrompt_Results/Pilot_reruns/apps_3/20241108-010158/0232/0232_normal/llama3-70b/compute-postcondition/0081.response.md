According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1`. So, the initial state needs to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1`. Additionally, since the loop starts at `i`, the state should also be adjusted so that `i` is the starting index. Since `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, it does not affect the loop execution. The state should ensure that `color` is the last color in the list and `found` is False.
State: **`found` is False, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `color` is the last color in the list, `i` is the starting index, `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1**
