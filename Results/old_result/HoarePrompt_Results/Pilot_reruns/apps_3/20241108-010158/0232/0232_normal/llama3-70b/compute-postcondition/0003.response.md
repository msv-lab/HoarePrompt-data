Example Answer:
The dictionary `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of n Jedi Knights, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of n Jedi Knights, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**
