Example Answer:
The variable `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, where `j` is the current index. The value of `j` is unknown, but it is assumed to be within the range of the list. The value of `color` is now updated to the color at index `j` in the list `colors`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of n Jedi Knights, `color` is the color at index `j` in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `color_counts` is a dictionary with each color as a key and the number of occurrences of that color as the value, `found` is False, n is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of n integers representing the colors of the lightsabers of n Jedi Knights, `color` is the color at index `j` in the list, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `color_counts` is a dictionary with each color as a key and the number of occurrences of that color as the value, `found` is False, n is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
