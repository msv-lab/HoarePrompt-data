Postcondition: ***`colors` is a list of n integers with at least 1 element, `k` is a list of m integers, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with updated counts, `left` is 0, `right` is 1. If all colors in `desired_counts` have their counts matching the counts in `current_counts`, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
