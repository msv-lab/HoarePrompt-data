Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where the value associated with the key `color` is either incremented by 1 if `color` was already a key, or `color` is added to `window_counts` with a value of 1. `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i + 1`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j+1]`. If all values in the sorted `window_counts` dictionary are equal to the corresponding values in the `counts` list, then `found` is set to True after the execution of the if block. The break statement is triggered, exiting the loop.***
