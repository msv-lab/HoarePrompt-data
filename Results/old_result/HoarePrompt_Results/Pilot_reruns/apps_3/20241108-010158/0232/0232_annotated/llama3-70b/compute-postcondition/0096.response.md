Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary with updated count for the key `color`, `found` is True, `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is set to the new value of `i`, and `color` is the value of `colors[j]`. The loop is exited if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`.***
