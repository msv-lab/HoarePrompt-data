Postcondition: ***`n`, `m` are integers representing the number of Jedi Knights and possible lightsaber colors respectively. `colors` is a list of at least `n+2` integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight. `counts` is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color. `color` is an integer representing a specific lightsaber color. If the `color` is not in `color_counts` dictionary, the count of the specified `color` in the `color_counts` dictionary is updated to 0.***
