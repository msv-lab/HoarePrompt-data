Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `window_counts` is a dictionary with keys representing colors and values of 1 if the color was not present in `window_counts` before, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value of 1. After the execution of the code snippet, if all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding targets, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. The postcondition covers all edge cases including the scenario where the loop does not break due to the condition not being met, ensuring the integrity of the program variables.***
