Postcondition: ***For each color in desired_counts, if the count of that color in current_counts is equal to the desired count, the function returns 'YES'. The increment of current_counts at index colors[right] by 1 is reflected in the postcondition as well. If all colors have their desired counts, the program returns 'YES'. This postcondition covers the scenario where the function returns 'YES' after incrementing current_counts at colors[right] by 1 and when all color counts match the desired counts.***
