Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `window_counts` is a dictionary with keys representing colors and values of 1 if the color was not present in `window_counts` before, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If all the values in `window_counts` after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. This holds true for all combinations and edge cases of the initial variables `found`, `n`, `i`, `j`, `window_counts`, and `color`.***
