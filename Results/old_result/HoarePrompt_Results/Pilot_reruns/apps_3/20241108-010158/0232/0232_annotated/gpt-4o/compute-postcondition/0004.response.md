Example Answer:
The value of `current_counts` at index `colors[right]` is increased by 1. The previous state of `current_counts` is not given, so after execution, the `current_counts` at index `colors[right]` is incremented by 1. No other variables are affected. 
Output State: **`current_counts` at index `colors[right]` is incremented by 1**
