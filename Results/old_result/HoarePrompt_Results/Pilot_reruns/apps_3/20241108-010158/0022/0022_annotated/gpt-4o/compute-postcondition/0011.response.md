Output State: **If the length of string `s` is at least 2, the loop iterates through the first half of the string comparing characters at symmetric positions. If a pair of characters at indices `i` and `n - 1 - i` are not equal, the function returns False. If the length of the string is less than 2, the loop does not execute.**
