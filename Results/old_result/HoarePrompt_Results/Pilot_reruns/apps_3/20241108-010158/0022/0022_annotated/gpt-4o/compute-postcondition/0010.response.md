According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s`, and `i` is less than `n // 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`. 
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s`, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1`**
