Example Answer:
The loop iterates through the characters of the input string `s` comparing characters at symmetric positions. If a mismatch is found, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop terminates. If the loop completes without finding a mismatch, `is_spalindrome` remains True. The output is then printed based on the value of `is_spalindrome`.
Output State: **`s` is the input string provided, `n` is the length of `s` and at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is either True or False based on the comparison of characters, `i` is the index of the characters being compared in each iteration of the loop.**
