According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length at least 2 and at most 1000, `n` is the length of string s, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **s is a string of length at least 2 and at most 1000, n is the length of string s, i is 2**
