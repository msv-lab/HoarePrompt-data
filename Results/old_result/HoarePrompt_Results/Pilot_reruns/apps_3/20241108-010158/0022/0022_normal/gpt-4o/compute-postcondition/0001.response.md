According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than or equal to 2. Since n is the length of string s, it implies that the string s must have a length of at least 2 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, s is a string of length between 1 and 1000, so for the loop to execute, the string s must have a length of at least 2, and i is 0.
State: **s is a string of length at least 2 and at most 1000, n is the length of string s, i is 0**
