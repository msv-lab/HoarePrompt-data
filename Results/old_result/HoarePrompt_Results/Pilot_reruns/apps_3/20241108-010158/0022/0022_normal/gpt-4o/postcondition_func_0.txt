The function func_1 accepts a string parameter `s` of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters. It then checks if the input string `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters at corresponding positions from the start and end of the string. If any pair of characters do not match, the function returns False. If the length of the string is less than 2, the function does not execute the loop and also returns False.
