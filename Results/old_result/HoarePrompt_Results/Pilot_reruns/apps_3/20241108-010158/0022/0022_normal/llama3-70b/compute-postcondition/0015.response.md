According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. If the characters at symmetrical positions within the string `s` do not match, `is_palindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is less than `n // 2`. If the loop is to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be equal to `n // 2` - 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is equal to `n // 2 - 1`**
