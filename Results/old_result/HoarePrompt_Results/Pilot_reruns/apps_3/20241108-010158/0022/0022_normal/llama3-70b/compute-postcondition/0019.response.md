Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string `s` consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive. It then checks if the string `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end of the string. If `s` is a palindrome, it prints 'TAK'; otherwise, it prints 'NIE'. The function does not explicitly return a value.**
