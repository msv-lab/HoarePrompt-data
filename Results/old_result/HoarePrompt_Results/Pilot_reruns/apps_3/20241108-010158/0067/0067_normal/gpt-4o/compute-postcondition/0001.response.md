Example Answer:
`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, which can be any integer between 0 and 100 based on the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 100 based on the input; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers between 0 and 100 based on the input; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`**
