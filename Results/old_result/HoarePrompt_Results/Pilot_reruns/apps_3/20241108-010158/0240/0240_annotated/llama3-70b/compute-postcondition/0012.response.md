Output State: **`s` is a string representing a very large integer with at least one character, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing characters of `t`, `c` is the next character in `s`, `n` is a string containing the concatenation of characters that are in `t_set`. If no characters in `s` are in `t_set`, `n` is an empty string.** 

If `t` is an empty string, then `t_set` will be an empty set and the loop will not execute, leaving `n` as an empty string.
