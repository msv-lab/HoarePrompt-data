You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya decided to pass a very large integer n to Kate. First, he wrote that number as a string, then he appended to the right integer k — the number of digits in n. 

Magically, all the numbers were shuffled in arbitrary order while this note was passed to Kate. The only thing that Vasya remembers, is a non-empty substring of n (a substring of n is a sequence of consecutive digits of the number n).

Vasya knows that there may be more than one way to restore the number n. Your task is to find the smallest possible initial integer n. Note that decimal representation of number n contained no leading zeroes, except the case the integer n was equal to zero itself (in this case a single digit 0 was used).


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains the string received by Kate. The number of digits in this string does not exceed 1 000 000.

The second line contains the substring of n which Vasya remembers. This string can contain leading zeroes. 

It is guaranteed that the input data is correct, and the answer always exists.


-----Output-----

Print the smalles integer n which Vasya could pass to Kate.

Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(s, sub):
    n_len = len(s) - len(sub)
    #State of the program here: `s` and `sub` are strings, `n_len` is the result of the calculation
    s_counter = Counter(s)
    #State of the program here: `s` and `sub` are strings, `n_len` is the result of the calculation, `s_counter` contains the counts of characters in string `s`
    sub_counter = Counter(sub)
    #State of the program here: `s` and `sub` are strings, `n_len` is the result of the calculation, `s_counter` contains the counts of characters in string `s`, `sub_counter` contains the counts of characters in string `sub`
    for char in sub_counter:
        s_counter[char] -= sub_counter[char]
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, the characters in `sub_counter` are subtracted from the corresponding characters in `s_counter`. If `sub_counter` still has characters left after the loop executes, it means there are characters in `sub` that are not present in `s`. If `sub_counter` is empty before the loop starts, then the loop does not execute and there is no change in the variables.
    remaining_chars = ''.join([(char * s_counter[char]) for char in s_counter])
    #State of the program here: remaining_chars contains characters repeated based on s_counter
    possible_numbers = generate_possible_numbers(remaining_chars, sub)
    #State of the program here: remaining_chars contains characters repeated based on s_counter, possible_numbers is generated based on remaining_chars and sub
    smallest_number = min(possible_numbers, key=int)
    #State of the program here: remaining_chars contains characters repeated based on s_counter, possible_numbers is generated based on remaining_chars and sub, smallest_number is the smallest number from the possible_numbers list
    return smallest_number
    #State of the program after the return statement: `remaining_chars` contains characters repeated based on `s_counter`, `possible_numbers` is generated based on `remaining_chars` and `sub`, `smallest_number` is the smallest number from the `possible_numbers` list
#Overall this is what the function does: The function accepts two string parameters `s` and `sub`, generates `remaining_chars` based on `s_counter`, creates `possible_numbers` from `remaining_chars` and `sub`, and returns the smallest number from the `possible_numbers` list.


#Function 2:
def is_valid_number(num_str, sub):
    return sub in num_str and len(num_str) == n_len
    #State of the program after the return statement: `num_str` is a string representing a very large integer, `sub` is a substring of `num_str`, and `n_len` is the number of digits in `num_str`
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `is_valid_number` accepts two parameters: `num_str`, which is a string representing a very large integer, and `sub`, which is a substring of `num_str`. The function also accepts `n_len`, which is the number of digits in `num_str`. The function does not return any specific value, but it verifies if the substring `sub` is present in the very large integer `num_str`.


#Function 3:
def generate_possible_numbers(chars, sub):
    for perm in permutations(chars):
        candidate = ''.join(perm)
        
        if is_valid_number(candidate, sub):
            yield candidate
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: `chars` is a non-empty string representing a sequence of digits, `sub` is a string representing a substring of n. The loop generates permutations of `chars` and joins them to create `candidate`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns True, then the loop yields `candidate`. Otherwise, no action is taken. If `chars` is an empty string or `sub` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and no action is taken.
#Overall this is what the function does: The function `generate_possible_numbers` accepts two parameters: `chars` and `sub`. `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits, and `sub` is a string representing a substring of n. The function does not return a specific value or have a specific functionality defined in the prompt.





I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
