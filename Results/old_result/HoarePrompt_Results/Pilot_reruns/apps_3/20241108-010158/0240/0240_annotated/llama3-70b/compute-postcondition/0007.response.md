Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing a very large integer with at least one character, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing characters of `t`, `c` is the next character in `s`. If `c` is in `t_set`, `n` is updated by concatenating `c` to the previous value of `n`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, `n` remains the same.***
