The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` and `t`. `s` is a string representing a very large integer with at least one character, and `t` is a substring of `s`. The function also uses `t_set`, which is a set containing characters of `t`, `c`, which is the next character in `s`, and `n`, which is a string containing the concatenation of characters that are in `t_set` concatenated with `t`. If no characters in `s` are in `t_set`, `n` is an empty string. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two string parameters `s` and `t`, and based on the relationship between these strings, it generates a new string `n`. If no characters in `s` are found in `t`, it returns an empty string.
