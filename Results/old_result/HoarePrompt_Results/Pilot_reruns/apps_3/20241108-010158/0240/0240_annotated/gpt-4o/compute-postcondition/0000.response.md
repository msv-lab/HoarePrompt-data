According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the `chars` string is not empty. The `permutations` function generates permutations of the characters in the `chars` string. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `chars` string must have at least 1 character. 

State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing a sequence of digits, `sub` is a string representing a substring of n**
