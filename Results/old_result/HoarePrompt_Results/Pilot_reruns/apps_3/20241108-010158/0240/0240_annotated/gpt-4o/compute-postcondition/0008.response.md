According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the permutations available in `chars`. If `chars` has more permutations available, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` has more permutations available, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is the joined string of `perm`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `chars` needs to have even more permutations available.
State: **`chars` has even more permutations available, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is the joined string of `perm`**
