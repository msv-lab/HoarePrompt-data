According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `perm` list and the condition `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluating to True. If the condition is met, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `perm` list needs to be adjusted to have more elements and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` needs to continue evaluating to True.
State: **`candidate` is the concatenated string of elements in the `perm` list and `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True, `perm` list is adjusted with more elements**
