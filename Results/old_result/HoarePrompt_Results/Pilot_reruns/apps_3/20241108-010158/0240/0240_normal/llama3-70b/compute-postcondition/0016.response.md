Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two string parameters s and t. It creates a set t_set containing unique elements from t. Then, it iterates over each character in s and appends the character to n if it exists in t_set. Finally, it appends the entire string t to n and returns the integer value of n. However, the current implementation might have a potential issue where if t_set is empty or s is an empty string, n will be an empty string, and returning int(n) might not be appropriate. This missing logic could lead to unexpected results in these cases. **
