Functionality: **The function `func` reads a non-negative integer `n` from the user input, calculates the remainder of `n` when divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, computes a result value. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is the subtraction of the remainder from `n`; otherwise, the result is the sum of `n` and the difference between 10 and the remainder. Finally, the function prints the calculated result. The function does not accept any parameters and operates on user input.**
