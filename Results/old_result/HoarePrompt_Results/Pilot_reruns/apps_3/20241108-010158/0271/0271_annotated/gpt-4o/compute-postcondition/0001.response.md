The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo 10. Since `n` is an input integer, the remainder will be the last digit of the input integer. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, remainder is the last digit of n.
Output State: **n is an input integer, remainder is the last digit of n**
