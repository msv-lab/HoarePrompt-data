Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program accurately implements the problem description. It correctly handles all possible cases where Vasya needs to round a non-negative integer to the nearest integer ending with zero. The program checks if the given number already ends with zero, in which case it prints the number itself. If not, it rounds the number to the nearest integer ending with zero by subtracting or adding the appropriate value based on the last digit of the number. The annotations also confirm that the program covers all edge cases within the specified range of non-negative integers. The examples provided in the problem description are also covered by the program, ensuring the correct output in those cases as well.
