Example Answer: 
The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying `denominator` with `total_days` and taking the modulo `MOD`. The values of `total_days`, `numerator`, and `i` are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 left-shifted by `n`, `numerator` is updated value based on the calculation `numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, `denominator` is an updated value, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 left-shifted by `n`, `numerator` is updated value based on the calculation `numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, `denominator` is an updated value, `i` is incremented by 1**
