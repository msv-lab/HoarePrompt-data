According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n` ensures that the loop will execute, `numerator` and `denominator` being 1 does not affect the loop execution. So, the states that need to be adjusted are `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
