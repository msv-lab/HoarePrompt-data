The function func_1 accepts two integer parameters a and b. It performs a series of operations on a and b within a while loop. If b is not equal to 0, a becomes the previous value of b, and b becomes the remainder of the division of the previous a by the previous b. The loop continues until b is equal to 0, at which point the function returns the final value of a.
