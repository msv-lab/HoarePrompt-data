Output State: **If k > 1 << n, then numerator is 1 and denominator is 1. If k <= 1 << n, then after the loop executes, `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 left-shifted by `n`, `numerator` contains the product of (total_days - i) for i ranging from 0 to k-1, `denominator` contains the product of total_days for i ranging from 0 to k-1**
