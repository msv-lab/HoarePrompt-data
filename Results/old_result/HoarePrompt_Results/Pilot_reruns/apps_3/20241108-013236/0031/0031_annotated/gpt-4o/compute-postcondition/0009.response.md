Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying the current value of `denominator` with `total_days` and then taking the modulo `MOD`. Since `total_days` is 1 left-shifted by `n`, the new value of `denominator` will be the previous value of `denominator` multiplied by 2 to the power of `n` modulo `MOD`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 left-shifted by `n`, `numerator` is updated value, `denominator` is updated value.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `k` is an integer, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 left-shifted by `n`, `numerator` is updated value, `denominator` is updated value**
