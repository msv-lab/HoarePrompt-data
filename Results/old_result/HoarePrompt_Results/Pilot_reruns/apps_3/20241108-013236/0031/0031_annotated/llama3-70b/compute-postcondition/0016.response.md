Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is updated by performing floor division with the variable `gcd`. The previous value of `denominator` and `gcd` is required to calculate the updated value of `denominator`. Since the initial state is not provided, we cannot determine the specific values. Therefore, the output state will be dependent on the previous calculations.
Output State: **output state**
