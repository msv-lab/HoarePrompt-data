Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It follows the given problem description and outputs the irreducible fraction A/B modulo 10^6 + 3 as required. The program handles the edge case where k is greater than 2^n and prints 1 1. The gcd function is correctly used to reduce A and B to their coprime form. The logic and calculations are correct based on the problem statement.
