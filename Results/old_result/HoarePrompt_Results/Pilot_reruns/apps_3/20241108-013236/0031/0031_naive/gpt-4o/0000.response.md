Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in Udayland. It follows the problem description and handles the edge cases where k is greater than 2^n or k = 1. The program calculates the numerator and denominator according to the given formula and then finds the irreducible fraction A/B by taking the modulo 10^6 + 3. The gcd function is used to determine the greatest common divisor and ensure that A and B are coprime. Overall, the program seems to be correct for all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
