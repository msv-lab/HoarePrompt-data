According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. Since `k` is the range of the loop, it needs to be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `total_days` is a value between 2 and 2^10^18 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`total_days` is a value between 2 and 2^10^18, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
