According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is a value between 2 and 2^10^18, `numerator` is updated to the value of `total_days`, `denominator` is updated to the value of `total_days`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0. Since `i` is 0, it needs to be adjusted to `i` is 1 for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`total_days` is a value between 2 and 2^10^18, `numerator` is updated to the value of `total_days`, `denominator` is updated to the value of `total_days`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
