Example Answer:
If k is greater than 0, `p_no_shared` will be assigned the value of `numerator` after the loop execution; If k is 0 or negative, `p_no_shared` will remain 1. `p_total` will be assigned the value of `denominator`. Then, `p_shared` will be calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`. The variables `numerator`, `denominator`, and `MOD` are not provided in the initial state, so their values are unknown.

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is either the value of `numerator` or 1 based on the value of k; `p_total` is the value of `denominator`; the value of `p_shared` is calculated based on the formula provided.**
