Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two integer inputs n and k, representing the number of days in a year and the number of people to be interviewed, respectively.
- The code correctly calculates the numerator and denominator values based on the value of k.
- The code determines the greatest common divisor (gcd) of these values and updates the denominator accordingly.
- Finally, the code returns the result of numerator % (10^6 + 3) and denominator % (10^6 + 3) as required.

The code follows the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints also agree with the code. The code correctly computes the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in Udayland.
