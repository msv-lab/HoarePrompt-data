Example Answer:
The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days` modulo `MOD`. Since the initial value of `denominator` is 1, and the value of `total_days` is unknown, the output state is: MOD is 1000003, numerator is updated based on the value of total_days, denominator is updated based on the value of total_days modulo MOD, i is 0, and k is greater than 0.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, numerator is updated based on the value of total_days, denominator is updated based on the value of total_days modulo MOD, i is 0, and k is greater than 0**
