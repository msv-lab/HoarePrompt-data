Example Answer: 
The value of `A` is modified by performing floor division with `g`. The previous values of the affected variables are not mentioned. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_no_shared` is either the value of `numerator` or 1 based on the value of `k`; `p_total` is the value of `denominator`; `B` is the value of `p_total`.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is either the value of `numerator` or 1 based on the value of `k`; `p_total` is the value of `denominator`; `B` is the value of `p_total`**
