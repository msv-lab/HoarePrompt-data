Example Answer:
`g` is assigned the result of calling `func_1` with arguments `A` and `B`. The values of `A` and `B` are not provided in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact value of `g`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_no_shared` is either the value of `numerator` or 1 based on the value of k; `p_total` is the value of `denominator`; `B` is the value of `p_total`.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is either the value of `numerator` or 1 based on the value of k; `p_total` is the value of `denominator`; `B` is the value of `p_total`**
