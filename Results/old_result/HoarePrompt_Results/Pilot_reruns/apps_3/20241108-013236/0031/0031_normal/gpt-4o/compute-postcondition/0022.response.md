Example Answer:
`B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `p_total` retains its value. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_no_shared` is either the value of `numerator` or 1 based on the value of k; `p_total` is the value of `denominator`; `B` is the value of `p_total`.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is either the value of `numerator` or 1 based on the value of k; `p_total` is the value of `denominator`; `B` is the value of `p_total`**
