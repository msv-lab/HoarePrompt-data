The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The parameters `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The `numerator` and `denominator` values are determined by the value of `k`, and the `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of these values. The `denominator` is updated accordingly. The function returns `numerator % (10` as the output. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and k, where n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The function calculates the numerator and denominator values based on the value of k, determines the greatest common divisor (gcd) of these values, updates the denominator accordingly, and returns the result of numerator % (10**.**
