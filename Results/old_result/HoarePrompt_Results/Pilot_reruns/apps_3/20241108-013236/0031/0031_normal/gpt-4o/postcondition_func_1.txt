The function func_2 accepts two integer parameters, n and k. It calculates certain values based on these parameters and prints the result. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints 1, 1. Otherwise, it performs a series of calculations involving numerator, denominator, p_no_shared, p_total, p_shared, A, B, and g, and then prints the modulo of A and B with MOD. The code does not cover what happens if k is less than or equal to 1 shifted left by n, potentially missing a calculation or print statement.
