Correctness: **False**

The given program simply calculates the absolute difference between the starting length x and the desired length y, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y should be calculated based on the specific operations mentioned in the problem description. 

For example, if we take the input (22, 4), the expected output should be 6. However, the program will output 18, which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case and is incorrect.
