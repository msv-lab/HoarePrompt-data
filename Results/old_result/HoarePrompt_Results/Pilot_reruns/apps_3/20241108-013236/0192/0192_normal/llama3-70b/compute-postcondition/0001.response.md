Example Answer:
The code calculates the absolute difference between `x` and `y` using the `abs` function and prints the result. Since `x` and `y` are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000, the absolute difference between them will always be a positive integer. Therefore, the output state is the same as the initial state.
Output State: **x and y are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100000**
