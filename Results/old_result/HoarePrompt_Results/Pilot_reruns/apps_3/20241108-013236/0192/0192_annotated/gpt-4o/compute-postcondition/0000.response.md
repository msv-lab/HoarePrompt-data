Example Answer:
The values of `x` and `y` are assigned by mapping integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of `x` and `y` should be integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Since the input is split by spaces, `x` is assigned the first integer and `y` is assigned the second integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is an integer greater than `y` with a minimum value of 3 and a maximum value of 100,000; `y` is an integer less than `x` with a minimum value of 3 and a maximum value of 99,999.
Output State: **`x` is an integer greater than `y` with a minimum value of 3 and a maximum value of 100,000; `y` is an integer less than `x` with a minimum value of 3 and a maximum value of 99,999**
