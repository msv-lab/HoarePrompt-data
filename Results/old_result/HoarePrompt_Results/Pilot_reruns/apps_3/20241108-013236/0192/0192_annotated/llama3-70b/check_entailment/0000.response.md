Correctness: False

The provided code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code simply calculates the absolute difference between the two input numbers, which is not the correct approach to solving the problem. The code does not implement the required logic of modifying the sides of the equilateral triangle to reach the desired side length. Therefore, the code is incorrect for this problem.
