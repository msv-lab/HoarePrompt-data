Postcondition: ***`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing the calculated values, `i` is `k - 1`, `k` is at least 1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement, maintaining the initial state of the variables.***
