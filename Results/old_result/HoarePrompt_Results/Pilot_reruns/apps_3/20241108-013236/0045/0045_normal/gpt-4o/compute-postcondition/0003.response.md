Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated by performing an integer division of `n` by `min_sum`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1 without changing the state of other variables. Otherwise, `d` will hold the result of the division. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division n // min_sum.
Output State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division n // min_sum**
