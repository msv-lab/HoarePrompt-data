Output State: **If `k` is at least 1 and `remainder` is positive, the loop will execute and decrement `remainder` by 1 for `k` iterations. At the end of the loop, `sequence` will contain the calculated values where the `i-th` element is incremented by 1. If `remainder` becomes 0 during the loop, the loop will break. If `k` is less than 1 or `remainder` is non-positive, the loop will not execute and the state will remain unchanged.**
