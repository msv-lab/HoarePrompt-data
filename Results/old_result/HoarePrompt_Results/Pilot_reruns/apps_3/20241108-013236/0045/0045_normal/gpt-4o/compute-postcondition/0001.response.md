Example Answer: 
The function returns `-1`, and `min_sum` is a positive integer, but the specific value of `min_sum` is unknown. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is `min_sum` is a positive integer, and the function returns -1.
Output State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer, and the function returns -1**
