Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases. 

1. The function `func_1` takes two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`. 
2. It calculates the minimum sum `min_sum` required based on the formula `k * (k + 1) // 2`.
3. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it returns -1, as expected.
4. Otherwise, it constructs a list `sequence` by incrementing values based on certain conditions.
5. If `k` is at least 1 and `remainder` is positive, the loop will update the elements of `sequence`.
6. If `remainder` becomes 0 during the loop, it will break.
7. If `k` is less than 1 or `remainder` is non-positive, the loop will not execute, and the function will return the original `sequence`.
8. The output format also seems to be correct, where if the result is -1, it prints -1; otherwise, it prints the resulting sequence. 

Overall, the code appears to be following the problem description accurately and the output hints also align with the code's functionality.
