Example Answer:
Each element in the `sequence` list is calculated by multiplying `d` with `(i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`. The previous values of `d`, `min_sum`, and `k` are known. Therefore, the output state is: `min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list containing the calculated values.
Output State: **`min_sum` is a positive integer, `d` is the result of the division `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing the calculated values**
