Example Answer:
`remainder` is calculated as the result of subtracting `d` multiplied by `min_sum` from `n`. The initial values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, and `d` are used in the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`; `d` is the result of n divided by `min_sum`; `remainder` is the result of the calculation.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`; `d` is the result of n divided by `min_sum`; `remainder` is the result of the calculation**
