Example Answer: 
`a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the remainder of `a` divided by `b`. Since the initial values of `a` and `b` are positive integers, after execution, `a` will have the original value of `b` and `b` will have the remainder of `a` divided by the original `b`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` have been swapped, and `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` have been swapped, and `b` is the remainder of the original `a` divided by the original `b`**
