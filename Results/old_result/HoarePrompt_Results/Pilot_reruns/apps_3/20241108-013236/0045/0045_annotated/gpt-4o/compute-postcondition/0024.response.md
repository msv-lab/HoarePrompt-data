The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. After executing the function body, if the sum of integers from 1 to `k` (denoted as `min_sum`) is greater than n, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function updates the values of `sequence`, `remainder`, and `k` until `remainder` reaches 0, and then returns the final value of `sequence`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculate the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, and return -1 if the sum is greater than n. Otherwise, it updates the values of `sequence`, `remainder`, and `k` until `remainder` reaches 0, and returns the final value of `sequence`.
