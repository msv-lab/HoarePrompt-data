According to the code, whether the loop can execute one more time depends on the condition that the remainder after dividing n by `min_sum` is not 0. If the remainder is 0, the loop should break. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of n divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the result of the calculation, `i` is `k - 1`.

To execute the loop one more time, the remainder should not be 0, so the remainder needs to be adjusted accordingly. The `sequence[i]` needs to be increased by 1, and `remainder` needs to be decreased by 1 for the next iteration.
