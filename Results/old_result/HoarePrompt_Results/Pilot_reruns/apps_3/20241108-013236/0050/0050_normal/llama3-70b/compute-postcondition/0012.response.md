Example Answer: 
The value of `shares` is incremented by the result of the floor division of `r` by `s[i]`. The previous values of `shares`, `r`, and `s[i]` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n+1`, `m`, `r`, `shares` is incremented by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]`, `s`, `b`.
Output State: **`n+1`, `m`, `r`, `shares` is incremented by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]`, `s`, `b`**
