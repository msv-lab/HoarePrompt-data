Example Answer: 
`min_buy_price` is assigned the minimum value of the list `s`, but the list `s` is not defined in the initial state. The variable `b` is a list of integers obtained from input. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`**
