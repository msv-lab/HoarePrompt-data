Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. The previous values of `n+1`, `m`, `r`, `shares`, `s`, and `b` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n+1`, `m`, `r` is updated to the remainder of the division, `shares` is incremented by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]`, `s`, `b`.
Output State: **`n+1`, `m`, `r` is updated to the remainder of the division, `shares` is incremented by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]`, `s`, `b`**
