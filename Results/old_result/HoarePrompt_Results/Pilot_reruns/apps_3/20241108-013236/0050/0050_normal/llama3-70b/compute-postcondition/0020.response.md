Postcondition: ***`n+1` is incremented by 1, `m`, `shares` are updated based on the conditions in the if statement. If r >= s[i], `shares` is incremented by r divided by s[i] and r is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i]. If r < s[i], `n` is incremented by 1, `m`, `r`, `shares`, `s`, `b` remain unchanged and the code breaks out of the loop. The variables `m`, `r`, `shares`, `s`, `b` do not change unless explicitly mentioned in the if or else part.***
