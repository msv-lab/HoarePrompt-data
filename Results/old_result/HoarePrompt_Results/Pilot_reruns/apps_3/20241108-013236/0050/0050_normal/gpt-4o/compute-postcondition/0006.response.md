Example Answer:
`max_shares` is assigned the value of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`. Since `n`, `m`, and `b` are not used in this code snippet, their values remain unaffected. The minimum buy price is obtained from the list `b`, so `min_buy_price` is a value from the list. The maximum sell price is also obtained from the list `b`, so `max_sell_price` is a value from the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers satisfying the constraints, `b` is a list of integers obtained from input, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in the list, `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`**
