Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `shares`, `s`, `b` have updated values based on the loop's conditions. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. Otherwise, the loop is broken out of, and the state of all variables is determined by the loop's conditions.***
