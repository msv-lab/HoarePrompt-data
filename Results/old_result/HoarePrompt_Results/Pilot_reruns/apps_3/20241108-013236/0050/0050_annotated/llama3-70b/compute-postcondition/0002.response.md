Example Answer: 
The list `b` is created by mapping integer conversion to the input split by spaces. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a list of integers created from user input, and `b` is a list of integers created from user input split.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values based on user input, `s` is a list of integers created from user input, and `b` is a list of integers created from user input split**
