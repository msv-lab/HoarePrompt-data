Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `m`, `r`, `s`, and `b` have user-assigned values, `r` is either greater than or equal to any element in `s` or less than any element in `s`, `shares` is 0, `i` is one more than the previous iteration. If shares > 0, `shares` is assigned the value 0 and `r` is updated by adding the product of shares and b[i]. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
