Example Answer: 
The list `b` is assigned the result of converting the input string into a list of integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input**
