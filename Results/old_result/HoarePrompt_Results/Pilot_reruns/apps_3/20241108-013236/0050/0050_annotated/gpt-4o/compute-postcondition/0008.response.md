Example Answer:
`total_bourles` is calculated by multiplying `max_shares` by `max_sell_price` and adding `remaining_bourles`. The values of `max_shares`, `max_sell_price`, and `remaining_bourles` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`; `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by the minimum value in list `b`, and `total_bourles` is calculated as described.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`; `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by the minimum value in list `b`, and `total_bourles` is calculated**
