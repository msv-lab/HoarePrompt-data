Example Answer: 
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. Since the input values are restricted to the given ranges, the values of `n`, `m`, and `r` will be integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000**
