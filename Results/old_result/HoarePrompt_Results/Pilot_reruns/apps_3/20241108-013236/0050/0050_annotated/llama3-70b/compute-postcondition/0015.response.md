Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than the current value, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is updated by adding the floor division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
