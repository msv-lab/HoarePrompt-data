Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, the function calculates `max_shares` as the integer division of `r` by the minimum buy price, `remaining_bourles` as the remainder of dividing `r` by the minimum buy price, and `total_bourles` as the sum of the product of `max_shares` and `max_sell_price` with `remaining_bourles`. The final output is the value of `total_bourles`.***
