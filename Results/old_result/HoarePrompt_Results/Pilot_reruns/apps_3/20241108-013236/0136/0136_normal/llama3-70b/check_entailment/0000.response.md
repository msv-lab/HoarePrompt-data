Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` from input, each with no leading zeros and no more than 10^6 digits. It then compares the values of `a` and `b` and prints the corresponding symbol based on the comparison result. The code accurately follows the problem description for all potential cases. The output symbols '<', '>', and '=' are correctly printed when `a` is less than, greater than, or equal to `b` respectively. The code handles the case where the numbers contain leading zeros by removing them before comparison, ensuring that the output is correct. Overall, the code meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
