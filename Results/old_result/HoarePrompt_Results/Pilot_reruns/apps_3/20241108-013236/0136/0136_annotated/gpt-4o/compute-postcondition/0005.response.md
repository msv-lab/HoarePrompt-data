Example Answer: 
Since `b` is directly assigned the value '0', the value of `b` is now '0'. The value of `a` remains the same as the first element of the list `data` without leading zeros. If `a` is empty, it is assigned the value '0'. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is the first element of the list `data` without leading zeros. If `a` is empty, then `a` is assigned the value '0'; `b` is '0'.
Output State: **`a` is the first element of the list `data` without leading zeros. If `a` is empty, then `a` is assigned the value '0'; `b` is '0'**
