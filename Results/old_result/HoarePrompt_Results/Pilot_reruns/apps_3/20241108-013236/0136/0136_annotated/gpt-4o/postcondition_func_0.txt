The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. It reads two non-negative integer strings `a` and `b` from the user input, removes leading zeros, and compares them. If the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, it prints '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. The function ensures that `a` and `b` are correctly updated and compared, handling cases where `a` and/or `b` are empty strings and assigning them the value '0' accordingly.
