Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input integers a and b, removes any leading zeroes, and compares them as per the problem description. It then prints the correct symbol "<", ">", or "=" based on the comparison. The program handles the cases where a < b, a > b, and a = b as expected. The logic provided covers all possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description.
