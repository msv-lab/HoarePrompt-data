Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program reads two non-negative integers a and b as strings from the input.
2. Leading zeroes in both a and b are removed using the lstrip() function.
3. If after removing leading zeroes, a or b becomes an empty string, it is set to '0'.
4. The program then compares the lengths of a and b. If the length of a is less than b, it prints '<', if the length of a is greater than b, it prints '>', otherwise, it compares the values of a and b as strings and prints '<', '>', or '=' accordingly.
5. The program handles the case where a and b are equal by checking if a is less than or greater than b.

Overall, the program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description for all potential cases and should provide the correct output.
