Output State: **`block_a` and `floor_a` remain the same, `block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned the block and floor locations of position `b`. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is initialized to 0. Otherwise, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 plus the value of `floor_a - 1`. `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b` modulo `n` multiplied by 15. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15**
