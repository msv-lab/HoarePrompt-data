Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000 and 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k. 

The function calculates the `time_to_target_floor` based on the formula `(floor_b - 1) * 5`, then determines `total_time` as the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. 

However, the annotations mention updating `block_a`, `floor_a`, `block_b`, `floor_b`, `a`, `b`, and `n`, but there is no actual update happening in the code. Also, the code lacks handling potential edge cases such as division by zero when calculating `min_walk_time`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function includes calculating the `total_time` based on the provided parameters, but it does not actually update any values as mentioned in the annotations. Additionally, there is a missing check for division by zero when calculating `min_walk_time`.
