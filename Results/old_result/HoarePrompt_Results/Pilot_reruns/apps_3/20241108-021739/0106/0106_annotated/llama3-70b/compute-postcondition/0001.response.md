Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned values from the input after splitting it. The values of `a` and `b` are integers obtained from the input split. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: n, m, and k are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers.
Output State: **n, m, and k are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000, `a` and `b` are input integers**
