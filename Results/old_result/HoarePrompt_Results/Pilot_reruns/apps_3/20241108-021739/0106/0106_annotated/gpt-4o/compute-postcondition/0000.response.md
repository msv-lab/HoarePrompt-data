Example Answer:
The value of `block` is calculated based on the formula provided, where `apartment`, `m`, and `k` are used in the calculation. Given the constraints on the values of `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, the output state is: **m, n, k, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m, n, k, a, b ≤ 1000; block is calculated based on the formula provided**.
Output State: **m, n, k, a, and b are positive integers such that 1 ≤ m, n, k, a, b ≤ 1000; block is calculated based on the formula provided**.
