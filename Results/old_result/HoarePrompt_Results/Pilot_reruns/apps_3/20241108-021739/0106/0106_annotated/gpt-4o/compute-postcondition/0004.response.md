The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`, where `apartment` is a positive integer representing the floor number. The function also accepts positive integers `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, and `b` such that 1 ≤ `m`, `n`, `k`, `a`, `b` ≤ 1000. After executing the function, it returns a positive integer `floor`, which represents the location of the apartment within the building based on the input parameters.
