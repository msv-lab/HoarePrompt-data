Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the problem description. It considers the time needed to exit the building, the time for direct and reverse walks around the building, and the time to reach the target floor. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem requirements and covers all potential cases. Therefore, the program is correct.
