Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input, followed by a list of integers `a`. It sorts the list `a` and then iterates through it to check if each element is twice the previous element. If this condition is not met, it increments `m`. Finally, it prints the value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value. **
