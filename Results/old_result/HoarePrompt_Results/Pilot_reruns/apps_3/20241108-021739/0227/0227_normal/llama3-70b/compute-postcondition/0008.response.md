Example Answer:
`m` is increased by 1. The previous value of `m` can either be 1 or 2 depending on the condition mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `m` is either 1 or 2.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `m` is either 1 or 2**
