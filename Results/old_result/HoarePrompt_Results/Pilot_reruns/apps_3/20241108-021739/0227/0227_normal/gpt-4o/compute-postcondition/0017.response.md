Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest and next smallest positive integers in list `a`, `i` is 1, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True. If the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is satisfied, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is broken.***
