Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the new elements `a[i+1]` and `a[i+2]`, `can_form` is True if `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `m` remains unchanged, `x` is the second element in the `assigned` list. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `can_form` is True, and the most internal loop or if statement is exited.***
