According to the code, the loop can execute if the list `assigned` is not empty. The loop iterates through the elements in the `assigned` list. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `assigned` list must have at least one element. At the start of the loop, `x` will be the first element in the `assigned` list. Thus, to execute the loop, `assigned` list should have at least one element and `x` should be the first element in the list.

State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of distinct positive integers in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest and subsequent positive integers in list `a` with at least one element, `i` is 2, `x` is the first element in the `assigned` list, `can_form` is False**
