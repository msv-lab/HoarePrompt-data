Postcondition: ***`assigned` is a list. If `assigned` is not empty and there exists an element x in `assigned` such that the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and `m` is increased by 1. If no such element exists, `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is empty, `can_form` is False and `m` remains unchanged.***
