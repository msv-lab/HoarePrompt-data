According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1 since the range starts at 1 and goes up to `n-1`. To ensure the loop executes, you need to adjust the state to `n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, and `m` is 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 1**
