Correctness: False

The program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It is not finding the minimum number of variables m to perform the sequence of operations. The logic implemented in the program seems to be incorrect as it is not following the rules described in the problem statement. Additionally, the input reading method is also incorrect. 

Here is an example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
3
3 6 5

Expected Output:
-1

Actual Output:
2

The program is giving an incorrect output for the above input case, therefore the correctness is False.
