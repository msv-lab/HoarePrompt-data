Example Answer:
The value of `m` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `m` is 2. After execution, `m` is 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3.
Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 3**
