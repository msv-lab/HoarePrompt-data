Example Answer:
The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The addition of the smallest positive integer in list `a` to the set `assigned` and assigning it to variable `x` does not affect the variable `can_form`. Therefore, the Output State is: The smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `x` is the smallest positive integer in list `a`, and `can_form` is True.
Output State: **The smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `x` is the smallest positive integer in list `a`, `can_form` is True**
