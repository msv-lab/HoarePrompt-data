The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer in the range of 1 to 23, and `a`, which is a list of distinct positive integers where each value in the list is between 1 and 10^9. 

After executing the function body, the function returns `m`, which is an integer representing the number of elements in the list `assigned`, `assigned` contains positive integers from list `a`, `can_form` is a boolean variable that is True if there exists an element `a[i] - x` in `assigned`, where `i` is the index of the last iteration, and `a` remains unchanged and contains positive integers.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`, then determine the number of elements in the list `assigned`, check if there exists an element in `assigned` that can be formed by subtracting an element from `a`, and return the required values as described above.
