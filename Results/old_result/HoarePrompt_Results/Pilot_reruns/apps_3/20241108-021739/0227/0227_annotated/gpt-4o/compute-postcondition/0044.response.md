According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `assigned`. If `assigned` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. At the end of the last iteration, `can_form` is False. So for the loop to be executed, `assigned` must have at least 1 element, and `x` is the first element in `assigned`.
State: **`m` is an integer, `a` contains positive integers, `can_form` is False, `i` is the index of the last iteration, `assigned` contains at least 1 element, `x` is the first element in `assigned`**
