Example Answer:
The value of `m` is incremented by 1, so after execution, `m` becomes 3. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2.
Output State: **`a` is a sorted list of integers, `m` is 3, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 2**
