According to the code, the loop can execute if the set `assigned` is not empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the set `assigned` must have at least one element. At the start of the loop, `m` is 1 and `n` is greater than 1 are not relevant to the loop execution. Additionally, `can_form` being False does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are that the set `assigned` has at least one element and `x` is the smallest positive integer in list `a`.
State: **The smallest positive integer in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`, `x` is the smallest positive integer in list `a`**
