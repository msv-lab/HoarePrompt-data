The function `func` reads a positive integer `T` representing the number of test cases. For each test case, it reads integers `n` and `x`, a binary string `s`, calculates the counts of '0's and '1's in `s`, and determines the balance between them. Depending on the balance compared to `x`, the function prints different values. If the balance is equal to `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1)) + 1`. The function does not explicitly return any values, it directly prints the results for each test case.
