According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `T`. If `T` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `data` contains split elements of the input does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `T` is greater than 0. `index` is not relevant for the loop execution, and `results` list being empty is fine at the start.
State: **`data` contains split elements of the input, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` list is empty**
