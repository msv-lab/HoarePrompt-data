According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the new calculated balance value, and `prefix_balances[i+2]` remains unchanged. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `prefix_balances[i+1]` should be updated to the new calculated balance value.
State: **`prefix_balances[i+1]` is updated to the new calculated balance value, `prefix_balances[i+3]` remains unchanged**
