Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the element at index position `index + 2` in the `data` list. Since `index` is 1, `s` will be assigned the element at index 3 in `data`. The values of other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `data` contains split elements of the input, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` list is empty, `n` is assigned the integer value at index position in `data`, `x` is assigned the integer value at index + 1 position in `data`, and `s` is assigned the element at index 3 in `data`.
Output State: **`data` contains split elements of the input, `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` list is empty, `n` is assigned the integer value at index position in `data`, `x` is assigned the integer value at index + 1 position in `data`, and `s` is assigned the element at index 3 in `data`**
