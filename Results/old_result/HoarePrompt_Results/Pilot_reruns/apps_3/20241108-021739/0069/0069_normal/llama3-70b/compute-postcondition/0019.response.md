Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input split by space, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in input string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in input string `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`, `_` is incremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input split by space, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0' and '1' in string `s`, `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, then the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints `((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1)) + 1`. This covers all scenarios where the condition is met and not met, ensuring the correct output for each case.***
