Postcondition: ***`T`, `n`, `x` are positive integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in input string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in input string `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`, `_` is incremented by 2, `s` is assigned the input string. If the condition `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0` is true, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is printed. This covers all cases including the scenario where the denominator `cnt0 - cnt1` becomes 0, ensuring the division is handled correctly.***
