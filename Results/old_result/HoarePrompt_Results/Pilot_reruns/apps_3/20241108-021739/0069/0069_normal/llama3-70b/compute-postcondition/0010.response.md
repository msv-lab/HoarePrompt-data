Postcondition: ***`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input split by space, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in input string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in input string `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, then `n + 1` is printed. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the code snippet prints -1. In all other cases, it prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`***
