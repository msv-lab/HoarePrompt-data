Example Answer:
The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0' and '1' respectively in the string `s`. The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` will depend on the input string `s`. 
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input split by space, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in input string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in input string `s`**
