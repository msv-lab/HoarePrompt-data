Example Answer: 
`prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the new calculated balance value based on the previous balance at index `i - 1` and the value of `s[i - 1]`. The value of `prefix_balances[i+2]` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the new calculated balance value, `prefix_balances[i+2]` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the new calculated balance value, `prefix_balances[i+2]` remains unchanged**
