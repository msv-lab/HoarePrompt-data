According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 5, `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be updated to 6.
State: **`index` is 3, `balance` is calculated based on string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 6, and the updated value of `prefix_balances[4]` is determined based on the condition mentioned above**
