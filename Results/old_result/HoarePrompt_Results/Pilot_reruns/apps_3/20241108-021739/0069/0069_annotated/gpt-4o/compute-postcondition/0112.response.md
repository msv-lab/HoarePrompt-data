Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads input data for test cases consisting of integers and binary strings. It then processes each test case by calculating balances and prefix sums. Depending on the calculated values, the function appends specific results to a list. Finally, it prints out the results for each test case. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
