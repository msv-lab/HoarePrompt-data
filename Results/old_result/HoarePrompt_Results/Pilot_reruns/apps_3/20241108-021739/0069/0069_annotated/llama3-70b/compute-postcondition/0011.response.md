According to the code, the loop execution depends on the value of `T`. At the end of the last iteration, `T` is a positive integer. To execute the loop one more time, `T` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **T is a positive integer + 1, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`.**
