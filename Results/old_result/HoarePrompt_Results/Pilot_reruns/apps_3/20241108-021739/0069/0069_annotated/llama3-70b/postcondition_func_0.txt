The function `func` reads an integer `T` from the input, then iterates `T` times. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, a string `s`, counts the occurrences of '0' and '1' in `s`, calculates the balance between '0' and '1', and based on certain conditions, prints `n + 1`, -1, or the result of a division calculation. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
