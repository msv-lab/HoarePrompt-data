Correctness: False

The given program does not completely follow the problem description for every potential case. The annotations indicate that the program should output the number of prefixes of the infinite string $t$ with a balance equal to $x$, and it correctly calculates this based on the input string $s$. However, the program fails to handle the case where there is an infinite number of such prefixes correctly.

In the case where the balance of the string does not match the desired balance $x$ and the difference between $x$ and the balance is divisible by the difference between the counts of '0' and '1' in the string, the program should output -1. However, the program incorrectly outputs $((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)$ instead of -1 in this scenario. This is a deviation from the problem description and thus makes the program incorrect. 

An example where the program fails is for the input:
2
3 0
000
3 0
111

The correct outputs should be:
-1
-1

But the program will output:
4
4
