Output State: **`count` is an integer, `index` is 3, `balance` is calculated based on string `s`, `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` has at least 1 element. If (x - b) % balance is 0 and (x - b) // balance is greater than or equal to 0, then `count` is increased by the total number of prefix_balances that satisfy the conditions. If prefix_balances is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0.**
