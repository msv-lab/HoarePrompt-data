Example Answer:
The variable `balance` is assigned the result of subtracting the count of '1's from the count of '0's in the string `s`. No other variables are affected by this operation. 
Output State: **`index` is incremented by 3, `balance` is calculated as the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in string `s`**.
