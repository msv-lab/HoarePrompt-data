Example Answer:
The code appends the value of `count` to the `results` list. The value of `count` is determined by the number of iterations where both conditions are met. If `prefix_balances` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains 0. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is an integer with a certain value, `results` list contains the appended `count` value.
Output State: **`count` is an integer with a certain value, `results` list contains the appended `count` value**
