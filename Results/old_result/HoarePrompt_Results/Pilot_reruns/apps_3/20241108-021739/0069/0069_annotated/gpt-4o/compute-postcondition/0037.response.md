According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the loop calculates the prefix sum of balances based on the values in the `s` list. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop won't execute, so `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The loop calculates the prefix sum of balances based on the values in the `s` list. If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` will be updated with the new prefix sum.**
