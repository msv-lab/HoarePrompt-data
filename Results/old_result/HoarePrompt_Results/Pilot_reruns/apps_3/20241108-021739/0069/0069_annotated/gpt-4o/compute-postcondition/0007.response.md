Example Answer:
The value of `x` is assigned as the integer value at index `index + 1` of the `data` list. Since `index` is 1, `x` will be assigned the integer value at index 2 of the `data` list. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: $T$ is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the `data` list.
Output State: **$T$ is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` is a list containing at least one element, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of the `data` list**
