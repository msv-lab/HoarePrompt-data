Example Answer: 
A new value `i` is appended to either `d_queue` or `r_queue` based on the initial state of the votes string. If the first character of the votes string is 'D', then `i` is appended to `d_queue`, otherwise `i` is appended to `r_queue`. The number of employees `n` and the votes string remain unchanged.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 2 characters; d_queue or r_queue has the new value of `i` appended based on the initial state of the votes string**
