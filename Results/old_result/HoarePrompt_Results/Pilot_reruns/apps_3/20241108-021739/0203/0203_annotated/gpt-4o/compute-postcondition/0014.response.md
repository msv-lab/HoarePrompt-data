Example Answer: 
If the first character in the votes string is not 'D', then the value of i is added to the r_queue. If the first character is 'D', then r_queue remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: n is an integer representing the number of employees; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 3 characters. If the first character in the votes string is 'D', then d_queue contains index 1 and r_queue remains unchanged. If the first character in the votes string is not 'D', then r_queue contains index 1 and d_queue remains unchanged, and r_queue contains the added index i.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of employees; votes is a string representing the votes with at least 3 characters. If the first character in the votes string is 'D', then d_queue contains index 1 and r_queue remains unchanged. If the first character in the votes string is not 'D', then r_queue contains index 1 and d_queue remains unchanged, and r_queue contains the added index i.**
