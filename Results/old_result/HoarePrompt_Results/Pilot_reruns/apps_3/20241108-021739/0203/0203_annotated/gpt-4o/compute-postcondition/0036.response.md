Output State: **If both d_queue and r_queue are initially empty, the loop will not execute. If either d_queue or r_queue is empty after some iterations, the loop will end. If d_queue and r_queue have elements, their indexes will be manipulated based on the comparison of d_index and r_index. The loop will continue until one of the queues becomes empty.**
