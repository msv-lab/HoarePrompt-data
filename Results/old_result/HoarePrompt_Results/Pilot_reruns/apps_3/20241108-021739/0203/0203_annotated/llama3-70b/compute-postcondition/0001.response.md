Example Answer:
`fractions` is assigned the value of `input()`, where `input` accepts an input. The value of `n` representing the fractions of employees is not directly affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the fractions of employees, where 'D' represents depublicans and 'R' represents remocrats.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the fractions of employees, where 'D' represents depublicans and 'R' represents remocrats**
