Example Answer: 
If the last character in the `fractions` list is 'D', then `depublicans` will be incremented by 1. If not, `remocrats` will be incremented by 1. The state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a list of characters with at least 2 elements, and either `depublicans` or `remocrats` is incremented by 1 based on the last character in the list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a list of characters with at least 2 elements, and either `depublicans` or `remocrats` is incremented by 1 based on the last character in the list**
