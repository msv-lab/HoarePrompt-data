Example Answer:
`depublicans` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `depublicans` is unknown, but it is increased by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a list of characters with at least 3 elements, appropriate increments have been made to either `depublicans` or `remocrats` based on the logic of the if-else block, `depublicans` has been incremented by 1.
