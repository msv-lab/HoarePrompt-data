According to the code, the loop will execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. So, for the loop to execute one more time, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` need to be adjusted to ensure they are not empty. Additionally, depending on the scenario where `d_index` is less than `r_index` or `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, the respective queues need to be modified accordingly. No other states need adjustment.
State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', d_queue and r_queue are modified based on the scenario, d_index and r_index are updated based on the scenario.**
