Postcondition: ***n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. If v is 'D', d_queue contains the appended index i, r_queue is an empty list, i is the index of the last character iterated over, and v is the last character iterated over. If v is 'R', d_queue contains 0 if the first character in the string votes is 'D', otherwise it is an empty list, r_queue contains the appended index i, i is the index of the last character iterated over, and v is the last character iterated over.***
