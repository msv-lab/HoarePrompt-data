Example Answer: 
The string `votes` is assigned the input value after stripping any leading or trailing whitespaces. The length of the string `votes` is n, which is an integer between 1 and 200,000. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 200,000; votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000; votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
