Functionality: The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n` consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'. It then processes the votes by assigning indices to 'D' and 'R' characters, simulating a voting queue. The function iterates through the queues of 'D' and 'R' characters, adjusting indices based on comparisons, and prints 'D' or 'R' depending on the remaining elements in the queues. If either queue becomes empty during processing, the function terminates. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, as it reads input from the user.
