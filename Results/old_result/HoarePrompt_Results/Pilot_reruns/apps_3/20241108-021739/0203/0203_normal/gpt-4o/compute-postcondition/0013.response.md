Example Answer:
The value of i is appended to the d_queue list. The previous values of the variables are n, votes, v, and i. After execution, the d_queue list will contain the appended value of i. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', v is the last character iterated over, i is the index of the last character iterated over + 1, d_queue contains the appended value of i.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', v is the last character iterated over, i is the index of the last character iterated over + 1, d_queue contains the appended value of i**
