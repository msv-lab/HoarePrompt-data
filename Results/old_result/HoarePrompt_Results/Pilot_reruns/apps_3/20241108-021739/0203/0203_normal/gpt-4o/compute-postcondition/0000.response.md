Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` is between 1 and 200,000 as per the precondition. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 200,000; votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'.
Output State: **n is an integer between 1 and 200,000; votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**
