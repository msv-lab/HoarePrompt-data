Example Answer:
`d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue` using the `pop(0)` method. The value that was removed from `d_queue` is now stored in `d_index`, and `d_queue` no longer contains that value. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer between 1 and 200,000, votes is a string of length at least 1 consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` has been modified, `r_queue` may have been modified based on the specific scenario, `r_index` contains the value removed from the front of `r_queue`, and either `d_queue` or `r_queue` has been appended with the value of the corresponding index plus n.
