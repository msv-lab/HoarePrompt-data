Example Answer:
`remocrats` is assigned the value 0. The state of `n`, `fractions`, and `depublicans` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, fractions consists of n characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R'; `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0.
Output State: **n is an input integer, fractions consists of n characters where each character is either 'D' or 'R'; `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
