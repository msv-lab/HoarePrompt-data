According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range 1 to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`n`, `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing `remainder`, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
