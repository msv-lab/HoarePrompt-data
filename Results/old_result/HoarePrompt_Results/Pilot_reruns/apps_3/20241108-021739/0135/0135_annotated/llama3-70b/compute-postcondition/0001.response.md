Example Answer:
The set `seen` is initialized as an empty set. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is an empty set**
