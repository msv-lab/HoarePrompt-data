Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, where `n` and `i` are given as 3 and `i` as 3. Therefore, the value of `remainder` is 0. The other variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, `i` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `seen`, `i` remain unchanged, `remainder` is 0**
