According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` from 1 to k inclusive. The loop will execute as long as k is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is an empty set, and `i` is 1 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1**
