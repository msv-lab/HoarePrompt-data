Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes two integers n and k as input, calculates the remainder of n divided by each integer from 1 to k, and checks if all remainders are distinct. If any remainder is repeated, it prints 'No', otherwise it prints 'Yes'. The logic of the code aligns with the requirements of the problem description, and it handles all potential cases as specified. Therefore, the code is correct.
