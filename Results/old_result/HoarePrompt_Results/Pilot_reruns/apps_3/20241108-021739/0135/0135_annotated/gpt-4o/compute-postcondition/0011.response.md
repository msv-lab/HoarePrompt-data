According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive number, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is the remainder of `k` divided by 3, which is between 0 and 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to 4.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive number, `i` is 4, `remainder` is the remainder of `k` divided by 3, which is between 0 and 2**
