Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive number, `i` is between 1 and `k`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. If `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the loop stops and returns 'No'. Otherwise, `seen_remainders` contains all unique remainders calculated so far. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute.**
