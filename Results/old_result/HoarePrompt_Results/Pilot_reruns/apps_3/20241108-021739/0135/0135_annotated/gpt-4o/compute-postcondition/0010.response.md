Example Answer: 
The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`, where `n` is not defined in the initial state. However, `k` is a positive number, and `i` is 3. Therefore, `remainder` will be the remainder when dividing `k` by 3. Since `k` is a positive number, the remainder will be between 0 and 2 inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive number, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of `k` divided by 3, which is between 0 and 2.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive number, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of `k` divided by 3, which is between 0 and 2**
