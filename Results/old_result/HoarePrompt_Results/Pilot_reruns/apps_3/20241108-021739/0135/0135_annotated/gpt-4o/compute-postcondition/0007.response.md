According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive number, `i` is 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is a positive number, `i` is 2**
