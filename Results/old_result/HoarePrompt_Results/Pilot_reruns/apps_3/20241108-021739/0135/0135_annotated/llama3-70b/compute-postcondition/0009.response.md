Example Answer:
The remainder is calculated as n % i, where n and i are integers. The initial value of i is 2, so the remainder is n % 2. As n and k are integers within the given range, n % 2 will result in either 0 or 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing `remainder`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is either 0 or 1.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing `remainder`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
