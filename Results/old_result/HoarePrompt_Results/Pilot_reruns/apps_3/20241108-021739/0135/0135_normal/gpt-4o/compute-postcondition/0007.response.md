According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`. If the remainder of `n` divided by `i` is in the set `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Since `i` should be less than or equal to `k`, the updated value of `i` should be 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`**
