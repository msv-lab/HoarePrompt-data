According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, `remainder` is 1 or 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, `remainder` is 1 or 0**
