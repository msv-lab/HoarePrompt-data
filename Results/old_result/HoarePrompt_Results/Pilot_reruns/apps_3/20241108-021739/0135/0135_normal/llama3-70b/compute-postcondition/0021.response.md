Output State: **If `k` is greater than 0, the loop will execute for `k` times. After the loop, `seen` will contain unique remainders obtained from `n % i` for each `i` from 1 to `k`. If any remainder is already in `seen`, the program will print 'No' and exit. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and `seen` will remain an empty set.**
