According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 1, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is 0, 1, or 2. Since `i` is 3 and the loop is iterating from 1 to `k`, the loop can execute one more time if `k` is at least 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than `k`, `k` is at least 4, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, `remainder` is 0, 1, or 2**
