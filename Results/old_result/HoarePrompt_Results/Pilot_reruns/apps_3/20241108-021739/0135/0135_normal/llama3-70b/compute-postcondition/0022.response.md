Output State: **If `k` is greater than 0 and unique remainders are obtained from `n % i`, `seen` will contain the unique remainders. If any remainder is already in `seen`, the program will print 'No' and exit. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and `seen` will remain an empty set.**
