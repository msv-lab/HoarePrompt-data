According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are input integers, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the result of n % i. If the `remainder` is already present in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits without altering any variable values.

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the result of n % i**
