Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A. Then, it iterates from 1 to the square root of the gcd to find the maximum divisor that satisfies the condition. The logic in the program is sound and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
