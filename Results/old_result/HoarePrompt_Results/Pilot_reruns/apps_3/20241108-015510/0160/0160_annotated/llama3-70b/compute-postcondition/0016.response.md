Postcondition: ***N is at least 2, gcd is updated to the greatest common divisor of elements in list A, K is based on user input, A is a list of integers based on user input, max_divisor is assigned the value of the maximum between max_divisor and gcd // i, i is 1, and int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1 is greater than 1. After the execution of the if block, the value of max_divisor is updated to the maximum between its current value and gcd // i if gcd % i == 0. This postcondition covers all possible cases and edge scenarios of the program logic.***
