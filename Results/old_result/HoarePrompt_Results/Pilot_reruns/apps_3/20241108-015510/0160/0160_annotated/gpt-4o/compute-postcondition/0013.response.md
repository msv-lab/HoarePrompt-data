According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set. To execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than the square root of `x`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`divisors` is a set, `i` is less than the square root of `x`**
