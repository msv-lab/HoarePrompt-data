Postcondition: ***`N` is at least 2, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of elements in list `A`, `K` is based on user input, `A` is a list of integers based on user input. If i * i is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of dividing `gcd` by `i`.***
