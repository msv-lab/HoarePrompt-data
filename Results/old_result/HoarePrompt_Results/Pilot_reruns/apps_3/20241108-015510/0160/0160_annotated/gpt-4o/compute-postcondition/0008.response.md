Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set, `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. If x is divisible by i, then both i and the result of x divided by i are added to the set divisors. The postcondition covers all possible cases where x is divisible by i and updates the set divisors accordingly.***
