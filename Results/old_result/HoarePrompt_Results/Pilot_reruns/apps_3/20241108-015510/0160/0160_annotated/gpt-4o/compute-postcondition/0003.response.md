Example Answer:
The value of `x` is divided by `i`, and the result is added to the set `divisors`. Since `divisors` contains the value of `i`, and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1, after execution, the set `divisors` will have the updated values. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`divisors` contains the updated values after dividing `x` by `i`.**
