Output State: **`N` is at least 2, `K` is 0 or greater, `A` is a list of integers with at least one element, `gcd` will contain the greatest common divisor of all elements in list `A`. If `N` is less than 2, the loop won't execute and `gcd` will remain as the first element of `A`, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`.**
