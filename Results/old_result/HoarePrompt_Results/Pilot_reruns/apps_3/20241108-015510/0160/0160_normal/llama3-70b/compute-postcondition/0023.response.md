Example Answer:
max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between max_divisor and i. The previous values of max_divisor and i are known. Therefore, the Output State is: N is at least 2, K is 0 or greater, A is a list of integers with at least one element, gcd is a valid integer calculated from elements in list A, max_divisor is updated based on the comparison with integer i, i is updated to the next value in the range, and max_divisor is updated to the maximum of its previous value and i.
