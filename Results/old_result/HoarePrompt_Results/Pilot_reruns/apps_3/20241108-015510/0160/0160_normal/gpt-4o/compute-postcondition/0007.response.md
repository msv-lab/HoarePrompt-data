Example Answer:
The value of `x` divided by `i` is added to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` now contains the newly added integer `x // i`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` contains the newly added integer `x // i`.
Output State: **`divisors` contains the newly added integer `x // i`**
