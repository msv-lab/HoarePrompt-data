Since the loop uses `math.sqrt(gcd)` as the upper limit of the range, the loop will execute if `gcd` is a valid integer. To ensure the loop executes, `gcd` should be a valid integer calculated from the list `A`. 
State: **`N` is at least 2, `K` is 0 or greater, `A` is a list of integers with at least one element, `gcd` is a valid integer calculated from elements in list `A`, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of `gcd`**
