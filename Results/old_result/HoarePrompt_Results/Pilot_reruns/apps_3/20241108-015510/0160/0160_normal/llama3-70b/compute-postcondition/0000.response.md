Example Answer:
N and K are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. The input is split into two integers, so N and K will take on those values. The values of N and K are restricted by the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9.
Output State: **N and K are integers such that 2 <= N <= 500, 0 <= K <= 10^9**
