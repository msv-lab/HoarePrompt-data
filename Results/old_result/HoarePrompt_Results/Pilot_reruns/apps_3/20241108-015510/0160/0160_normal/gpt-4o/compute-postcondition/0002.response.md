Example Answer:
The value `i` is added to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is not defined in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact value that is added to `divisors`. Therefore, the output state is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, and `divisors` includes the divisors of x which is a perfect square.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i where 1 <= i <= N, and `divisors` includes the divisors of x which is a perfect square**
