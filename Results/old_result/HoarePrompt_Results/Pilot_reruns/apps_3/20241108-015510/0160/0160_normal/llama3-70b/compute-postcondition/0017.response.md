According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is at least 2, `K` is 0 or greater, `A` is a list of integers with at least one element, `gcd` is a valid integer calculated from elements in list `A`, `max_divisor` is the maximum value between the initial `gcd` and `i`.

To execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be adjusted. As the loop condition is `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`, the next `i` should be the next integer after the current square root of `gcd`.

State: **N is at least 2, K is 0 or greater, A is a list of integers with at least one element, gcd is a valid integer calculated from elements in list A, max_divisor is the maximum value between the initial gcd and the next integer after the current square root of gcd.**
