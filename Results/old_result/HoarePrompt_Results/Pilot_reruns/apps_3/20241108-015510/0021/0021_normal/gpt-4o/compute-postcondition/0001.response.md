Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values input by splitting the input string into integers. The list `a` now contains n distinct integers from 1 to n. Since n is in the range 2 <= n <= 100, the list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n within that range.
Output State: **The list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n.**
