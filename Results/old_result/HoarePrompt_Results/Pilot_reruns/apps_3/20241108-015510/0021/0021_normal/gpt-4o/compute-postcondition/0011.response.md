Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It then calculates the maximum distance between the indices of the numbers 1 and `n` in the list and prints this maximum distance. The function does not accept any parameters and outputs a single integer.**
