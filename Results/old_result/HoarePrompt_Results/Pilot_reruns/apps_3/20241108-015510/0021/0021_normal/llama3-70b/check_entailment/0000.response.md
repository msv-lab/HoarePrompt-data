Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, which aligns with the problem description.
- It correctly calculates the maximum distance between the indices of 1 and `n` in the list, or the distance from the beginning or end of the list, and the minimum distance between the indices of 1 and `n`.
- Finally, it prints the maximum of these calculated distances or the distance from `n` to 1 in the list.
- The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the provided examples.
- The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming the correctness of the code.
