Example Answer:
`max_dist` is assigned the maximum value between `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`. The values of `pos1` and `posn` represent the indices of 1 and n in list `a`, respectively. The value of `n` is fixed between 2 and 100. Therefore, the maximum distance can be calculated based on the positions of 1 and n in the list, or the distance from the beginning or end of the list. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` stores the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` stores the index of n in list `a`, `max_dist` is the maximum distance calculated based on the positions of 1 and n in the list or the distance from the beginning or end of the list**.
