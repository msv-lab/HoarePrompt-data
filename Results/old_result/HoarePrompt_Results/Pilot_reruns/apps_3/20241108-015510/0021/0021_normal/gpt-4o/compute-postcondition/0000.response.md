Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial state mentions that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. The list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n. Since the code snippet does not directly affect the list `a`, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100. The list a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n.**
