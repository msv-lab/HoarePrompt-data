Example Answer:
The code calculates the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist` and then prints the result. The `max_dist` is the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in list `a`, while `min_dist` is the minimum distance. The output state after running the code is the same as the initial state, with updated values for `max_dist` and `min_dist`. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` stores the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` stores the index of n in list `a`, updated values for `max_dist` and `min_dist`.**
