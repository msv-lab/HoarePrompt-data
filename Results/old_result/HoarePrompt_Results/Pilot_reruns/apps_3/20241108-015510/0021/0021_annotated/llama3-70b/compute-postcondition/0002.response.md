Example Answer:
The code searches for the index of the integer 1 in list `a` and assigns it to `pos1`. Since 1 is guaranteed to be present in the list `a`, `pos1` will be the index of 1 in the list. The value of `n` and the elements of list `a` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, and `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`**
