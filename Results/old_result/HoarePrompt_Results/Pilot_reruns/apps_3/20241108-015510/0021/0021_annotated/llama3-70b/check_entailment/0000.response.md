Correctness: True

Explanation: The code correctly implements the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the list, calculating the maximum distance between them after a single swap, and then printing the maximum possible distance. The code considers all possible scenarios and edge cases as described in the problem statement and the annotations. The examples provided in the problem description are covered by the code and produce the expected output.
