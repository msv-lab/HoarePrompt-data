Example Answer:
max_distance is assigned the maximum value among dist1, dist2, dist3, and dist4. The values of dist1, dist2, dist3, and dist4 are calculated based on the initial state variables. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, min_pos is the index of the number 1 in the list a, max_pos is the index of the largest integer in list a, dist1 is the absolute difference between 0 and max_pos, dist2 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and max_pos, dist3 is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos, dist4 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos, and max_distance is the maximum among dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4.
Output State: **n is an input integer, a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, min_pos is the index of the number 1 in the list a, max_pos is the index of the largest integer in list a, dist1 is the absolute difference between 0 and max_pos, dist2 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and max_pos, dist3 is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos, dist4 is the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos, and max_distance is the maximum among dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4**
