Example Answer: 
The list `a` is assigned the values entered through input after converting them to integers using `map` and `split`. The values are distinct integers between 1 and n, where n is between 2 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n**
