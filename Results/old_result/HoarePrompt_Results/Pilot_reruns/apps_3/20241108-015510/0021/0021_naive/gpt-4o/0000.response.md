Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly identifies the minimum and maximum element positions in the array and calculates the distance of each element from the ends of the array. It then determines the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after one swap and outputs the result. The logic provided covers all potential cases and correctly follows the problem description.
