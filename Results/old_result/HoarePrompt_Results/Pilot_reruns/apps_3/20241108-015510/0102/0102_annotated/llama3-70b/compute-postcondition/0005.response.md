Example Answer:
The code accesses the list `teens` at index `s - 10` and prints the value at that index. Since only `s` is given as an input integer, the value of `teens` and the specific value of `s` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: s is an input integer.
Output State: **s is an input integer**
