Example Answer:
The function returns the concatenation of the string at index `n // 10` of the `tens` array, a hyphen, and the string at index `n % 10` of the `ones` array. The value of `n` is calculated as `s`, and since `s` is in the range of 0 to 99, the output state will depend on the values stored in the `tens` and `ones` arrays at the respective indices. 
Output State: **Depends on the values stored in the `tens` and `ones` arrays at the respective indices**
