Example Answer: 
The function returns the concatenation of the string in the 'tens' list at index n // 10 and the string in the 'ones' list at index n % 10, separated by a hyphen. The values of 'ones', 'teens', and 'tens' are not mentioned, but based on the provided initial state, we can assume they contain the appropriate words. Therefore, the output state is: `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` contains words representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` contains strings representing tens from zero to nine, and the function returns the word representation of the given number n in the format 'tens-ones'.
Output State: **`ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine, `teens` contains words representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` contains strings representing tens from zero to nine, and the function returns the word representation of the given number n in the format 'tens-ones'**
