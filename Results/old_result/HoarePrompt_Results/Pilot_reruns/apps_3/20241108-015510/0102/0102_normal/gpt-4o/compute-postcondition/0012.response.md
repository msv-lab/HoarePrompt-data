Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts an integer parameter n and returns the word representation of that number based on specific conditions. If n is between 0 and 9, it returns the word representation from 'zero' to 'nine'. If n is between 11 and 19, it returns the word equivalent from 'eleven' to 'nineteen'. For numbers between 10 and 99, if n is divisible by 10, it returns the word representation of the tens place from 'ten' to 'ninety'. Otherwise, it returns the concatenation of the word representation of the tens place followed by a hyphen and the word representation of the ones place. The function covers all possible cases for converting the given number n to its word representation, including edge cases at the boundaries (0, 9, 11, 19, 20, 99) and ensures correct representation for all two-digit numbers between 10 and 99 inclusively.**
