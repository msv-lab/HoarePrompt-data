Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the k-rounding of n by incrementing n until it is divisible by 10^k. This logic covers all potential cases as it guarantees that the resulting number ends with k or more zeros and is divisible by n. The program will work for all valid inputs as per the problem description.
