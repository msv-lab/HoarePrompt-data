The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, `t` is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route, respectively. 

After executing the function body, if `n` is greater than 0 and `bus_routes` is not empty, the function calculates the minimum wait time among the routes and the index of the route with the minimum wait time. If `n` is 0 or `bus_routes` is an empty list, the function sets the minimum wait time to positive infinity and chosen_route to -1. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept positive integers `n` and `t`, along with a list of tuples `bus_routes`, and calculate the minimum wait time among the routes and the index of the route with the minimum wait time. If there are no bus routes or `n` is 0, it sets the minimum wait time to positive infinity and chosen_route to -1.
