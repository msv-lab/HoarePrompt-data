According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `t` are integers within the specified range, `buses` is a list of length `n+3` after appending the new tuple, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n+1` and `t` are integers within the specified range, `buses` is a list of length `n+4` after appending the new tuple, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
