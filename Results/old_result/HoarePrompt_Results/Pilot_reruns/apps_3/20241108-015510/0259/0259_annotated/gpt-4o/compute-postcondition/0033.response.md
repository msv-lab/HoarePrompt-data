Output State: 
- If n is greater than 0 and bus_routes is not empty, the loop will execute and update min_wait_time with the calculated wait time based on the conditions, and chosen_route with the corresponding route index. The variables i, s_i, d_i, wait_time will be appropriately assigned based on the tuples in bus_routes.
- If n is 0 or bus_routes is an empty list, the loop won't execute and min_wait_time will remain positive infinity, chosen_route will remain -1.
- The loop accurately handles scenarios where s_i is greater than or equal to t, wait_time is set to s_i - t. If (t - s_i) % d_i is 0, wait_time is 0. For other cases, wait_time is calculated as d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i, ensuring proper computation of wait_time for each route.
- The variables are updated within the loop to ensure min_wait_time reflects the minimum wait time among all routes, and chosen_route corresponds to the route with the minimum wait time.
- The loop covers edge cases effectively, ensuring correct calculation and comparison of wait times for each route, providing a reliable output state based on the conditions specified in the code.
- Output State: **If n is greater than 0 and bus_routes is not empty, min_wait_time is the minimum wait time among the routes, chosen_route is the index of the route with the minimum wait time. If n is 0 or bus_routes is an empty list, min_wait_time is positive infinity, chosen_route is -1.**
