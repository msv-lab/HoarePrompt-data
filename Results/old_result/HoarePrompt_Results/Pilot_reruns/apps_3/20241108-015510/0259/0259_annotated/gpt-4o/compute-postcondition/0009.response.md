Example Answer: 
The value of `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The value of `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions mentioned in the initial state, considering the values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the calculated wait time based on the conditions.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is the calculated wait time based on the conditions**
