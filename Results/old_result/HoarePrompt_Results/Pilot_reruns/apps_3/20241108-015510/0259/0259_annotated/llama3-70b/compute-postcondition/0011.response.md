According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n+1` and `t` are integers within the specified range, `buses` is a list of length `n+5`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `s` and `d` are assigned the values of integers obtained by splitting the input. To execute the loop one more time, the loop needs to iterate once more, so `n+1` needs to be incremented. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n+1` and `t` are integers within the specified range, `buses` is a list of length `n+5`, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer, `s` and `d` are assigned the values of integers obtained by splitting the input, `n+1` is one more than the previous value**
