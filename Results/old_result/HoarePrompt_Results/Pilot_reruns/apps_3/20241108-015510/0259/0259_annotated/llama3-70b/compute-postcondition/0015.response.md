According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the buses list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the beginning, the buses list is empty, so it needs to be adjusted to have at least one element to satisfy the loop condition. Additionally, for the loop to execute, the index `i` should be 0, `s` and `d` should be the elements of the first tuple in the buses list. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **buses is a list with at least 1 element, min_time is positive infinity, ans is -1, i is 0, s is the first element of the first tuple in buses, d is the second element of the first tuple in buses**
