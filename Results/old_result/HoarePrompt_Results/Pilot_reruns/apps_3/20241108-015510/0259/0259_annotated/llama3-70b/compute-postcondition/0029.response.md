Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list with at least 3 elements. If the calculated time is less than the current minimum time, `min_time` is updated to be the same as the calculated time, `ans` is updated to be `i + 1`, `i` is incremented, `s` is updated, `d` is updated, and `time` is recalculated based on the values of `t`, `s`, and `d`. This process covers all possible edge cases when updating the variables and ensures the program maintains the necessary conditions after the execution of the if statement.***
