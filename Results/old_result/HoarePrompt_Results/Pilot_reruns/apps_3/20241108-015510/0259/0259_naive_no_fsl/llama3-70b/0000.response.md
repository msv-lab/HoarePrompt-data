Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly reads the input values for the number of bus routes and the time Serval goes to the station. It then iterates through each bus route, calculates the time it takes for the bus to arrive after Serval reaches the station, and keeps track of the route with the minimum time. Finally, it prints the bus route that Serval will take. The logic of the code aligns with the problem description provided. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected for all inputs.
