Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly determines which bus route Serval will use by calculating the minimum waiting time for each bus route and choosing the one with the minimum wait time. The logic for calculating the wait time is also correct based on the problem description. The program iterates through each bus route and calculates the wait time based on the arrival time of the first bus and the interval between buses. The chosen route is then returned as the output. The program reads input from standard input and processes it accordingly. Overall, the program aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for all potential cases.
