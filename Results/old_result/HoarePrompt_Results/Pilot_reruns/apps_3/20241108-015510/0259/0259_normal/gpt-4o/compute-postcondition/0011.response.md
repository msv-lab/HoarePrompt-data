Postcondition: ***`n`, `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of the i-th bus route, `d_i` is the destination of the i-th bus route. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. After the execution of the if block, `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the current `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to the value of `i + 1`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and accurately describes the final state of the program variables.***
