Postcondition: ***`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i`, `s_i`, `d_i` remain unchanged. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. This block accounts for the conditions where the waiting time is less than the minimum wait time, and it appropriately updates the minimum wait time and the chosen route.***
