According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, `d_i` remain unchanged. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to the value of `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`.
State: **`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1`, `s_i`, `d_i` remain unchanged**
