Postcondition: ***`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `i + 1`, `s_i`, `d_i` remain unchanged. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Ensure that the wait time is correctly calculated based on the conditions specified.***
