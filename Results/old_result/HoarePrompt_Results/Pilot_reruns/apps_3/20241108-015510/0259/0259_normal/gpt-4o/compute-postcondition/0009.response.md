Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is set to the value of `wait_time`, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i` is the source of the i-th bus route, `d_i` is the destination of the i-th bus route. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
