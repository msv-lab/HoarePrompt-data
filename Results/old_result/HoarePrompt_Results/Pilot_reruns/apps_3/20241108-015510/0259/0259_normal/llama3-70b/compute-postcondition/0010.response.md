Example Answer:
A tuple (s, d) is created based on user input for s and d, and this tuple is appended to the list buses. The initial state includes n being greater than 0, t having a user-input based value, buses containing two tuples based on user input, s and d being integers based on user input, and _ being 2. After executing the code, the list buses will contain the newly added tuple (s, d).
Output State: **n is greater than 0, t has a user-input based value, buses contains three tuples based on user input, s and d are integers based on user input, _ is 2**
