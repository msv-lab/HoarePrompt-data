Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned the values from the user input after splitting on a space. The values of `s` and `d` are based on the user input. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `t` has a user-input based value, `buses` is an empty list, `s` and `d` are based on user input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` has a user-input based value, `buses` is an empty list, `s` and `d` are based on user input**
