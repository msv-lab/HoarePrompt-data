Example Answer:
The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. The other variables `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: **n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, bus_routes is a list of tuples, and min_wait_time is initialized to positive infinity.**
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes, t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station, bus_routes is a list of tuples, and min_wait_time is initialized to positive infinity**
