According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `_` needs to be adjusted to a value less than `n`, so `_` should be greater than or equal to 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` has a user-input based value, `buses` contains one tuple based on user input, `s` and `d` are based on user input, `_` is 1**
