According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as the value of `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 2 and `n` is greater than 0. Therefore, in order for the loop to execute one more time, `_` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **n is greater than 0, t has a user-input based value, buses contains three tuples based on user input, s and d are integers based on user input, _ is 3**
