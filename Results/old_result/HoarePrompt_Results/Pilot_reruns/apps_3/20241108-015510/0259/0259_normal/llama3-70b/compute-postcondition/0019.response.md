Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `t` has a user-input based value, `buses` contains `n` tuples based on user input, `s` and `d` are integers based on user input, `min_time` is the minimum time value calculated, `ans` is the index of the minimum time plus 1, `i` is 0, and `time` is based on user input values of `t`, `s`, and `d. The program updates `min_time` to the minimum of the current time value and the previous minimum time, and sets `ans` to the index of the minimum time plus 1.***
