The value of `max_pos` is used to calculate `dist1`, which is assigned the absolute difference between `0` and `max_pos`. Since `max_pos` is an index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`, its specific value will determine `dist1`. The calculation does not affect any other variables, so the output state remains focused on the values of `n`, `a`, `max_pos`, and `dist1`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `2 ≤ n ≤ 100`; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is abs(0 - max_pos)**
