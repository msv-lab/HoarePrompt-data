To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze how it handles the requirements outlined in the problem description.

### Problem Breakdown
1. **Input**: An integer `n` (2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a permutation of integers from 1 to n, which is a list of size `n`.
2. **Output**: The maximum possible distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) after performing exactly one swap.

### Code Analysis
The provided code does the following:
1. Reads the integer `n` and the permutation `a`.
2. Finds the positions of the minimum element (`min_pos`) and the maximum element (`max_pos`).
3. Computes the four potential distances:
   - Distance if the maximum element is swapped with the first element (index 0).
   - Distance if the maximum element is swapped with the last element (index n-1).
   - Distance if the minimum element is swapped with the first element (index 0).
   - Distance if the minimum element is swapped with the last element (index n-1).
4. Determines the maximum of these distances and prints it.

### Edge Case Consideration
The code calculates the distances based on swapping the minimum or maximum elements with the ends of the array. However, it does not explicitly check whether this results in the maximum distance achievable by a single swap, as it assumes that swapping with the ends will always yield the maximum distance.

#### Counterexample
Consider the following case:
- Input:
  ```
  5
  2 3 1 4 5
  ```
- Expected maximum distance by swapping:
  - The minimum (1) is at index 2, the maximum (5) is at index 4.
  - The distance is currently 2.
  - A potential swap is to exchange 1 with 2 (new positions: 1 at index 0 and 5 at index 4), yielding a distance of 4.
  
However, the code calculates:
- `dist1` (swap 5 with 2) = `abs(0 - 4)` = 4
- `dist2` (swap 5 with 5) = `abs(4 - 4)` = 0 (not applicable here)
- `dist3` (swap 1 with 2) = `abs(0 - 2)` = 2
- `dist4` (swap 1 with 5) = `abs(4 - 2)` = 2

The maximum distance calculated incorrectly would be 4 because the program does not account for the two valid swaps that could happen in the middle of the list.

### Conclusion
The program does not cover all scenarios for the required logic, specifically it cannot guarantee that it checks all possible swaps and therefore does not always yield the correct maximum distance.

Correctness: **False**
