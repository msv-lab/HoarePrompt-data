The value of `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The values of `a` and the previous state of `n` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to n, with `n` being an input integer.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is in the range from 1 to n**
