To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze it against the problem description and the output hints.

### Problem Description Summary:
- We are given a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n.
- The goal is to maximize the distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) by performing exactly one swap.

### Program Analysis:
The program proceeds as follows:
1. It reads the integer `n` and the list `a` of integers.
2. It finds the positions of `1` (minimum element) and `n` (maximum element) in the list.
3. It calculates the distances from both ends of the list (index 0 and index n-1) to the positions of `1` and `n`.
4. It then determines the maximum of these distances and prints it.

### Output Hints Summary:
The output hints describe that the function calculates the maximum distance from either end of the list to the positions of `1` and `n`, and prints this maximum distance. The hints also state that the function does not validate the input, assuming it adheres to the constraints specified.

### Key Observations:
- The code effectively calculates the distances from both ends of the array to the positions of `1` and `n`. However, it only considers distances to the ends, and not the effect of performing a swap to maximize the distance after the swap itself.
- For instance, if `1` is at index 0 and `n` is at index n-1, the distance is already maximized at `n-1`, but the swap logic does not lead to a correct conclusion about the maximum distance after a swap.
- The calculation does not consider the specific elements that could be swapped to achieve the maximum distance. 

### Edge Case Consideration:
Consider the case where:
- Input: `n = 2`, `a = [2, 1]`. 
- The code would calculate the distances as follows:
  - `min_pos = 1` and `max_pos = 0`
  - Distances would be calculated as `dist1 = abs(0 - 0) = 0`, `dist2 = abs(1 - 0) = 1`, `dist3 = abs(0 - 1) = 1`, `dist4 = abs(1 - 1) = 0`. 
  - The maximum distance calculated is `1`, which is correct since the only swap leads to a distance of 1.

However, for a case like:
- Input: `n = 5`, `a = [1, 5, 3, 4, 2]`. 
- The code would not adequately explore the swap possibilities, as it merely calculates the distances from the ends without confirming if a swap could yield a greater distance.

### Conclusion:
The program does not handle all scenarios where a swap can yield a larger distance correctly. It only evaluates based on the current positions and does not account for the optimal swap operation needed to achieve maximum distance.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to meet the requirement of maximizing the distance through an appropriate swap and does not cover all potential cases effectively.
