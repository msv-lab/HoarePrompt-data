Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `pos1` is the index of 1 in `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`; `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); `min_dist` is calculated as min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2); the printed output is max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist)**
