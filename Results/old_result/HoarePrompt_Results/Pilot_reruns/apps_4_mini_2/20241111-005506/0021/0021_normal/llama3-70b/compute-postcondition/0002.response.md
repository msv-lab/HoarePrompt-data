The code assigns the value of `pos1` to be the index of the integer `1` in the list `a`. Since `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers inputted by the user, it is guaranteed that the integer `1` is present in the list `a`.

Thus, `pos1` will be assigned the index of `1` within the list `a`. The output state will reflect the current values of `n`, `a`, and the newly assigned `pos1`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers inputted from user input, and `pos1` is the index of 1 in `a`.**
