The code prints the value of `max_distance`. Since the initial state indicates that `max_distance` is derived from the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`, the output state will reflect the current values of these variables. However, since their values are not provided, we can only state that `max_distance` will be printed. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `dist2` is abs(`n` - 1 - `max_pos`); `max_distance` is max(`dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, `dist4`) and the value of `max_distance` is printed.**
