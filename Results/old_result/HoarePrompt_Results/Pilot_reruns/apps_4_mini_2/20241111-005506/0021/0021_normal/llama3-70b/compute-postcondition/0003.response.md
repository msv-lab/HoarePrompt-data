The variable `posn` is assigned the value of `a.index(n)`, which finds the index of the value `n` in the list `a`. The value of `n` is an input integer within the range of 2 to 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers. It is assumed that `n` is present in the list `a`. The other variables `n`, `a`, and `pos1` are not affected by this operation.

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in `a`, and `posn` is the index of `n` in `a`.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `pos1` is the index of 1 in `a`, and `posn` is the index of `n` in `a**.
