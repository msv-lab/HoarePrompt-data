The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The other variable `a` remains unchanged since it is not affected by this line of code. The output state indicates that `n` will be an integer in the range of 2 to 100 based on the input provided. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is in the range 1 to n**
