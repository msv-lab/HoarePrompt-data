In the provided code snippet, `dist1` is assigned the value of the absolute difference between `0` and `max_pos`. Since `max_pos` is the index of `n` in the list `a`, we do not have a specific value for `max_pos`, but it will be an integer representing the position of `n` in that list. 

The output state is affected by the assignment of `dist1`, which calculates the distance from position `0` to `max_pos`. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the variables that are directly impacted by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers; `min_pos` is the index of 1 in the list `a`; `max_pos` is the index of n in the list `a`; `dist1` is abs(0 - max_pos)**
