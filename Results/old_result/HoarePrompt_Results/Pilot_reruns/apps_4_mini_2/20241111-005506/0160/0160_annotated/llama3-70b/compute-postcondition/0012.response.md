According to the code, the loop is set to execute for `i` values starting from 1 up to the integer value of the square root of `gcd`. For the loop to execute at least once, `gcd` must be greater than or equal to 1 because the square root of a non-positive number does not yield a valid range for the loop.

From the provided state:
- `gcd` must be at least 1.
- `i` is initialized as `N-1`, but it will be re-assigned at the start of the loop.

Thus, we need to ensure that `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1. The initial value of `i` does not affect the execution of the loop as it will be set to 1 when the loop starts.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
