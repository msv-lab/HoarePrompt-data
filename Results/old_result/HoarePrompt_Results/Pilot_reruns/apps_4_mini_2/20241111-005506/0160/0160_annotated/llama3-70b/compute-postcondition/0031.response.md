Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, N (between 2 and 500) and K (a non-negative integer up to 10^9), along with a list A of N integers (each between 1 and 10^6). It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the integers in A, finds the largest divisor of this gcd, and prints that value. The function does not return any value. **
