The code adds the value of `x // i` to the set `divisors`. The variable `i` is currently 1, so `x // i` simplifies to `x // 1`, which is equal to `x`. Since `divisors` already contains the value 1, it will now also include the value of `x`. The state of the other variables remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is now {1, x}, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1.
