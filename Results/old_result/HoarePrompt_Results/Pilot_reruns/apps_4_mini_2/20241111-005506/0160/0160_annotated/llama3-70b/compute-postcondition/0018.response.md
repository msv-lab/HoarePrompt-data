The `max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between its current value and `i`, where `i` is 2. The initial state specifies that `max_divisor` remains unchanged. Therefore, the final value of `max_divisor` depends on its initial value compared to 2. The output state indicates that `max_divisor` can either remain the same or be updated to 2, depending on whether its initial value is less than 2.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `max_divisor` is either unchanged or updated based on its comparison with 2**
