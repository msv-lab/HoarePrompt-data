Postcondition: ***`gcd` is greater than 4 and `i` is 3. If `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. Additionally, if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum of its current value and the integer division of `gcd` by `i`. If `gcd` is not divisible by `i`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
