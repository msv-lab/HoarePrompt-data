Postcondition: ***If `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1, and if `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `i`. Additionally, if `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, then `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
