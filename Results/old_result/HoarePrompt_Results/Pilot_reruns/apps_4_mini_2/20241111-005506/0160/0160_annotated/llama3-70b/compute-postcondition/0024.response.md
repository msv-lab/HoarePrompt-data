The value of `max_divisor` is updated to be the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd // i`. Since `gcd` is greater than 4 and `i` is 3, `gcd // i` will be a positive integer. However, the exact value of `gcd` is not specified, so the exact value of `max_divisor` cannot be determined. The previous value of `max_divisor` remains unchanged in the calculation for the new value. Therefore, the output state is: `gcd` is greater than 4, `i` is 3, and `max_divisor` is updated based on the comparison with `gcd // i`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than 4, `i` is 3, and `max_divisor` is updated based on the comparison with `gcd // i**
