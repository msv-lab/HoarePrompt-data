The code adds the value of `i` to the `divisors` set. The value of `i` is currently 1, and since `divisors` is initially an empty set, after executing the code, `divisors` will contain the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is now {1}, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6, `divisors` is now {1}, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**.
