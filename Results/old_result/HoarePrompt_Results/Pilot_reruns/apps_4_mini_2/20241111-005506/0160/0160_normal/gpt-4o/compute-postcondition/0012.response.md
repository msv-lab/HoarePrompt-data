Postcondition: ***`N` is an integer between 2 and 500; `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer `A[i]` is between 1 and 10^6; `K` is a non-negative integer not exceeding 10^9; `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x))`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, the set `divisors` now includes both the value of `i` and the value of `x // i`. If `x` is a perfect square, `divisors` will include `i` only once. If `x` is less than `i * i`, no changes are made to `divisors`.***
