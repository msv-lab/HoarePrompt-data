To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we analyze the provided information:

1. The loop iterates over `i` starting from 1 up to `N-1` (inclusive), as indicated by `range(1, N)`.
2. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, which means the loop has executed once and `i` will be incremented to 2 for the next iteration.
3. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than `N`. Since `i` is currently 1 and `N` is between 2 and 500, the loop can execute again because `1 < N`.
4. As `i` will increment to 2, we need to update `i` to reflect this change. Additionally, `gcd` needs to be updated based on the new value of `i`.

Thus, we have the following updates:
- `i` will be updated to 2.
- `gcd` will be updated to `math.gcd(gcd, A[2])` since it now references the element at index 2 of the list `A`.

No other states need to be adjusted since `N` remains unchanged and has the same constraints.

State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `gcd` is updated to math.gcd(gcd, A[2]), `i` is 2**
