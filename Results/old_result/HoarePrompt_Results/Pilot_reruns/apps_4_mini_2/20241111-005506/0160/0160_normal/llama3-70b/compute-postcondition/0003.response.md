According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `N`. The loop starts at `i = 1` and continues until `i < N`, meaning the loop will execute if `N` is at least 2. Since `N` is specified to be an integer between 2 and 500, it is guaranteed to be valid for the loop to execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `gcd` is initialized to `A[0]`, and `A` is a list with `N` integers.

For the loop to be executed, `i` must start at 1, and `gcd` will be the value of `A[0]`. 

State: **`N` is between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `gcd` is `A[0]`, `i` is 1**
