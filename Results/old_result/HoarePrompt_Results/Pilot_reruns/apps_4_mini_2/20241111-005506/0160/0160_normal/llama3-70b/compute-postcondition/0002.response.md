The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `A`, which is `A[0]`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state reflects the initial values of `N`, `K`, and the list `A`, along with the assigned value of `gcd`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers from input, `gcd` is `A[0]`**
