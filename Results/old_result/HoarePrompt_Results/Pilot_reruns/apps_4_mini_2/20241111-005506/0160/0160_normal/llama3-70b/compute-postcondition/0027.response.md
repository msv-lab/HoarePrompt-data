According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` in relation to the value of `gcd`. The loop iterates while `i` is in the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 9, `int(math.sqrt(gcd))` is at least 3 (as the square root of 9 is 3). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4.

Since `gcd` is still stated to be greater than or equal to 9, no other adjustments need to be made to its state.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 4**
