The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. Since `s` and `d` are already assigned input integers, the state of the `buses` list will be modified to include the new tuple. The values of `n`, `t`, and `_` are not affected by this operation, and the previous state of `buses` is not specified, so it remains unchanged except for the addition of the new element. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `_` is incremented by 1, and `buses` contains all previous tuples plus the new tuple (s, d)**
