The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of positive infinity (`float('inf')`). This indicates that it is initialized to the largest possible value, which is useful for finding a minimum value later. The other variables (`n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of those variables along with the new value of `min_wait_time`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000, and `min_wait_time` is float('inf')**.
