The code initializes an empty list `buses`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed since `buses` is being created anew, and the state of `n` and `t` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000; `buses` is an empty list.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000; `buses` is an empty list**
