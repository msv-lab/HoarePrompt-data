Postcondition: ***`buses` is a list containing at least 1 tuple; `i` is less than the length of `buses`; `time` is assigned the value `(t - s) % d`. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is set to `i + 1`. If `time` is greater than or equal to `min_time`, then `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged.***
