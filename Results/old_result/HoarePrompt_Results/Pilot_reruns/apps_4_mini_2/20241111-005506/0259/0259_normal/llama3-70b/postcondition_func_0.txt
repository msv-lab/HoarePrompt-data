The function accepts two positive integers `n` and `t`, where `n` represents the number of buses and `t` represents the current time. It then collects `n` pairs of integers representing the start time `s` and the duration `d` for each bus. The function calculates the minimum waiting time for the next bus after time `t`, and returns the 1-based index of the bus with the shortest waiting time. If no buses are provided (i.e., if `n` is 0), the function will print `-1`, indicating that no buses are available.
