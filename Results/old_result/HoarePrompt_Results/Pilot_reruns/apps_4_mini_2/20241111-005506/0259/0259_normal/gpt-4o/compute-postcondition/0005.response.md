The variable `wait_time` is initialized to 0. The previous values of the affected variables remain unchanged, as this assignment does not alter them. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[0]`, and `wait_time` is 0**.
