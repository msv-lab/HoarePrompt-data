To analyze the given code snippet, let's break down the components:

1. **Initial State Variables:**
   - `n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 100) and greater than `i + 1`.
   - `t` is a positive integer (1 <= `t` <= 100000).
   - `bus_routes` is a list of tuples (we do not have specific values, but we assume it has been populated).
   - `min_wait_time` is initialized as `float('inf')`.
   - `chosen_route` is initialized to -1.
   - `i` is incremented by 1 (`i = i + 1`).
   - `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[i]`, meaning `s_i` is the first element and `d_i` is the second element of the tuple at index `i` in `bus_routes`.

2. **Calculation:**
   - The calculation for `wait_time` is based on `s_i` and `d_i` values that have been assigned from `bus_routes[i]`.
   - The formula for `wait_time` is `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.

3. **Impact of the Code:**
   - The value of `wait_time` is computed based on the values of `s_i` and `d_i` obtained from `bus_routes`.
   - The state of other variables remains unchanged except for the calculated `wait_time`.

Since we do not have specific values for `s_i`, `d_i`, and `wait_time`, we acknowledge that `wait_time` is derived from those variables. 

Therefore, the output state, acknowledging the calculations that took place, is:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= `n` <= 100) and greater than `i + 1`; `t` is a positive integer (1 <= `t` <= 100000); `bus_routes` is a list of tuples; `min_wait_time` is float('inf'); `chosen_route` is -1; `i` is incremented by 1; `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from `bus_routes[i]`; `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
