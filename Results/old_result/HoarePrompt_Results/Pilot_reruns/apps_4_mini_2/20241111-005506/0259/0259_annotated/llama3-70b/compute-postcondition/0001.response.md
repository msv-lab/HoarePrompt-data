The variable `buses` is assigned an empty list. The initial values of `n` and `t` are not affected by this assignment, and their values remain as positive integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `n` and `t`, along with the new state of `buses`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `buses` is an empty list**
