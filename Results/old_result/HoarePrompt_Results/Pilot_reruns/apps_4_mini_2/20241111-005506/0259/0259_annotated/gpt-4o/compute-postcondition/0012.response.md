According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its last value, which would be `n - 1` (since the loop starts at 0). 

To allow the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to `n`, which means that the loop will not execute again because the condition `i < n` will no longer hold true. Therefore, we need to adjust the state by updating `i` to `n` to indicate that the loop has completed its iterations.

No other states need to be adjusted as the conditions for `n` and the other variables do not change with respect to the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (`s_i`, `d_i`), `wait_time` is calculated as described, `min_wait_time` is updated accordingly, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1, i is n`**
