According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, as long as `n` is a positive integer. Given that `n` is already defined as a positive integer within the range of 1 to 100, the loop is guaranteed to execute at least once. 

Since the loop variable is not used in the loop body, it does not affect the state outside the loop. The variables `t` and `buses` do not influence the execution of the loop either. However, since `buses` is an empty list, it is essential to note that the list does not hold any data before the loop starts.

Thus, the necessary states to be adjusted for the loop to execute are mainly to confirm the existing state of `n`, while noting that `t` and `buses` do not hinder the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` is an empty list**
