According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as the number of iterations (denoted by `n`) has not yet been exhausted. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100. Since the loop runs for `n` iterations, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to reflect that one iteration has completed.

Thus, `n` must be decreased by 1. No other states need to be adjusted since the other variables (`t` and `buses`) do not affect the execution of the loop.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 99, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` contains two tuples: the original tuple and the new tuple `(s, d)`**
