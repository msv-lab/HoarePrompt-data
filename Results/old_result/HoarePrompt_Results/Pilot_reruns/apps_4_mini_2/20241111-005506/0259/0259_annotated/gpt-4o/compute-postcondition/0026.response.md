The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value calculated from the expression `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are taken from `bus_routes[n]`, but the specific values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t` are not provided in the initial state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `wait_time` is calculated based on the formula, but the specific result cannot be determined without knowing the exact values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`.

Output State: **`s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[n]`; `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
