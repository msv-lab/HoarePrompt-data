The code takes input from the user, which is then split into two parts and converted to integers. The variables `s` and `d` will now hold these two integer values derived from the user input. The previous values of `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this code. Therefore, the output state will reflect the assignment of `s` and `d` based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 99, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, `buses` contains two tuples: the original tuple and the new tuple `(s, d)` assigned from user input.**
