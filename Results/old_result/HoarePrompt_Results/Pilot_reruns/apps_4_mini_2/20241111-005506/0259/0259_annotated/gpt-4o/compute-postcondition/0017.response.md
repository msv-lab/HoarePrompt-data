Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000, and `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (`s_i`, `d_i`). If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, the wait_time is 0, indicating that the bus is at the stop when `t` is checked. Otherwise, the wait_time is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, which represents the time until the next bus arrives after `t` has been checked. This ensures that wait_time is always a non-negative integer since it accounts for the bus schedule based on the current time `t` and the bus route parameters `s_i` and `d_i`.***
