To derive the output state, we will analyze the provided code snippet based on the initial state of the variables.

1. **Understanding the Variables**:
   - `n` is a positive integer within the range [1, 100].
   - `t` is a positive integer within the range [1, 100000].
   - `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers: `s_i` (start of the bus route) and `d_i` (destination of the bus route).

2. **Understanding the Code**:
   - The expression `wait_time = d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` calculates the wait time for a specific bus route.
   - Here, `s_i` and `d_i` are specific values from the `n`-th tuple in the `bus_routes` list.

3. **Calculating `wait_time`**:
   - `t - s_i` gives the time that has passed since the start of the bus route.
   - The modulo operation `(t - s_i) % d_i` determines how much time has elapsed since the last bus departed.
   - Subtracting this value from `d_i` gives the wait time until the next bus arrives.

4. **Impact on the Program**:
   - The variable `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. However, the specific values of `s_i` and `d_i` are not provided in the initial state description.

Since we cannot determine the exact numerical output of `wait_time` without the actual values of `s_i` and `d_i`, we can only state how `wait_time` is defined relative to the input variables.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `n` <= 100; `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= `t` <= 100000; `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (`s_i`, `d_i`); `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
