The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value `-1`. This does not affect any of the other variables (`n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`), so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is set to infinity, and `chosen_route` is -1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 <= n <= 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 100000, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers (s_i, d_i) such that 1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000, `min_wait_time` is set to infinity, and `chosen_route` is -1**.
