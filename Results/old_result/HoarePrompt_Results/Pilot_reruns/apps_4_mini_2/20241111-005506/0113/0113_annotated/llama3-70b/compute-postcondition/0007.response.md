According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `x`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `n % x` is not equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 4 and 10^9 + 3, and `x` is greater than the new value of `n`. 

Given that `x` is greater than `n`, the expression `n % x` will always evaluate to `n` (since `n` is less than `x`), which means that `n % x` is not equal to 0. Therefore, the loop can execute again without needing any adjustments to the state.

State: **`n` is a positive integer from 4 to 10^9 + 3, `x` is greater than the new value of `n`**
