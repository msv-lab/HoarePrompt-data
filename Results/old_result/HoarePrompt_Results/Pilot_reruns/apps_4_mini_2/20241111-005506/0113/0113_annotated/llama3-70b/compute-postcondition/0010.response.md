The function `func` does not accept any parameters as indicated by its definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` is a positive integer within the range of 1 to \(10^9\) and `k` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 8. 

Since the function's output is not specified in the provided information, we cannot detail specific return values or conditions. Therefore, we can only state the functionality based on the parameters that are implied to be used.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters but operates with the constraints that n is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and k is a non-negative integer (0 ≤ k ≤ 8). The specific return value is not detailed.**
