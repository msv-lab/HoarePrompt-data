Output State: **`if n is a positive integer not divisible by 10 then n` will be incremented until it becomes the next integer that is divisible by 10, and `n` will be equal to the smallest integer greater than or equal to the input `n` that is divisible by 10. if n is already divisible by 10 then the loop does not execute and `n` remains the same, while `k` is a non-negative integer and `x` is 10.**
