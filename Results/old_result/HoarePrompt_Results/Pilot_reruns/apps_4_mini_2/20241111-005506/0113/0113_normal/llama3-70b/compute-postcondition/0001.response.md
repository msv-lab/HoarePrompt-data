The variable `x` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, which is 10 raised to the power of `k`. The value of `k` can be any non-negative integer, so `x` will be a positive integer that depends on the value of `k`. The variable `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input non-negative integer, and `x` is `10 ** k`.

Output State: **`n` is an input positive integer, `k` is an input non-negative integer, and `x` is `10 ** k`**
