Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `s` (0 ≤ s ≤ 99) and prints its English word representation. If `s` is less than 10, it prints 'one' to 'nine' or an empty string for 0. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints 'ten' to 'nineteen'. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the tens place followed by the ones place, formatted as 'tens' followed by 'ones' with a hyphen if the ones place is not zero. The function does not return any value; it only prints the output. There is no error handling for inputs outside the specified range, which could lead to incorrect behavior if such inputs are provided.**
