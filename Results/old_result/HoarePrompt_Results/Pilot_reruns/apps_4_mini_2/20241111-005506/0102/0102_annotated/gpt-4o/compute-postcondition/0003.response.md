The function returns `ones[n]`, where `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from 0 to 9. The value of `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99, and the function returns the corresponding string from the `ones` list based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99, and the function returns `ones[n]`**
