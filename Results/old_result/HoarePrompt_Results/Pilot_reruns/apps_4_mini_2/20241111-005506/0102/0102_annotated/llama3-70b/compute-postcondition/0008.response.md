Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the corresponding word from the `ones` list which is either an empty string for `s=0` or a string representation for numbers 1 to 9 based on the value of `s`. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the corresponding word from the `teens` list. If `s` is 20 or greater, it prints the string representation of `s` in English, formatted as 'tens' followed by 'ones' with a hyphen if the ones place is not zero. All possible values of `s` within the specified range are handled appropriately.***
