Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is between 10 and 99 inclusive, and a multiple of 10, the function returns the corresponding value from `tens[n // 10]`. If `n` is between 10 and 99 inclusive but not a multiple of 10, the function returns a string combining the value from `tens[n // 10]` and the value from `ones[n % 10]`, separated by a hyphen. Additionally, if `n` is 0, the function would return 'zero', and for the specific cases of 10 and 20, it returns 'ten' and 'twenty', respectively, though these cases are not explicitly handled in the current code fragment.***
