Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly converts an integer score between 0 and 99 into its English word representation, adhering to the problem description's requirements. The annotations clarify the logic used in the function, highlighting how it handles each range of numbers.

1. **Handling Numbers 0-9**: The program correctly returns the words for single-digit numbers by indexing the `ones` list. For example, an input of `6` returns `'six'`.

2. **Handling Numbers 11-19**: The function properly addresses the "teens" by using the `teens` list for numbers from 11 to 19. For example, an input of `15` returns `'fifteen'`.

3. **Handling Multiples of Ten (10, 20, ..., 90)**: The program correctly returns the words for multiples of ten (like `10` and `20`) using the `tens` list. For instance, an input of `20` returns `'twenty'`.

4. **Handling Other Numbers (10-99)**: For numbers that are not multiples of ten between 10 and 99, the function concatenates the appropriate values from the `tens` and `ones` lists, separated by a hyphen. For example, an input of `23` correctly outputs `'twenty-three'`.

5. **Edge Cases**: The program also handles edge cases such as `0`, which returns `'zero'`. The annotations confirm that `0`, `10`, and `20` are correctly accounted for in the logic.

Overall, the program covers all specified cases in the problem description, and the annotations confirm that the logic is sound and comprehensive for the entire range of inputs. Therefore, I conclude that the program meets the correctness criteria outlined in the problem description.

In summary, since the program correctly translates all integers from 0 to 99 into their corresponding English words without omitting any cases, the correctness is affirmed as **True**.
