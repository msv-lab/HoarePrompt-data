Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 99. If `n` is between 0 and 9 inclusive, the function returns the corresponding value from the `ones` list. If `n` is between 11 and 19 inclusive, the function returns the corresponding value from the `teens` list. If `n` is 10 or a multiple of 10 in the range of 10 to 99, the function returns the corresponding value from the `tens` list. If `n` is between 10 and 99 inclusive but not a multiple of 10, the function returns a string combining the value from the `tens` list and the value from the `ones` list, separated by a hyphen. Additionally, if `n` is 0, the function correctly returns 'zero', which is handled in the first case of the if statement.***
