The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it is constrained by the integer `s`, which must satisfy the condition 0 ≤ s ≤ 99. The output of the function is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the return value based on the given constraints. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and is constrained by an integer s such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, but the return value is not specified.**
