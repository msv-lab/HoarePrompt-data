To analyze the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the implementation.

**Problem Description:**
- Convert an integer score (0 ≤ s ≤ 99) into its English word representation.
- The output must consist solely of lowercase English letters and hyphens, with no spaces.

**Program Implementation:**
The function `func_1(n)` is designed to convert numbers into words based on the following logic:
1. It has lists for `ones`, `teens`, and `tens` to handle different ranges of numbers.
2. It checks if the number falls into the `0-9` range, the `11-19` range, or the `10-99` range.
3. It correctly concatenates the appropriate strings for numbers that are not multiples of ten, using a hyphen where necessary.

**Potential Cases:**
1. **Single-digit Numbers (0 to 9)**: The function returns correctly as it directly maps each number to the corresponding word in the `ones` list.
2. **Teens (11 to 19)**: The function handles the teen numbers correctly by referencing the `teens` list. However, it misses the number `10`, which is checked in the `elif` statement but is not handled correctly as it falls through to the tens check.
3. **Multiples of Ten (10, 20, 30, ..., 90)**: The function correctly returns the respective words for these numbers using the `tens` list.
4. **Non-multiples of Ten (like 21, 22, ..., 29)**: The function concatenates the appropriate words from the `tens` and `ones` lists, using a hyphen.

**Identified Issue:**
The function does not handle the number `10` correctly. It falls through the checks and does not return a value when `n` is `10`, which leads to a potential case where the function does not return any string for the input `10`. According to the problem description, the output for `10` should be "ten".

Thus, the following input case demonstrates the issue:
- Input: `10`
- Expected Output: `"ten"`
- Actual Behavior: The function does not return anything for this input.

**Conclusion:**
Since the program does not handle the input `10` correctly, it does not fulfill the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **False**.
