Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly converts an integer score between 0 and 99 into its English word representation, as described in the problem statement. 

1. For numbers from 0 to 9, it uses the `ones` list to return the correct word.
2. For numbers from 10 to 19, it uses the `teens` list to return the correct word.
3. For numbers from 20 to 99, it correctly combines the appropriate word from the `tens` list with the word from the `ones` list, separated by a hyphen when needed, ensuring that the formatting matches the requirements.

The program handles all edge cases specified in the problem description, including:
- The lower bound of the input (0, which outputs an empty string).
- The maximum score of 99, which outputs "ninety-nine".
- Handling numbers that end in 0 correctly (like 20, which outputs "twenty").

Overall, all potential inputs within the specified range produce the expected outputs, confirming the correctness of the program.
