Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where `n` represents the number of days (with a value from 1 to 10^18) and `k` represents the number of iterations (with a value from 2 to 10^18). It calculates the numerator as the product of the first `k` terms starting from `2^n` down to `2^n - (k-1)`, and the denominator as `2^n` raised to the power of `k`. The function then reduces both the numerator and denominator by their greatest common divisor (gcd) and returns the results of both, modulo `10^6 + 3`. If `k` is less than 2, the numerator and denominator remain 1, leading to a return of 1, 1. **
