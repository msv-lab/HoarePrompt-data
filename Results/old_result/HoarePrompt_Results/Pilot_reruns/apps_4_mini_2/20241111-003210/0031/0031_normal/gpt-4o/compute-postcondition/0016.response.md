According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and since `k` is greater than or equal to 2, we need to check the conditions for `i` to be less than `k`. 

To allow for one more iteration, `i` should be incremented to 3. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `k` is greater than 3. 

No other states need to be adjusted. 

State: **`denominator` is updated to `denominator * (2^n) % MOD`, `total_days` is `2^n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (2^n - 2) % MOD`, `k` is greater than 3, `i` is 3**
