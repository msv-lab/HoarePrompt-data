The function encounters a return statement, which means it exits and does not change any variable states. The previously defined variables `n`, `k`, and `MOD` remain unchanged. The function also prints (1, 1) but that is not affected by the return. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variable states along with the return action.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and the function returns**
