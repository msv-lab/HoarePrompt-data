The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days` and taking the result modulo `MOD`. The `total_days` is given as \(2^n\). Therefore, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * (2^n) % MOD`.

The values of `numerator`, `i`, and `k` are not affected by this operation. The output state reflects the updated value of `denominator` while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is updated to `new_numerator`, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * (2^n) % MOD`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 2**
