The value of `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. Since `total_days` is 2, the new value of `denominator` will be `denominator * 2`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `k`, `i`, and `numerator`) are not affected by this operation. 

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18; `k` is at least 2; `i` is 2; `total_days` is 2; `numerator` is multiplied by 0; `denominator` is multiplied by 2**
