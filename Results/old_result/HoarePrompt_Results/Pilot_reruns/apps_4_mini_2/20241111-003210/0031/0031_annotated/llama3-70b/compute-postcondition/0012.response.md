According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is at least 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3 and it must still be less than `k`. Therefore, `k` must be at least 4.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18; `k` is at least 4; `i` is 3; `total_days` is 2; `numerator` is multiplied by 0; `denominator` is multiplied by 2**
