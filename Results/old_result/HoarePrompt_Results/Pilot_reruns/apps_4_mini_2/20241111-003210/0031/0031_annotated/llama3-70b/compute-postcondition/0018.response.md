The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers with the constraints that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18` and `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`. After executing the function body, it calculates a value based on `denominator` divided by `gcd`, and the function returns `numerator % (10`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return a computed value based on the division and modulo operation involving these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n and k, both integers, and returns a computed value derived from the division of a denominator by the gcd and then taking the modulo with 10.**
