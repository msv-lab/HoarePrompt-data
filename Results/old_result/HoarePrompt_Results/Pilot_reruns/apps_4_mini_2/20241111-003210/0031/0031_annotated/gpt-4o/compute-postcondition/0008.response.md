The `numerator` is assigned the value of `numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`. The previous value of `numerator` is 1, `total_days` is \(2^n\), and `i` is 0. Therefore, the calculation for the new value of `numerator` is as follows:

1. Calculate `total_days - i`: \(2^n - 0 = 2^n\).
2. Update `numerator`: \(1 * (2^n) \mod 1000003 = 2^n \mod 1000003\).

Since `n` is an integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{18}\), the exact value of `2^n \mod 1000003` will vary depending on the specific value of `n`. However, the impact of the code is clear:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is \(2^n\), `numerator` is \(2^n \mod 1000003\), `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0**.
