Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`, and `i` is 2. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement without changing `r`.***
