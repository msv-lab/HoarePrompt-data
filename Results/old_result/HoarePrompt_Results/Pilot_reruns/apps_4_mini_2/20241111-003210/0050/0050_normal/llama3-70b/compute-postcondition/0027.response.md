Postcondition: ***`shares` is 0, `m` is greater than 0, and `r` is greater than or equal to `s[0]`. If `shares` were greater than 0, `r` would be increased by `shares * b[i]` and `shares` would be set to 0. However, since `shares` is 0, the execution results in breaking out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
