The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input split by spaces. This means that `b` will contain a list of integers that are provided as input. The initial states of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` are not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that `b` is now a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are integers within the specified ranges; `s` is a list of integers created from the input; `b` is a list of integers from input.**
