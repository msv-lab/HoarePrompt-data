Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are integers, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of that division, and `total_bourles` is calculated as the product of `max_shares` and `max_sell_price` plus `remaining_bourles`, which the function then prints. This handles cases where `min_buy_price` or `max_sell_price` could be zero or negative, ensuring that the calculations are valid and that the program behaves correctly for all input scenarios.***
