The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over a new input string that consists of space-separated values. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unaffected because this operation only impacts `b`. Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s`, along with the new list `b` created from input values.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `m` is an input integer, `r` is an input integer, `s` is a list of integers created from input values, and `b` is a list of integers from the new input values**.
