Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is defined, `s` has at least `n` elements, and `i` is the next index (i + 1). If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by `shares * b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is less than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
