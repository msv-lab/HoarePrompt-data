The variables `x` and `y` are assigned new values from the input after being processed by `map(int, input().split())`, which means they will take integer values from user input. The previous constraints (3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000) still apply, but their specific values will change based on the input provided. Therefore, the output state is: `x` and `y` are updated to new integer values based on input, while maintaining the condition that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are updated to new integer values based on input, while maintaining the condition that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
