The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraints that `x` and `y` are integers such that \(3 \leq y < x \leq 100,000\). After executing the function body, the specific output or behavior is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, since we do not have any information regarding the output of the function, we cannot determine its functionality. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and its output is not specified.**
