Correctness: **False**

The provided program computes the absolute difference between the starting side length \( x \) and the desired side length \( y \) using the expression `abs(x - y)`. However, this does not account for the necessary operations to ensure that the triangle remains non-degenerate while reducing the side lengths.

For instance, consider the input case \( x = 6 \) and \( y = 3 \). The program would output `3`, which is incorrect. The correct sequence of operations to reach from \( (6, 6, 6) \) to \( (3, 3, 3) \) requires four steps:
1. \( (6, 6, 6) \) → \( (6, 6, 3) \)
2. \( (6, 6, 3) \) → \( (6, 4, 3) \)
3. \( (6, 4, 3) \) → \( (3, 4, 3) \)
4. \( (3, 4, 3) \) → \( (3, 3, 3) \)

Thus, the minimum number of seconds required is actually 4, not 3. The program fails to consider the requirement to keep the triangle non-degenerate during the modifications, leading to an incorrect result. Therefore, the program does not meet the problem's requirements for all potential cases.
