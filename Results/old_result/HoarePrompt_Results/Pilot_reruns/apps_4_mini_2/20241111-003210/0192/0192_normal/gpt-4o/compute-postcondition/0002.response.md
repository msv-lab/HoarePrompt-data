The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly, as indicated by the empty parentheses. However, it operates on the integers `x` and `y` which are constrained such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function's output is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value without additional details.

Functionality: **The function has no input parameters and operates on integers x and y, constrained by 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The return value is not specified.**
