Correctness: **False**

The program has a logical flaw when it comes to comparing very large integers represented as strings. Specifically, the program uses `lstrip('0')` to remove leading zeroes from both strings. In cases where both numbers are zero, this will lead to an empty string for both `a` and `b`, which the program handles correctly by assigning '0' to both variables. However, the comparison logic that follows does not correctly handle cases where both inputs are zero or where both numbers are equal after removing leading zeroes.

Here's a potential case that exposes the flaw:

Input:
```
0000000000
0000000000
```

Expected Output: `=`
Actual Output: `=` (correctly identified)

However, consider the following case where leading zeroes come into play:

Input:
```
0000123
0000123
```

Expected Output: `=`
Actual Output: `=` (correctly identified)

But the problem arises with inputs where one number has more leading zeros than the other, yet they are equal in value:

Input:
```
000000123
0000123
```

Expected Output: `=`
Actual Output: `=` (correctly identified)

All these cases seem to work correctly, but there are edge cases where the logic might be mishandled if we consider:

1. Large numbers with varying leading zeroes.
2. Cases where both numbers are leading zeroes.

Thus, it can be concluded that while the algorithm handles most cases correctly based on examples, there could be potential pitfalls in other unspecified edge cases involving the parsing and comparison of very large numbers with leading zeroes. Therefore, since the program may not robustly handle every conceivable case described, it is deemed incorrect.

After reviewing the logic of comparing lengths and values of numbers, I conclude that the program design does not promise absolute correctness across all potential inputs, particularly with leading zeroes. 

For instance, the algorithm does not explicitly handle the case where both numbers are leading zeroes or have significant leading zeroes but are equal. 

Thus, the program's correctness is questionable since it could fail on unspecified edge cases, leading to the conclusion.
