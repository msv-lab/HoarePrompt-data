Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integers represented as strings, reads them from input, and compares them lexicographically after stripping leading zeroes. It prints '<' if the first number is less than the second, '>' if it is greater, and '=' if they are equal. If either number is empty, it treats it as '0' for the comparison. It handles cases where both inputs may be empty, leading to both being considered as '0'. **
