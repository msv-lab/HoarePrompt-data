Postcondition: ***`a` is the string value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, or '0' if empty; `b` is the string value of `data[1]` without leading zeroes, or '0' if initially empty. If the length of `a` is less than that of `b`, the output is '<'. If the length of `a` is greater than that of `b`, the output is '>'. If the lengths are equal, the function compares `a` and `b` lexicographically: if `a` is less than `b`, the output is '<'; if `a` is greater than `b`, the output is '>'; if both are equal, the output is '='. This covers all edge cases, including scenarios where both strings could be empty, resulting in both being treated as '0'.***
