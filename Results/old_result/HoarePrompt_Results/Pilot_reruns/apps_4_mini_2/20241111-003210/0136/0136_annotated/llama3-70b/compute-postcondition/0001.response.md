The variable `b` is assigned the value of `input().lstrip('0')`, which means that any leading zeroes from the input string are removed. The initial state indicates that `a` is an input string with leading zeroes removed, meaning `a` is already in a processed form without leading zeros. The variable `b` will now hold a new value based on the user input, which may or may not have leading zeroes. Since `a` remains unchanged, the final output state reflects the new value of `b` after the leading zeroes are stripped.

Output State: **`a` is the input string with leading zeroes removed, `b` is the input string with leading zeroes stripped**
