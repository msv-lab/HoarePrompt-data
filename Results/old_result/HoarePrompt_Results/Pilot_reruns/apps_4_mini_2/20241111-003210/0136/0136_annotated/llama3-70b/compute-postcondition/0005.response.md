Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are input strings with leading zeroes removed. If `a` is less than `b`, the function prints '<'; otherwise, it prints '>'. This includes cases where both strings are equal, in which case no output occurs, as well as potential edge cases where either string may be empty or consist of digits only, ensuring that comparisons are made based on their lexicographical order.***
