Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integer inputs as strings, strips any leading zeroes, and compares them lexicographically. It prints '=' if the two inputs are equal, '<' if the first input is lexicographically less than the second, and '>' if the first input is lexicographically greater than the second. The function does not return any value; it only prints the comparison result. **
