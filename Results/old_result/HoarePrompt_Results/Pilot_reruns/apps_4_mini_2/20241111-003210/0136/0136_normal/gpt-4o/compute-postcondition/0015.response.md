Postcondition: ***`a` is the first element of `data` with leading zeroes removed, and it is set to '0' if it was initially an empty string. `b` is '0' if it was initially an empty string; otherwise, `b` remains unchanged. The output will be '<' if the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, '>' if the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. This encompasses all edge cases, including scenarios where both `a` and `b` are '0' or when either is an empty string, ensuring accurate comparisons are made.***
