The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are strings representing non-negative integers that may contain leading zeroes, and each string contains no more than 10^6 digits. The function processes these parameters and returns the result of a specific operation based on the values of `a` and `b`. However, the exact output of the function based on these inputs is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, the functionality of the function can only be described in terms of the accepted parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`, both of which are strings representing non-negative integers that may contain leading zeroes, with a maximum length of 10^6 digits each.**
