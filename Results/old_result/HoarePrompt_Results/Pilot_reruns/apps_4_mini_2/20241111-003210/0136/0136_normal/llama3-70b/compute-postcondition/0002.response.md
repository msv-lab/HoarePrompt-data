The code executes a `print` statement that outputs the string `=`. The values of the variables `a` and `b` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged variables along with the output from the print statement.

Output State: **`a` is the input string without leading zeroes, `b` is the input string without leading zeroes, and the output is '='**
