Correctness: **False**.

The given program attempts to compare two very long integers represented as strings after stripping leading zeroes. However, there is a logical flaw in how it handles the comparison when both numbers are equal after stripping leading zeroes.

Consider the following input case:

Input:
```
000000
000000
```

Expected Output:
```
=
```

However, the program will process this as:
1. After stripping leading zeroes, both `a` and `b` will be empty strings.
2. When checking if `not a`, it sets `a` to `'0'`.
3. It does the same for `b`, setting it to `'0'`.

The lengths of both `a` and `b` will be equal (both will be `'0'`), leading to the comparison `elif a > b`, which will evaluate to `False`, and so the program will incorrectly conclude that the two numbers are not equal.

Thus, the output will be:
```
>
```
instead of the expected output of `=`. Hence, the program does not handle this case correctly.
