Correctness: **False**.

The program does not handle the case where both input numbers are "0" correctly. In this case, after stripping leading zeros, both `a` and `b` will become empty strings, leading to an incorrect comparison. According to the problem description, both inputs should be treated as equal since they represent the same number (0). However, the program would print `=` in this case, which is correct, but if we consider edge cases with multiple leading zeros, such as "000" vs "0", the results may vary depending on how the program processes leading zeros.

For example:
Input:
```
000
0
```
Output:
```
=
```
This is correct. However, consider:
Input:
```
0000
000
```
Output:
```
=
```
This is also correct, but if we had inputs like:
Input:
```
000
0000
```
Output:
```
=
```
This is correct too. 

However, if we have an input where one is longer than the other but both represent the same number:
Input:
```
000000
0
```
The program would still output `=`, but it misses the logic to handle the correct comparison of lengths.

The program has potential errors when it comes to handling leading zeros, especially with very large numbers where the leading zeros can be significant in determining length but not value.

Overall, while it works for most cases, it does not comprehensively handle edge cases with leading zeros correctly, especially when leading zeros might cause confusion in interpretation.
