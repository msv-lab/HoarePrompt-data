To analyze the provided code snippet:

1. The initial state indicates that `a` is equal to the previous value of `b` and `b` is greater than 0.
2. The line `a, b = b, a % b` performs a simultaneous assignment:
   - `a` is assigned the current value of `b`.
   - `b` is assigned the result of `a % b`, where `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`.

Since `a` takes the value of `b`, and `b` is greater than 0, the value of `a % b` will be the remainder of the division of the previous value of `b` by `b`, which is 0.

Now, calculating the new values:
- The new value of `a` becomes the previous value of `b`.
- The new value of `b` becomes `0`.

Therefore, the output state is:
`a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, `b` is now `0`.

Output State: **`a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, `b` is now 0**
