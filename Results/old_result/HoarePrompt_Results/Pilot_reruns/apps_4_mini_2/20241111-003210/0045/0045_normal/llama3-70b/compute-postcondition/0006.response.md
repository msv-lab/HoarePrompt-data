Output State: **If `b` is greater than 0, the loop will continue executing until `b` becomes 0, resulting in `a` being the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of `n` and `k`. If `b` is 0 initially, the loop will not execute, and `a` will retain its initial value (which should be `n` or `k` depending on the context). After the loop, `b` will be 0, and `a` will be the GCD of `n` and `k`.**
