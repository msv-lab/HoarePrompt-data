The code snippet performs a simultaneous assignment where `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The value of `a` is originally assigned to `b`, which is greater than 0. Since `b` is valid and positive, the operation `a % b` will yield a non-negative result. 

However, since the initial values of `a` and `b` are not provided, we can only express the outcome in terms of their relationship. After the execution, `a` will have the value of `b`, and `b` will have the value of `a % b`. 

Thus, the output state can be expressed as:
- `a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`.
- `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a` modulo the previous value of `b`.

Output State: **`a` is now equal to the previous value of `b`, `b` is now equal to the previous value of `a` modulo the previous value of `b`.**
