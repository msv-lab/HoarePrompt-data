To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute, we need to analyze the provided state and the loop statement.

The loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`, which means `i` will take values starting from `k - 1` and decrementing until it reaches `0`. For the loop to execute, `k` must be at least `1`, because if `k` is `0`, the range would be `range(-1, -1, -1)`, which does not yield any values.

We also need to consider the current values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence` as they will not affect the loop's ability to execute, but they are relevant to the state after the loop starts. The loop's execution depends primarily on the value of `k`.

Before the loop starts, `k` is a positive integer. Therefore, we can conclude that `k` must be at least `1` to ensure that the loop executes, and the starting value of `i` would be `k - 1`. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `k` must be greater than or equal to `1`.
- `i` should be initialized to `k - 1`.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, `d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated as `remainder = n - d * min_sum`, `sequence` is a list containing the first `k` multiples of `d`, `i` is `k - 1`**
