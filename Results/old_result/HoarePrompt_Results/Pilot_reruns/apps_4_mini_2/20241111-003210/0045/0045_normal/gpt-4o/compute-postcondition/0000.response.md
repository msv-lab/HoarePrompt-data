The expression `min_sum = k * (k + 1) // 2` calculates the minimum sum of the first `k` positive integers. Since `k` is a positive integer within the range specified (1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10), the value of `min_sum` will be computed based on the specific value of `k`. However, since `k` can take any positive integer value in that range, the exact value of `min_sum` cannot be determined without knowing `k`. 

Thus, the output state reflects that `min_sum` is assigned the value of the sum of the first `k` integers, but the specific value depends on the value of `k`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers, which is `k * (k + 1) // 2`**
