In the given code, `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The initial state provides that `a` is `k` and `b` is `n % k`, with the additional information that `n` is not a multiple of `k`. 

Since `n` is not a multiple of `k`, `b` (which is `n % k`) will be a positive integer less than `k`. The operation `a % b` will yield a value that is less than `b` as well. 

Let's denote the initial values:
- `a` = `k`
- `b` = `n % k` (which is a positive integer less than `k`)

After executing the code:
1. `a` takes the value of `b`, so `a` becomes `n % k`.
2. `b` takes the value of `a % b`, which is `k % (n % k)`.

Thus, the output state reflects the new values of `a` and `b`:
- `a` is now `n % k`
- `b` is now `k % (n % k)`

Output State: **`a` is `n % k`, `b` is `k % (n % k)`**
