The code snippet `a, b = b, a % b` is performing a simultaneous assignment where `a` and `b` are being updated. 

Since `n` and `k` are positive integers, let's assign `a = n` and `b = k` for this operation. The value of `a` is replaced with the current value of `b`, and the value of `b` is replaced with the result of `a % b`, which is the remainder of `a` divided by `b`.

Given that `n` and `k` are positive integers, after executing the code:
- `a` will now hold the value of `k` (previously `b`).
- `b` will hold the value of `n % k`.

The output state will reflect these changes, while the exact values of `a` and `b` depend on the specific values of `n` and `k`.

Output State: **`a` is `k`, `b` is `n % k`**
