The variable `min_sum` is assigned the value of `k * (k + 1) // 2`, which calculates the sum of the first `k` positive integers. The values of `n` and `k` are positive integers, but their specific values are not provided. Hence, we cannot determine the exact value of `min_sum` but we know it is calculated based on the value of `k`. The state of `n` is unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10; `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2**
