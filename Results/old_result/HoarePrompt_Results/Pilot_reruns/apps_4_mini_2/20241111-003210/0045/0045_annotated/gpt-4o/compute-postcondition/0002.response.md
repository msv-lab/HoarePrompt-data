Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, and `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function does not return any value, and the state remains unchanged with respect to `n` and `k`.***
