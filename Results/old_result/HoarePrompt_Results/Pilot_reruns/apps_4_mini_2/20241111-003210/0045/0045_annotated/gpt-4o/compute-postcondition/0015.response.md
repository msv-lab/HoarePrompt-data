To analyze the provided code snippet, we need to break down the operations and their effects on the initial state of the variables.

Given the initial state:
- `n` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 10^{10}\)
- `k` is a positive integer such that \(1 \leq k \leq 10^{10}\)
- `min_sum` is calculated as \(k \times (k + 1) // 2\)
- `d` is assigned the value \(n // min_sum\)
- `sequence[i]` (where \(i\) is \(k - 2\)) is incremented by 1

Now we have the operation:
```
remainder -= 1
```

In this context, we interpret that `remainder` is a variable that is being decremented by 1. However, since `remainder` was not defined in the initial state, we cannot ascertain its prior value. 

Since this operation modifies `remainder` directly but does not provide any information about its previous value, we conclude that the output state will reflect the change without specifying the value of `remainder`.

Thus, the output state will indicate that `remainder` has been decremented by 1, while the other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^10, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is assigned the value `n // min_sum`, `sequence[i]` (where `i` is `k - 2`) is incremented by 1, and `remainder` is decremented by 1.**
