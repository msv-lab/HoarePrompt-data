The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and since its previous value is 0, the new value of `count` becomes 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `b` is 0, and `count` is 1.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 1` zeros, `b` is 0, and `count` is 1**
