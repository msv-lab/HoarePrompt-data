Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` contains the prefix balance values for each index from 1 to `n`, where `prefix_balances[i]` is the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's for the first `i` characters of `s`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `-1` is appended to `results`. If `x` is not found, `0` is appended to `results`. If `n` is 0, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, and `results` will append `0` since `x` cannot be in an empty list. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is calculated as the number of times `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` holds true for each `b` in `prefix_balances`, and this value of `count` is appended to `results`.***
