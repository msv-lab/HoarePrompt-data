According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3, and `n` must be at least 3 to allow for one more iteration (since the loop runs from `1` to `n`, inclusive). The value of `prefix_balances[i]` does not need to be modified, as it will be evaluated during the next iteration.

State: **`prefix_balances[i]` is either 2, 0, or -2; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1; `i` is 3; `n` is greater than or equal to 3**
