Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list containing the cumulative balance of zeros and ones based on the string `s`. If the `balance` is 0 and `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, then -1 is appended to `results`. If `balance` is 0 and `x` is not present, then 0 is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0, the `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` such that `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and this count is appended to `results`. The state of `prefix_balances` remains unchanged regardless of the conditions, and if `n` is 0 or negative, `prefix_balances` has only one element, which is 0.***
