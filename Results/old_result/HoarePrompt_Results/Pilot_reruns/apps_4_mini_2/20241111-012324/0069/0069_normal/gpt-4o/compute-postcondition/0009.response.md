The value of `index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is 1, so after execution, `index` becomes 4. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 10^5) assigned from `data[1]`, `x` is an integer assigned from `int(data[index + 1])`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list.
