According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will execute while `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is at least 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 4, and `n` must be greater than or equal to 4 (since `i` must remain less than or equal to `n`).

Thus, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `i` is now 4, and since `n` is at least 3, it needs to be adjusted to be at least 4 to allow for the next iteration.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, `i` is 4, `n` is >= 4, `prefix_balances[i]` is either `x + 1` or `x - 1`**
