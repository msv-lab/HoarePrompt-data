The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the result of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. Given that `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros, the initial value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` is 0. The expression `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)` evaluates to either 1 or -1 depending on the value of `s[i - 1]`. Therefore, `prefix_balances[i]` will be either 1 or -1.

Thus, the output state reflects the values of `prefix_balances` and the determined value of `prefix_balances[i]`. Since `prefix_balances` has a length greater than 1 and starts with zeros, we can conclude:

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros (length > 1), `i` is 2, `n` is >= 1, `prefix_balances[i]` is either 1 or -1**
