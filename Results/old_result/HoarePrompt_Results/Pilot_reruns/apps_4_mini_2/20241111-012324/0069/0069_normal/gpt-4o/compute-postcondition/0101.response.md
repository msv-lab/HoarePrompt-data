According to the code, the loop's execution depends on the variable `T`. If `T` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, it is implied that `T` has been decremented by 1 due to the loop structure. Therefore, to allow the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be adjusted to be greater than 0.

State: **`prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of '0's and '1's differences up to index `n`, `balance` is 0, `x` is found in `prefix_balances`, `results` contains `-1`, `T` is greater than 0**
