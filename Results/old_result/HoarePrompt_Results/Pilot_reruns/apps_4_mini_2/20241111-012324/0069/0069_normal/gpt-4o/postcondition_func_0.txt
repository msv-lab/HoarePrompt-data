The function accepts multiple test cases, each defined by a positive integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a binary string `s`. It calculates the balance of '0's and '1's in the string and determines the possible configurations for achieving a specific balance defined by `x`. If the net balance is zero, it checks whether `x` is present in the cumulative balance list and returns -1 if found, or 0 if not. If the balance is not zero, it counts how many values in the cumulative balance list allow a valid configuration to achieve `x` and returns that count. The results of each test case are printed. The function does not explicitly return any values, as it outputs results directly to the console.
