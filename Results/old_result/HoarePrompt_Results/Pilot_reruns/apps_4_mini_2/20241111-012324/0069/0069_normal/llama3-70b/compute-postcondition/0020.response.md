Postcondition: ***`balance` is equal to `cnt0 - cnt1`, where `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, and `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`. If `balance` equals `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0` and `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. This ensures that division by zero is avoided by checking that `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` before performing the modulus operation, and it accounts for all scenarios, including when `x` is less than, equal to, or greater than `balance`. Additionally, it includes edge cases where `cnt0` or `cnt1` may be zero, which would affect the calculations involving `cnt0 - cnt1`.***
