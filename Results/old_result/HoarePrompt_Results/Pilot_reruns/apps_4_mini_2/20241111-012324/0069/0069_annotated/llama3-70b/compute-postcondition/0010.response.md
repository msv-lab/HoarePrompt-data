Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is an integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, the function prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1` and `x` is not equal to `balance`, the function prints -1 to handle the case where division by zero would occur. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the integer division of `(x - balance)` by `(cnt0 - cnt1)` incremented by 1, which accounts for scenarios where `balance` is not equal to `x` and `cnt0` is different from `cnt1`.***
