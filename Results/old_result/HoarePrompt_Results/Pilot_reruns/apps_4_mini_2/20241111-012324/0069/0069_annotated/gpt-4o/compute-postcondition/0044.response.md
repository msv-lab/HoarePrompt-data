According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop is designed to iterate from 1 to `n + 1`, which means that `n` must be at least 1 for the loop to execute at least once. Before the loop starts, `prefix_balances` is initialized as a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, but this does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, at the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be initialized to 1, as it is the starting point of the iteration.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
