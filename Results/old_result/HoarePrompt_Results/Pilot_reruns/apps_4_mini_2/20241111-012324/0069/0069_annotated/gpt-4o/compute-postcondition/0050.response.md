According to the code, the loop is controlled by the variable `i`, which starts at 1 and increments by 1 with each iteration until it reaches `n + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3. The value of `n` remains unchanged, but we need to ensure that `n` is at least 2 for the loop to execute again.

Since `prefix_balances[2]` is either `prefix_balances[1] + 1` or `prefix_balances[1] - 1`, no adjustment is needed for that state as it can stay the same. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be changed to 3.
- `n` should remain unchanged but must be at least 2.

State: **`prefix_balances[2]` is either `prefix_balances[1] + 1` or `prefix_balances[1] - 1`, `i` is 3, `n` is unchanged**
