Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `n` is a positive integer, `x` is a positive integer, `s` is an input binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is updated to `cnt0 - cnt1`, and `T` is decremented by 1. If `balance` equals `x`, the output is `n + 1`. If `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the output is -1. If `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, and `balance` is not equal to `x`, the output will also be -1. Otherwise, the output is computed as `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, ensuring that all cases, including potential division by zero, are handled appropriately.***
