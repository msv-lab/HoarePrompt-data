Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 3 elements, `count` is 0 or 1. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented by 1, indicating that the condition is satisfied. If the condition is not satisfied, `count` remains 0. Additionally, `b` is the third element of `prefix_balances`.***
