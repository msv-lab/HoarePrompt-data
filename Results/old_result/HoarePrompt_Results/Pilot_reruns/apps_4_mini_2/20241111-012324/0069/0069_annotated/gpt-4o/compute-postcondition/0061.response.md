Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, and `count` is initialized to 0. If the expression `(x - b) % balance == 0` is true and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented to 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0. This ensures that `count` reflects whether `x` is aligned with the balance criteria relative to `b`, considering edge cases where the calculated value may be negative or not divisible by `balance`.***
