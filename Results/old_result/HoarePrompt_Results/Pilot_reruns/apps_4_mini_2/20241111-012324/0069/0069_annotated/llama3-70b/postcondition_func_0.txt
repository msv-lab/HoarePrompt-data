The function accepts a positive integer `T` (number of test cases), and for each test case, it takes a positive integer `n`, an integer `x`, and a binary string `s` of length `n`. It counts the occurrences of '0's and '1's in the string `s`, calculates the balance (difference between counts of '0's and '1's), and prints results based on specific conditions: it outputs `n + 1` if balance equals `x`, `-1` if the counts of '0's and '1's are equal and the balance does not equal `x`, and computes a formula based on the difference between `x` and the balance divided by the difference of counts if they are not equal. If `T` is 0, the function does not execute any test cases.
