The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `fractions`. The parameter `n` is an integer that must satisfy the constraint \(1 \leq n \leq 200,000\). The parameter `fractions` is a string of length `n`, consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', which represent the two factions of employees. The function processes these inputs and produces an output based on the specified logic. 

Since the specific output behavior is not provided in the prompt, we cannot detail the return values. However, the functionality can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000) and a string fractions of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', and processes them according to the specified logic.**
