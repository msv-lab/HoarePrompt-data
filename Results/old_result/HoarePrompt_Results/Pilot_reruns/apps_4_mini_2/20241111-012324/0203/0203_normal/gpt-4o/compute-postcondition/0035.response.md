According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, it is stated that both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. Therefore, there is no need to adjust any states related to the queues for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`d_queue` is not empty, `r_queue` is not empty, `d_index` and `r_index` represent the first elements of their respective queues**
