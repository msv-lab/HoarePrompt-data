Output State: **`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' characters in `fractions`, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, and `fractions` is a string of length `n`. If `n` is 0 or if `fractions` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0.**
