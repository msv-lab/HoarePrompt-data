According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the states of `d_queue` and `r_queue`. The loop can only execute if both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `d_queue` is not empty, but `r_queue` is empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `r_queue` needs to be modified to contain at least one element, which will allow the loop condition to be satisfied.

State: **`d_queue` is not empty and `r_queue` is not empty**
