Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length `n`; `fraction` is the second character of `fractions`. If the first character of `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is incremented by 1, resulting in a value of either 2 if it was initially 1 or 1 if it was initially 0; `remocrats` remains unchanged. If the first character is not 'D', then `remocrats` is incremented by 1, resulting in a value of either 2 if it was initially 1 or 1 if it was initially 0; `depublicans` is unchanged. In all cases, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` will be at least 0 following the execution.***
