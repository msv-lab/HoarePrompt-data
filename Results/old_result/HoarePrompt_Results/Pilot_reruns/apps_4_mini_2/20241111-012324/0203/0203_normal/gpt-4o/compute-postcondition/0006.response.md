The code appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue` list. The initial value of `i` is 0. After execution, `r_queue` will contain the element 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` contains 0, `i` is 0, and `v` is the first character of `votes`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `votes` is an input string of length `n`, `d_queue` is an empty list, `r_queue` contains 0, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character of `votes`**
