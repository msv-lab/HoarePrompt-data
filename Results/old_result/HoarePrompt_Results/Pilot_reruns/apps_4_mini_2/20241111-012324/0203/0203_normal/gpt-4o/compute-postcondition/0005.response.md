The code appends the current value of `i` (which is 0) to the `d_queue`. The previous values of the affected variables are `d_queue` (which is initially an empty list) and `i` (which is 0). After executing the code, `d_queue` will contain the value 0, while other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `votes` is an input string of length `n`; `d_queue` is [0]; `r_queue` is an empty list; `i` is 0; `v` is the first character of `votes`**
