Correctness: **False**.

The program incorrectly predicts the outcome of the vote. It simply counts the number of 'D' and 'R' characters and declares the winner based on which count is greater. However, the problem description states that the voting process is complex and involves employees denying each other the right to vote, which can change the outcome significantly.

For instance, consider the input:
```
5
DRDRD
```
In this case, each employee can deny the next one, leading to a scenario where only the first employee (D) remains eligible to vote. According to the rules, this could lead to a win for the depublicans. The program fails to account for this strategic aspect of the voting process, which makes its prediction incorrect in many scenarios. Therefore, the logic of simply counting fractions is insufficient and does not align with the problem description.
