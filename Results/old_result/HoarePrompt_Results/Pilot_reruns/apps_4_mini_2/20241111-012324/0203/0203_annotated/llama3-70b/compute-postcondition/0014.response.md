The value of `remocrats` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `remocrats` is unknown. The values of `n`, `fractions`, and `fraction` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n`; `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one; `remocrats` is increased by 1.
