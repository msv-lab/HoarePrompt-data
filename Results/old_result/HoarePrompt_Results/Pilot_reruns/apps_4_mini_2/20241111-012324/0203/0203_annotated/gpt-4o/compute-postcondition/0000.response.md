The variable `n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `votes` remains unaffected as there is no operation involving it in this code snippet. Given that `n` is defined as a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, the output state reflects this condition.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `votes` remains a string of length n consisting only of 'D' and 'R'**
