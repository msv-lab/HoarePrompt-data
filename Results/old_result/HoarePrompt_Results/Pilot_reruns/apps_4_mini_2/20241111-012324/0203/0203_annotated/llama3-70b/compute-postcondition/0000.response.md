The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variable `fractions` remains unchanged as it is not affected by this line of code. The initial condition for `n` is that it is a positive integer within the range of 1 to 200,000. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `n` after input, while `fractions` remains a string of length `n`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R'**.
