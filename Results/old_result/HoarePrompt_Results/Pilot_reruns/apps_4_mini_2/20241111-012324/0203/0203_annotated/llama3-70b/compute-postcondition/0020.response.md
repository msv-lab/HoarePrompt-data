Postcondition: ***`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' characters in `fractions`, and `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of 'D' and 'R'. If `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, 'D' is printed. Otherwise, 'R' is printed, which also includes the case when they are equal.***
