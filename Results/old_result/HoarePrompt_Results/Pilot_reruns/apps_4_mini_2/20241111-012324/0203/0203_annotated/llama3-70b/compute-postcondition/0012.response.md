According to the code, the loop iterates over each character in the string `fractions`. The loop can execute again as long as there are more characters left in the string to process. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, and `fraction` is the next character in the string. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be greater than the current index of `fraction` in the string, and `fraction` should be the next character in `fractions`. 

Since `fraction` is currently the next character in the string, we need to adjust the state such that `fraction` becomes the next character after the current one. Consequently, `n` will remain unchanged, as it still reflects the total length of the string. 

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000, `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n`, and `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one.**
