Functionality: ** The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a string `votes` of length `n`, consisting only of the characters 'D' and 'R'. It evaluates the votes through a process of pairwise comparisons, where the indices of 'D' and 'R' characters are compared. The function determines which character wins based on these comparisons, and prints 'D' if 'D' characters remain after all comparisons, otherwise it prints 'R'. If there are no votes (an empty string), it defaults to printing 'R'. **
