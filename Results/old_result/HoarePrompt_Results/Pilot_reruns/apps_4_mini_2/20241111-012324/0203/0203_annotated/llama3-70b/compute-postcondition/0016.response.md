According to the code, the loop will continue to execute as long as there are more characters in the `fractions` string. Since `n` is a positive integer representing the length of `fractions`, and `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one, we need to ensure that the next iteration will have access to the next character in the string.

At the end of the last iteration, `fraction` is the next character in the string. For the loop to execute one more time, `fraction` needs to be updated to the next character in the `fractions` string. Since `fraction` is currently the next character, we can infer that the current index (or position) is less than `n - 1`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state accordingly to reflect that the loop has moved to the next character.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200,000; `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n`; `fraction` is the next character in the string after the current one; `current_index` is incremented by 1.**
