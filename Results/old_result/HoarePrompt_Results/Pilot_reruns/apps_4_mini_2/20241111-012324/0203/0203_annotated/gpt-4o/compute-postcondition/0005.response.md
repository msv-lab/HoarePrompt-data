`d_queue` is modified to append the current value of `i`, which is 0. The variable `i` remains unchanged, and the other variables are unaffected. Hence, after execution, `d_queue` will contain the value `[0]`. The output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character of votes.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 200000, `votes` is a string of length n consisting only of 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is [0], `r_queue` is an empty list, `i` is 0, `v` is the first character of votes**
