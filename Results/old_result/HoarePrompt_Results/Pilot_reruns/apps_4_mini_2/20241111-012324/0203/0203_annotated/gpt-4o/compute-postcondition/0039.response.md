Postcondition: ***If `d_queue` is non-empty, 'D' is printed; if `d_queue` is empty, 'R' is printed. If both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are empty, 'R' will be printed, indicating that no characters have won. If `votes` is an empty string, both queues remain empty and the loop does not execute, leading to the same output behavior.***
