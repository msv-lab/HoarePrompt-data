Output State: **`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' characters in `fractions`, `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n` consisting only of 'D' and 'R'. If `n` is 0 (though it is given that 1 â‰¤ n), then the loop does not execute and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0.**
