The `print('D')` statement outputs the string 'D' to the console. It does not affect the values of `depublicans`, `remocrats`, or `fractions`. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables along with the indication that 'D' has been printed.

Output State: **`depublicans` is the count of 'D' characters in `fractions`, `remocrats` is the count of 'R' characters in `fractions`, `fractions` is a non-empty string of length `n`, and 'D' has been printed.**
