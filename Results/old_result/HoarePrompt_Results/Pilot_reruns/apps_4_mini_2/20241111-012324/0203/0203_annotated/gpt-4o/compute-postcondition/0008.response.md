According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `votes` string, which is `n`. The loop will iterate through each character in `votes`, and the loop will continue executing as long as `i` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know that `i` corresponds to the index of the current character being processed, which means `i` has been incremented from its previous value. Specifically, if the loop has just finished executing for `i`, the next value of `i` will be `i + 1`.

Since `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is still less than `n` for the loop to execute one more time. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `i` to be equal to `n - 1`, meaning the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 200000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, `i` is `n - 1`, `v` is the character at index `n - 1` in `votes`**
