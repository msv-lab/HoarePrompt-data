The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n % i`. The value of `i` is 1, and since any number modulo 1 is 0, the value of `remainder` will be `0`. The other variables `n`, `k`, `seen`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is set(), `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is set(), `i` is 1, `remainder` is 0**
