The function returns the string `'No'`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged as the return statement does not affect their state. Therefore, the output state reflects that `n` and `k` are still integers within the defined range, and the function returns the string `'No'`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, and the function returns 'No'**.
