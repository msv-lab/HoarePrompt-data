The function `func` does not explicitly accept any parameters as it is defined without any parameters. However, it operates under the constraints that `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying the condition 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Since the output is not provided in the prompt, we cannot determine the specific return value of the function. Thus, based on the given information, we can summarize the functionality as follows:

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but operates on the positive integers n and k, which must satisfy 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. The specific return value is not defined.**
