Output State: **If k is at least 1, the loop will execute up to k times, and `seen` will contain remainders of n when divided by integers from 1 to k. If at any point a remainder is found in `seen`, 'No' will be printed, and the program will exit. If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen` remains an empty set.**
