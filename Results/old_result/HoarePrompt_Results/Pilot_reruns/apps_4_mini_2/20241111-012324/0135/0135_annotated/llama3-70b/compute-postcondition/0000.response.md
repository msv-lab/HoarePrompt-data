The values of `n` and `k` are assigned from `input()` after being split and converted to integers. As `n` and `k` are already defined as positive integers within the specified range, the output state will reflect their new values, which are derived directly from the input. 

Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `k` is an input integer**
