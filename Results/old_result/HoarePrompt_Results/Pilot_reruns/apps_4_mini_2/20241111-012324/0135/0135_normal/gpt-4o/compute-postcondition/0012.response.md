Output State: **If `k` is at least 1, the loop will execute exactly `k` times, and `seen_remainders` will contain the remainders of `n` when divided by each integer from 1 to `k`. If any `remainder` is found in `seen_remainders` during the iterations, the function will return 'No'. If `k` is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and `seen_remainders` remains an empty set.**
