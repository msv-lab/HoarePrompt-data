The code `exit()` is called, which causes the program to terminate immediately. The values of the variables remain unchanged because the exit function does not modify any variables or produce any output. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables along with the indication that the program has exited.

Output State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18; `k` is greater than or equal to 3; `seen` is either {0} or {0, 1}; `i` is 3; `remainder` is `n % 3`, and the program has exited.**
