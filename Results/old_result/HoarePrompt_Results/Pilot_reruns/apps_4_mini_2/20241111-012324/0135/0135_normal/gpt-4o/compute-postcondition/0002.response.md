The code initializes an empty set called `seen_remainders`. The state of the other variables (`n` and `k`) is not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state will still reflect the original values of `n` and `k`, along with the new state of `seen_remainders`.

Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18; `seen_remainders` is an empty set**
