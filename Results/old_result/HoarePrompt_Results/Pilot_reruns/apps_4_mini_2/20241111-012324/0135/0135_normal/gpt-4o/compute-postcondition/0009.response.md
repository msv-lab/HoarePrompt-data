According to the code, the loop will execute while the value of `i` is within the range defined by `1` to `k + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, `k` must be at least 2, allowing `i` to be less than or equal to `k`.

Since `k` is already greater than or equal to 1, we only need to ensure it is at least 2 for the loop to proceed. The `seen_remainders` set remains unchanged as it is empty and does not affect the loop's execution.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that `k` is greater than or equal to 2, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 3, and `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
