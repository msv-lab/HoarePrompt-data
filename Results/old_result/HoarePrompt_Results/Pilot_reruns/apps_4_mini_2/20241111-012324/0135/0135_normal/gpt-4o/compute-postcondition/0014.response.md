The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `k`. Both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^18. 

- In Case 1, if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, the function returns 'No'. 
- In Case 2, if `k` is less than `n`, the function may not return a value, indicating that it could complete without returning anything, unless `k` is at least 1, in which case the loop executes `k` times. If any remainder is found in `seen_remainders`, it returns 'No'. 
- In Case 3, if `k` is at least 1 and no remainders are found during the loop iterations, the function returns 'Yes'. If `k` is less than 1, it does not execute the loop and still leads to the conclusion of 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, it may return 'Yes' if no remainders are found when `k` is at least 1, or complete without returning anything if `k` is less than 1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `n` and `k`, returns 'No' if `k` is greater than or equal to `n`. If `k` is less than `n`, it may return 'Yes' if no remainders are found during the iterations with `k` at least 1, or complete without returning anything if `k` is less than 1.**
