To determine the correctness of the provided program, we will analyze how it handles the requirements in the problem description.

The problem requires checking if all remainders of `n` when divided by all integers from `1` to `k` are distinct. The program correctly implements the following logic:

1. If `k` is greater than or equal to `n`, it returns "No" because the remainders when dividing by `1` and `n` will always be the same (both will be `0`).
2. It uses a set to keep track of seen remainders.
3. It iterates from `1` to `k`, calculating the remainder `n % i`. If this remainder has been seen before, it returns "No". If not, it adds the remainder to the set. If it completes the loop without finding duplicates, it returns "Yes".

However, there is a critical edge case that the program does not handle correctly:

- Consider the case where `n = 5` and `k = 5`. The remainders would be:
  - `5 % 1 = 0`
  - `5 % 2 = 1`
  - `5 % 3 = 2`
  - `5 % 4 = 1` (which is a repeat)
  - `5 % 5 = 0` (which is also a repeat)

In this scenario, the program will return "No" due to the duplicate remainders, which is correct. However, there are still other cases, especially when `k` is very large compared to `n`. For example, if `n = 1` and `k = 100`, the remainders will all be `0` for any `i > 1`, leading to duplicates.

Additionally, there is another subtle issue:

- If `k < n`, the program assumes that it's acceptable to check remainders up to `k`, but it does not account for remainders that may not appear when `k` is less than `n`. The program currently allows checking only up to `k` but does not consider that remainders could repeat due to their mathematical properties.

Given these considerations and potential edge cases, the program does not handle all scenarios correctly.

Correctness: **False**.
