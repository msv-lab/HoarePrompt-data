The variable `b_block` is assigned the value of the expression `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`. However, since `b` is undefined, the expression cannot be evaluated, which means that `b_block` cannot be calculated either. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input value, `m` is an input value, `k` is an input value, and `b` is undefined.

Output State: **`a` is an input value, `m` is an input value, `k` is an input value, and `b` is undefined**
