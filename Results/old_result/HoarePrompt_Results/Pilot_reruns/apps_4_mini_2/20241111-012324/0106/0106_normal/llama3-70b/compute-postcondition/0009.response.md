Postcondition: ***`a`, `m`, `k` are input values, and `b` is undefined. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10. However, the calculations for `min_floor_time` cannot be completed without defined values for `a_floor`, `b_floor`, and `n`.***
