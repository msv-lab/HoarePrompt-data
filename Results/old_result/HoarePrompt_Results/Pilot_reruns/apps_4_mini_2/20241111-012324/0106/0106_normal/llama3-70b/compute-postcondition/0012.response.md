Functionality: ** The function accepts five integer inputs: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, which are read from standard input. It calculates two values, `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`, based on the positions `a` and `b` in a grid defined by `m` and `k`. However, since `b` is not defined before its usage, the calculations for `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time` may result in an error or incorrect values. Consequently, the function attempts to print the sum of `min_block_time` and `min_floor_time`, which may lead to undefined behavior due to the undefined `b`. Thus, the function does not reliably return a valid output. **
