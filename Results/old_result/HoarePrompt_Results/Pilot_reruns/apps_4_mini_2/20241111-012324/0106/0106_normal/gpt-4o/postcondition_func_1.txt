The function accepts an integer `apartment` and returns a tuple containing the block number and floor number corresponding to that apartment within a structure defined by `m` and `k`, where `m` is the number of floors per block and `k` is the number of apartments per floor. The function assumes valid input parameters, but it does not handle cases where `apartment` might exceed the total number of apartments represented by `n`, `m`, and `k`. Therefore, if `apartment` is greater than `n * m * k`, the function may return incorrect results.
