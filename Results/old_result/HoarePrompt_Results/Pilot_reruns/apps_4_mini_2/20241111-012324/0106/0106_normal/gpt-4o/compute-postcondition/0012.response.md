Functionality: ** The function accepts three positive integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` (with values between 1 and 1000) and two distinct integers `a` and `b` (with values between 1 and `n·m·k`). It calculates the total time required to move from the location of `a` to the location of `b`, taking into account the time to exit the current floor, the walking time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. If `a` is located on the first floor, the exit time is zero; otherwise, it is calculated based on the floor level of `a`. The minimum walking time is determined between direct and reverse walking paths. The total time is the sum of exit time, walking time, and the time to reach the target floor, which is returned. Edge cases include scenarios where `a` is on the first floor or if `a` and `b` are very close in block numbers, affecting the calculated walking times.**
