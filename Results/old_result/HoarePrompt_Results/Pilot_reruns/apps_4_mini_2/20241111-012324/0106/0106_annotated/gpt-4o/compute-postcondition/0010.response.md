The function returns `total_time`, but the values of `total_time`, `reverse_walk_time`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor` are not specified. Therefore, the output state includes the current values of the variables and indicates that the function returns `total_time`.

Output State: **`reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15; `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`; `time_to_target_floor` is (floor_b - 1) * 5; `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`, and the function returns `total_time`.**
