The function accepts three positive integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k`, as well as two distinct integers `a` and `b`. It calculates the total time required to exit from the location corresponding to `a` to the location corresponding to `b`, taking into account the floor level of `a` and the time to exit from that floor, the minimum walking time between the blocks of `a` and `b`, and the time needed to reach the target floor of `b`. The function returns the total time calculated from these parameters. However, if `floor_a` is 1, the time to exit is set to 0; otherwise, it is calculated as `10 + (floor_a - 1)`. The function does not handle cases where `a` or `b` may not be valid locations within the specified range.
