Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the logic specified in the problem description. The key issue lies in how it determines the minimum number of variables `m` needed to perform the operations.

The logic in the loop checks whether each subsequent element in the sorted list `a` is double the previous one. If it is not, it increments `m`. However, this approach does not accurately reflect the requirements of the operations, where the sum of any two variables can yield the next required value. The program fails to account for the distinct values and the potential combinations that could lead to producing the required values.

For example, consider the input:
```
3
3 6 5
```
The correct output should be `-1` because it is impossible to form the value `5` using the values `3` and `6` through the defined operations. However, the program would incorrectly output `2`, as it would increment `m` when it sees that `6` is not double `3`. 

Another example is:
```
5
1 2 3 6 8
```
The program outputs `2`, which is correct, but it does not guarantee that it can handle all possible combinations of sums to yield all required values.

Thus, the program does not correctly implement the logic needed to solve the problem for all potential cases, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
