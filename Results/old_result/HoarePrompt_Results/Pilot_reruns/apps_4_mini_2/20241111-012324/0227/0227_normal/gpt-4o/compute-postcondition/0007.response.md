The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `can_form` was `False`, so after execution, `can_form` is now `True`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True, and `x` is `a[0]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` distinct positive integers, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]`, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is `a[0]**
