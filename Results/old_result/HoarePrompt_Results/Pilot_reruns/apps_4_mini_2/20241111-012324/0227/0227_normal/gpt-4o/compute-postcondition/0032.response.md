Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` contains the element `a[current_i + 2]`, and `x` is equal to `a[current_i + 2]`. If the difference `a[i] - x` exists in `assigned`, `can_form` remains True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` does not exist in `assigned`, the state of `can_form` remains unchanged, and the program continues without breaking.***
