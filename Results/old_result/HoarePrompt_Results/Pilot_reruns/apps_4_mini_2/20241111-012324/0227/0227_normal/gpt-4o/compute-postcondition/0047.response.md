Postcondition: ***`can_form` is False initially. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` (where `x` is the first element in assigned) exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` includes `a[k + 1]`, and `i` is k + 1. If this condition is not met, `can_form` remains False, and all other variable states remain unchanged.***
