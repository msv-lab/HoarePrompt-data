Postcondition: ***`can_form` is True if there exists an `x` in `assigned` such that `a[i] - x` is also in `assigned`. If `can_form` is False (which occurs if `assigned` is empty or if no elements satisfy the condition), then `m` is increased by 1 while `assigned` remains unchanged and contains its initial elements.***
