The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of `can_form` and `m` remain unchanged, and `assigned` still contains the element `a[current_i + 1]`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `can_form` while the other variables remain the same.

Output State: **`can_form` is False, `m` remains unchanged, `assigned` contains the element `a[current_i + 1]**
