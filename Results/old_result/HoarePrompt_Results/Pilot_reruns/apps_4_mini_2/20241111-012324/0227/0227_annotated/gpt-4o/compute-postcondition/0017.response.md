Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]` and another distinct integer from `a`, `a` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `x` is the second distinct integer from `a`. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` exists in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is exited. If the difference does not exist in `assigned`, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
