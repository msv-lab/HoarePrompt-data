The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 23, and the parameter `a` is a list containing `n` distinct integers where each integer `a_k` satisfies 1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9. After executing the function body, if `n` is 1, the function returns `1`. If `n` is at least 2, the function returns `m`, which is the count of elements in `a` that cannot be formed by the difference of any two assigned elements. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct integers `a`, returning `1` if `n` is 1, or returning the count of elements in `a` that cannot be created by the difference of any two elements in the list if `n` is at least 2. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct integers `a`, returning `1` if `n` is 1, or the count of elements in `a` that cannot be formed by the difference of any two elements in `a` if `n` is at least 2.**
