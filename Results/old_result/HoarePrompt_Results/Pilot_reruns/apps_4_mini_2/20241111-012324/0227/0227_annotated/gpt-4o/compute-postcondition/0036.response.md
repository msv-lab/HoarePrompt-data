Postcondition: ***`assigned` is a non-empty set of distinct integers with at least 3 elements, `n` is at least 2, `m` is either 1 or 2 depending on `can_form`, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third element in the `assigned` set. If the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the `assigned` set, then `can_form` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the difference is not in the `assigned` set, `can_form` remains unchanged.***
