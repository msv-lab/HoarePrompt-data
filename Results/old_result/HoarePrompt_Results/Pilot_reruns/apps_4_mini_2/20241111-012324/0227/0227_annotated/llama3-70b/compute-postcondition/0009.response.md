Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a sorted list of `n` integers, and `m` is 2 if `a[1]` is not equal to `a[0] * 2`. If `a[2]` is not equal to `a[1] * 2`, then `m` is increased by 1, resulting in `m` being at least 2. If `a[2]` is equal to `a[1] * 2`, then `m` remains 1 or increases to 2 if `a[1]` was already not equal to `a[0] * 2`. Thus, `m` can be either 1 or 2, depending on the comparisons between the elements of the list `a`.***
