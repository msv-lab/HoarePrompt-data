According to the code, the loop iterates over the elements in `assigned`. For the loop to execute one more time, the following conditions must be satisfied: 

1. The `assigned` list must have at least one more element beyond the current one being processed.
2. The variable `x` must be updated to the next element in the `assigned` list.
3. The index that corresponds to the element being processed (in this case, `x`) should reflect that we're moving to the next element.

Since `assigned` is a list containing at least one element, and `x` is currently the first element, there must be at least one more element in `assigned` for the loop to continue. 

To summarize, if `x` is the first element, for the loop to execute again, `x` must be updated to the second element in the list. 

Thus:
- `assigned` must have at least 2 elements.
- `x` should be updated to the second element in `assigned`.

State: **`m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, `assigned` is a list containing at least 2 elements, `x` is the second element in the list**.
