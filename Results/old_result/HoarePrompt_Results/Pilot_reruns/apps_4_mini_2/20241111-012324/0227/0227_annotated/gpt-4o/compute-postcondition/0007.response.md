The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `True`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated value of `can_form` while retaining the previous states of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `assigned` is a set containing `a[0]`, `a` is a sorted list of distinct integers, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is `a[0]`**
