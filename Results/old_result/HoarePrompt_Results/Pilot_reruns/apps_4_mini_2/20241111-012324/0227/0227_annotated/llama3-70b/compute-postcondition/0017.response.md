Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (1 ≤ n ≤ 23) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9). It counts the number of elements in the sorted list `a` that do not follow the doubling condition `a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2` for all `1 ≤ i < n`, and prints this count if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. If `n` is 1, it will always print 1 since the loop does not execute. The function does not return any value but prints the result directly.**
