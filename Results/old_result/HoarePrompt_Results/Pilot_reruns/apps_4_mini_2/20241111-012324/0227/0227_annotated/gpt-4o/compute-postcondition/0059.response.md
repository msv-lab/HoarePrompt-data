Postcondition: ***If `assigned` is a non-empty list, after checking each element `x` in `assigned`, `can_form` will be True if there exists an `x` such that `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, otherwise `can_form` will remain False and `m` will be increased by 1. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute, `can_form` remains False, and `m` is increased by 1. In either case, `assigned` remains unchanged.***
