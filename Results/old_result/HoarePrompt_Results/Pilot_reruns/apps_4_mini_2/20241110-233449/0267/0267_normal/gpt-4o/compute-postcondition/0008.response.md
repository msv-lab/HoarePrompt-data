The variable `total_sum` is assigned the value `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. Since `total_sum` is initially 0, the expression simplifies to `num % MOD`. Other variables (`l`, `r`, and `k`) are not directly affected by this operation. However, we need to note the unknown value of `num` and the constant MOD assumption (which is not specified).

Given that `total_sum` is initially 0, the state after executing the code will express the dependency on `num` and the unchanged state of the other variables. 

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r - 1` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that `r` is at least `l + 1`, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10, `total_sum` is `num % MOD`**
