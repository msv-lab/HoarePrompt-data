The variable `total_sum` is initialized to `0`. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` are not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables. 

Output State: **`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10, and `total_sum` is 0**
