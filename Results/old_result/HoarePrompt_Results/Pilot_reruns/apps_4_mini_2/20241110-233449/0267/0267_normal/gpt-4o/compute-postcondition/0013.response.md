The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. Both `l` and `r` are integers with the constraints that 1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer with the constraint that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10. After executing the function body, it returns `total_sum`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `l` and `r` within specified bounds, and an integer `k`, then compute and return `total_sum` based on these inputs. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two integers l and r within the range 1 ≤ l ≤ r < 10^18, and an integer k within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 10, and returns total_sum based on these parameters.**
