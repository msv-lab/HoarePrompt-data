Postcondition: ***`l` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10. If `k` equals 0, the function returns 0. If `k` is greater than 0 and the pair `(n, k)` exists in `dp`, the function returns `dp[n, k]`. If `(n, k)` does not exist in `dp`, there is no return value, and the state of the variables remains unchanged.***
