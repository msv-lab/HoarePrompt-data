Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is 0 initially. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, where `num` is `l + 1`, then `total_sum` is updated to (0 + (l + 1)) % MOD. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false, `total_sum` remains 0. This covers the case where `num` is in the range from 2 to `r + 1` and the potential outcomes of `func_1` based on its implementation.***
