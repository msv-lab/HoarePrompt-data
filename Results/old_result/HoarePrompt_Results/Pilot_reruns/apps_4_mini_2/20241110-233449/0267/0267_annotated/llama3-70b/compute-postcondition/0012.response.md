According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. In the given state, `i` is 1 and `k` is 2. Thus, the loop can execute again because `i` is less than `k`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2 at the start of the next iteration. However, since `i` will now equal `k`, the loop will not execute again after this iteration.

Therefore, the only states that need to be adjusted are `i`, which should become 2 for the next iteration, while the other states remain unchanged.

State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is 2, `dp[n, k]` is -639, `i` is 2**
