Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle all cases correctly. For example, consider the input:

```
zzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzzz
```

In this case, the string consists of all 'z' characters. The program would attempt to replace 'a' with 'b', but since there is no 'a' in the string, it won't be able to start creating the subsequence 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. As a result, it would end up printing `-1`, which is incorrect because it is indeed impossible to form the required subsequence from a string of 'z's. However, the output should be `-1` which is correct, but the logic fails for other cases where it might not fully utilize the available characters.

Additionally, the program does not check if it can form the entire alphabet by properly verifying subsequences. The program also has a flaw in its logic where it might not properly account for the case of multiple characters and their transformations. 

Thus, due to these potential issues and incorrect assumptions made in the logic, the program is deemed incorrect.
