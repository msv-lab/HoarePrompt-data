Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` consisting of lowercase English letters and checks if it contains all the letters of the English alphabet (from 'a' to 'z') in order. If it does, it prints the entire alphabet; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not handle cases where `s` is empty or where `s` contains fewer than 26 characters, which will result in printing -1.**
