The variable `res` is assigned an empty string. The previous values of the affected variables are `s`, which is a string consisting of small English letters, and `alphabet`, which is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. The assignment of an empty string to `res` does not change the values of `s` and `alphabet`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `res` is an empty string.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `res` is an empty string**
