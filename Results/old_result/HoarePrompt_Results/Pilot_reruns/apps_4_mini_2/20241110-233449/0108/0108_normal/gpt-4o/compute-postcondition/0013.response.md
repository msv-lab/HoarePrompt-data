Postcondition: ***`i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, `target_len` is greater than `j`, and if the character at index `i` of string `s` matches the character at index `j` of the target, then `j` is also increased by 1. If there is no match, `j` remains unchanged while retaining the conditions that `len(s)` is greater than `i` and `target_len` is greater than `j`.***
