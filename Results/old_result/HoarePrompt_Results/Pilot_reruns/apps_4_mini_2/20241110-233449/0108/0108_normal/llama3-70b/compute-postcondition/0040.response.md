Postcondition: ***`res` is a string formed by concatenating each character from `s` for every occurrence of that character until it is no longer present, with characters being replaced by their next ASCII character in `s`. If `len(res)` equals 26, `print(res)` outputs the current value of `res`. If `len(res)` is not 26, `res` remains unchanged, with `s` also remaining unchanged, and `print(-1)` is executed. If `s` does not contain any characters from the alphabet, `res` remains unchanged. Characters in `s` that are not in the alphabet are unaffected, and if `s` is empty, `res` remains an empty string. All edge cases regarding the presence of alphabet characters in `s` and the length of `res` are covered.***
