The code `res += char` appends the value of `char` to `res`. However, the value of `char` is not specified in the initial state. Since `res` is stated to be unchanged, we cannot determine its new value after the operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s` includes 'b', `res` is unchanged, and we append the value of `char` to `res`.

Output State: **`s` includes 'b', `res` is unchanged, and we append the value of `char` to `res`**
