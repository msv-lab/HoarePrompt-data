Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; and `j` is less than 26. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is increased by 1; otherwise, `j` remains unchanged. This ensures that `j` will only increment if the corresponding characters match, and it will not exceed 25, maintaining the constraints on `j`.***
