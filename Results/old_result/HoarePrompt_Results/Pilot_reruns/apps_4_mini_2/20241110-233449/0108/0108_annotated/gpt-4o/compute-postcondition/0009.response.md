Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` matches the character at index `j` of `target`, then `j` is increased by 1. If the character does not match, `j` remains unchanged. The value of `j` can range from its initial value to a maximum of 26, depending on how many characters match in sequence from `s` and `target`.***
