To evaluate the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze the logic based on the requirements.

### Problem Breakdown:
1. **Sequence Definition**: The sequence starts with `a` and each subsequent element increases by `c`.
2. **Target Check**: The program needs to check if `b` appears in this infinite sequence based on the rules provided.

### Program Logic:
- If `c == 0`: 
  - The sequence does not change and remains constant at `a`. Therefore, if `a` is equal to `b`, the answer should be "YES"; otherwise, "NO".
  
- If `c != 0`: 
  - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0` to determine if `b` can be reached by adding multiples of `c` to `a`.
  - It also checks if `(b - a) / c >= 0` to ensure that the number of steps taken (if `c > 0`, we can only reach `b` if it is greater than or equal to `a`, and if `c < 0`, we can only reach `b` if it is less than or equal to `a`).

### Edge Cases:
1. **Case with c = 0**: 
   - `a = 10, b = 5, c = 0` should return "NO" because `b` cannot be reached (the sequence remains constant at 10).
   
2. **Case with c > 0**:
   - If `a = 1`, `b = 7`, `c = 3`, the sequence is `1, 4, 7, 10, ...`, hence it correctly returns "YES".
   - If `a = 1`, `b = 5`, `c = 3`, the sequence is `1, 4, 7, ...` and it should return "NO" as `5` is not in the sequence.

3. **Case with c < 0**:
   - If `a = 10`, `b = 5`, `c = -2`, the sequence is `10, 8, 6, 4, ...`, so it should return "YES".

### Analysis:
Upon reviewing the program logic and potential edge cases, we notice:

- The program correctly identifies when `b` is equal to `a` or if it can be reached by the sequence when `c` is not zero.
- The checks for `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0` correctly account for the possibility of `c` being positive or negative.

### Conclusion:
The program handles all edge cases outlined correctly and meets the requirements of the problem description. 

Correctness: **True**.
