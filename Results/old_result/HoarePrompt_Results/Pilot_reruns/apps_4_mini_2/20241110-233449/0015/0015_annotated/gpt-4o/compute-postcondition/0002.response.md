The code executes a print statement that outputs 'NO'. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their values from input, and their state is not altered by the print statement. Therefore, the output state indicates the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are unchanged, and 'NO' has been printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned the values of three integers from input, and 'NO' has been printed**.
