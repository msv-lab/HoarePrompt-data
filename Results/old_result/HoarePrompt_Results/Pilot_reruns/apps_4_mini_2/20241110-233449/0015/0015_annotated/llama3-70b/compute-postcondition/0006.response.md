Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range of -10^9 to 10^9. If `(b - a) % c` equals 0 and `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, then 'YES' is printed, indicating that the difference between `b` and `a` is a multiple of `c` and that the result of the division is non-negative. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, indicating that either the difference is not a multiple of `c` or the division yields a negative result. This covers cases where `c` is positive, negative, or zero (with appropriate considerations for division by zero).***
