To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, we need to analyze both the logic of the code and the edge cases mentioned in the annotations.

### Problem Description:
We need to determine if Vasya's favorite number `b` appears in the sequence defined by:
- The first element `s_1 = a`
- The difference between consecutive elements `c`.

The sequence can be described as:
- `s_i = a + (i - 1) * c` for positive integers `i`.

We need to check if there exists a positive integer `i` such that `s_i = b`, which translates to checking if:
1. If `c == 0`: 
   - If `a == b`, print "YES".
   - Otherwise, print "NO".
   
2. If `c != 0`:
   - Check if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`. This means:
     - The difference `(b - a)` must be a multiple of `c`.
     - The result of `(b - a) / c` must be non-negative, ensuring that `b` can be reached from `a` by adding multiples of `c`.

### Code Analysis:
1. **Case when `c == 0`**:
   - If `a == b`, it correctly prints "YES".
   - If `a != b`, it correctly prints "NO".
   
   This part is correct as it handles the zero difference case accurately.

2. **Case when `c != 0`**:
   - It checks `(b - a) % c == 0`: This correctly verifies if the difference is a multiple of `c`.
   - It checks `(b - a) / c >= 0`: This ensures that we are moving in the right direction (toward `b`).

   This part is also correct, as it logically checks the conditions needed for `b` to be part of the sequence.

### Annotations Validation:
The annotations provide insights into the states of the program and help clarify the behavior in edge cases:
- They confirm that when `c == 0`, the program checks only for the equality of `a` and `b`.
- They also affirm that for non-zero `c`, both modular arithmetic and sign checks are applied correctly.

### Testing Edge Cases:
1. **Case 1**: Input `1 7 3`
   - Output: "YES" (Correctly finds `7` in the sequence generated by `1 + 3*(2) = 7`).
  
2. **Case 2**: Input `10 10 0`
   - Output: "YES" (Correct, since `a` equals `b`).
   
3. **Case 3**: Input `1 -4 5`
   - Output: "NO" (Correct, as the sequence progresses positively from `1`).
   
4. **Case 4**: Input `0 60 50`
   - Output: "NO" (Correct, since all sequence values are multiples of `50` and greater than `60`).

### Conclusion:
The program behaves correctly for all tested cases, and the logic used in the code adheres strictly to the problem description across all potential cases, including edge cases.

Correctness: **True** 

The program accurately determines if `b` appears in the sequence generated by `a` and `c` as defined, and the annotations support this conclusion without introducing any discrepancies.
