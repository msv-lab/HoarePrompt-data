The code prints 'NO' to the output. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print operation was executed, and the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are still as assigned.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned integer values from input, and 'NO' is printed**
