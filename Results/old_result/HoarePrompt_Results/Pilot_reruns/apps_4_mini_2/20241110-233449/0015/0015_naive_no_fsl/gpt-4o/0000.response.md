Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle all cases, specifically when the common difference `c` is negative. 

For example, consider the input:
```
a = 7
b = 1
c = -2
```
In this case, the sequence generated would be:
```
7, 5, 3, 1, ...
```
Here, `b` (which is 1) is indeed in the sequence, so the output should be "YES". However, the program would evaluate `(b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0`. 

Calculating:
- `b - a` = 1 - 7 = -6
- `c` = -2

The expression `(-6) % (-2)` is `0`, and `(-6) / (-2)` is `3`, which is greater than `0`. Therefore, it will print "YES", which is correct in this case.

However, if we consider another case where `b` is less than `a` and `c` is also negative, for example:
```
a = 5
b = 1
c = -2
```
The sequence becomes:
```
5, 3, 1, -1, ...
```
In this case, `b` (which is 1) is again present in the sequence, and the output should be "YES". But if we check again, it would still print "YES".

Now, let's consider the case where `c` is `0` and `a` is not equal to `b`. For instance:
```
a = 5
b = 3
c = 0
```
The sequence is constant at `5`, and since `b` is not equal to `a`, it should print "NO". The program does handle this case correctly.

However, for the case of `c < 0` and `b < a`, the program fails to correctly determine if `b` is in the sequence since it fails to check the decreasing sequences properly. 

Thus, the program's logic fails when analyzing negative steps in the sequence, and it does not comprehensively cover all possible input scenarios as described in the problem statement.

Hence, the program does not meet the requirements in the problem description for every potential case.
