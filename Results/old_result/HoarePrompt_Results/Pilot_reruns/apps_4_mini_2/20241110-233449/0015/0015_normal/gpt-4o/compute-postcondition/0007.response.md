Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `b` equals `a`, the output is 'YES'. If `c` equals 0, the output is 'NO'. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO'. This encompasses all cases, including situations where `c` is positive, negative, or zero, and where `b` equals `a`.***
