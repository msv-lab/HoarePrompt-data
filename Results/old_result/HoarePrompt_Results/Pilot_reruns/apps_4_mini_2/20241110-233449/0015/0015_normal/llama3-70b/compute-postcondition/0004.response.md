The code executes a print statement that outputs 'YES'. The values of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged, as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, while also noting the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values based on user input, and 'YES' is printed**.
