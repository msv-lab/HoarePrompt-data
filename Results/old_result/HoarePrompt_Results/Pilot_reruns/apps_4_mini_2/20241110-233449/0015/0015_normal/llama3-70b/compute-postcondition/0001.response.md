The function will print 'YES', but the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged as the print statement does not modify any variables. Therefore, the output state is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values based on user input, and the function prints 'YES'.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned new integer values based on user input, and the function prints 'YES'**.
