Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs from the user, `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b`, printing 'YES' if they are equal and 'NO' otherwise. If `c` is not 0, it checks if the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and if the result of `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, printing 'YES' if both conditions are satisfied; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not return any values. **
