Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers. If `c` is equal to 0, the function prints 'NO'. If the difference `(b - a)` is divisible by `c` and `(b - a) / c` is non-negative, the function prints 'YES'. Otherwise, the function prints 'NO'. This covers scenarios where `c` might be positive, negative, or zero, including cases where `b` is equal to `a`, which would lead to a division of zero or a non-negative result.***
