The code executes a print statement that outputs 'YES'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not modified by this operation, and their specific values remain as integers assigned from input. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the variables and the printed output.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned new values from input, and 'YES' is printed**
