Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum total number of fruits (lemons, apples, and pears) Nikolay can use to make the compote in the specified ratio of 1:2:4. 

Here's how it works:

1. It reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from input.
2. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be used by finding the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`).
   - Half of the number of apples available (`b // 2`) since each lemon requires 2 apples.
   - A quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`) since each lemon requires 4 pears.
3. This maximum number of lemons (`max_lemons`) is then used to calculate the total number of fruits in the ratio defined (1 lemon + 2 apples + 4 pears).
4. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits that can be used.

The program handles edge cases correctly:
- If there are no sufficient pears, it will return 0 as expected.
- The calculations ensure that the ratio is maintained, and only whole fruits are counted.

Examples from the problem statement confirm that the output matches the expected results. Therefore, there are no potential cases where the program would fail to meet the requirements of the problem description.
