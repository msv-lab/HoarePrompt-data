Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers through user input: `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be made based on the constraints of `a`, half of `b`, and a quarter of `c`. The total number of fruits is then calculated as seven times the maximum number of lemons, which is printed as the output. The function does not handle cases where the inputs are not positive integers, nor does it validate the input range.**
