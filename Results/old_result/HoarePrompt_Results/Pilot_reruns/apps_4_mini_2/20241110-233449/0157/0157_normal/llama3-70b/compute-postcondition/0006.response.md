Functionality: ** The function prompts the user to input three integers: `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates the minimum value among `a`, half of `b`, and a quarter of `c`, assigns this value to `min_lemon`, and then prints the result of the expression `min_lemon * 7`. The function does not return any values, and there are no error handling mechanisms for invalid inputs such as non-integer values. **
