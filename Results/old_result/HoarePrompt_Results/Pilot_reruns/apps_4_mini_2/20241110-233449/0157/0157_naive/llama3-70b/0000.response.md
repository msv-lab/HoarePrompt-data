Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits that Nikolay can use to prepare the compote based on the given ratios of lemons, apples, and pears. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. **Input handling**: The program reads three integers from input, which represent the counts of lemons (a), apples (b), and pears (c).

2. **Ratio calculation**: The program determines how many complete sets of the required ratio can be made by calculating `min_lemon = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This effectively finds the limiting factor based on the number of lemons available, the number of apples (which must be twice the number of lemons), and the number of pears (which must be four times the number of lemons).

3. **Total calculation**: The total number of fruits used in the compote is then calculated as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which translates to the total number of lemons, apples, and pears used based on the maximum number of complete sets that can be formed.

4. **Edge cases**: The program correctly handles the edge case when there aren't enough fruits to form any complete set (i.e., when `min_lemon` is zero), leading to an output of 0, which is specified in the problem description.

Overall, the logic implemented in the program satisfies the requirements laid out in the problem description for all potential inputs in the specified range.
