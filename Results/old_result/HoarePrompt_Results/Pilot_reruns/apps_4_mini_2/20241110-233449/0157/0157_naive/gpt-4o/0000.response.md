To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's break down the requirements and the provided solution.

**Problem Description Recap:**
- Nikolay has `a` lemons, `b` apples, and `c` pears.
- The fruits should be used in the ratio 1:2:4 (lemons:apples:pears).
- We need to determine the maximum total number of fruits that can be used to make the compote, adhering strictly to that ratio.

**Program Analysis:**
```python
a = int(input())
b = int(input())
c = int(input())
max_lemons = min(a, b // 2, c // 4)
total_fruits = max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4
print(total_fruits)
```

1. **Input Reading:** The program reads three integers representing the number of lemons, apples, and pears.
2. **Calculate Maximum Lemons:** 
   - `max_lemons` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`. This correctly ensures that:
     - For every lemon, there are enough apples (hence `b // 2`).
     - For every lemon, there are enough pears (hence `c // 4`).
3. **Total Fruits Calculation:** 
   - The total number of fruits used is calculated as `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`, which simplifies to `max_lemons * 7`. Thus, the total count is correctly calculated based on the number of lemons used.

**Edge Cases to Consider:**
- If `a`, `b`, or `c` is not sufficient to meet the ratio requirements, the program should correctly return `0`.
- For example, if `a = 0`, `b = 1`, `c = 1`, the output should be `0` since no lemons are available.
- If there are enough lemons but not enough apples or pears, the program should also return `0`.

**Potential Case to Test:**
- Let's test with a case where:
  - `a = 1`, `b = 1`, `c = 1` should return `0` because there aren't enough apples or pears.
  
Since the program reads inputs and calculates `max_lemons` correctly, it would yield:
- `max_lemons = min(1, 1 // 2, 1 // 4) = min(1, 0, 0) = 0`
- `total_fruits = 0 * 7 = 0`, which is the expected output.

After considering various cases including edge cases, the program correctly handles all scenarios as required by the problem description.

**Final Conclusion:**
Correctness: **True**. 

The program accurately calculates the maximum total number of fruits based on the given ratios and handles edge cases properly.
