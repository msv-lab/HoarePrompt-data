Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers as input, computes the minimum of the first integer, half of the second integer, and a quarter of the third integer, and then prints the result of multiplying this minimum value by 7. The function does not return any value. It is assumed that the inputs are positive integers, but it does not handle any invalid inputs or edge cases such as negative values or non-integer inputs. **
