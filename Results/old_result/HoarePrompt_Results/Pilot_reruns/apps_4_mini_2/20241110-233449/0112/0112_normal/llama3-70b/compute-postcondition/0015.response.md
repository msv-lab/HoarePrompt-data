The function `func` does not accept any parameters directly as input. Instead, it operates on a predetermined structure that consists of an integer `n` and a subsequent set of integers organized in lines. Specifically, `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and for each of the `n` lines, it contains 6 integers `a_{i}_{j}` where 0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9. The function processes this input structure, but the exact output based on the processing is not specified in the provided information. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to handle structured input without accepting parameters in the conventional manner.

Functionality: **The function does not accept parameters directly but processes structured input consisting of an integer n (1 ≤ n ≤ 3) followed by n lines of 6 integers each (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9). The output of the function is not specified.**
