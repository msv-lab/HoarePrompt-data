According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the integer `n`. The loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1.

Since `n` is at least 1, the loop can execute again. The current conditions indicate that `used_cubes`, `found`, and `digits` remain unchanged.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes` is unchanged, `digits` is unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is 1**
