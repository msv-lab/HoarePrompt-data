Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and reads `n` lines of integers (each containing 6 integers). It collects all unique digits from these integers, removes '0' if present, and constructs the largest possible integer by sorting the remaining digits in descending order. The function then prints this maximum number. If all digits are '0', it will print an empty string (though the specific handling of this case isn't explicitly mentioned in the annotations). **
