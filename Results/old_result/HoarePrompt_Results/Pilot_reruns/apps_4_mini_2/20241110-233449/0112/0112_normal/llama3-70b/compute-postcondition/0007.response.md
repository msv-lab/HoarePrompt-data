According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 3 sublists, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 2 sublists, `cube` is the second sublist in `cubes`, and `n` is at least 2. 

For the loop to be executed one more time, `cubes` must have at least 3 sublists, and `cube` should be the third sublist in the list. Additionally, the `digits` variable should be updated to include string representations of integers from the new `cube`.

State: **`n` is at least 3; `cubes` is a list of at least 3 sublists populated with integers; `cube` is the third sublist in `cubes`; `digits` is updated to include string representations of integers from `cube`.**
