The variable `used_cubes[i]` is assigned the value `True`. Given that `i` is 0, this means that the first element of the list `used_cubes` (which is of length `n`, where `1 ≤ n ≤ 3`) will be changed from `False` to `True`. The other variables (`n`, `digits`, `found`, and `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state will reflect the change in the `used_cubes` list.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list with the first element set to True and the rest unchanged; `digits` is a list with at least 1 element; `found` is False; `i` is 0**
