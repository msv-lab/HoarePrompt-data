Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `num` and checks if all its digits can be matched to available cube faces. It returns `True` if all digits can be matched without reusing any cube, and `False` if any digit cannot be matched to the available cube faces. The variable `n` should be defined before this function is called, and there is no handling for cases where `n` is less than 1 or greater than 3, which could lead to an error. Additionally, `cube_faces` should be defined as it is referenced but not passed as a parameter. **
