`used_cubes` is assigned a list of `False` values, with the length equal to `n`. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `used_cubes` will be a list containing either one, two, or three `False` values. The `digits` variable remains unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` filled with `False`**
