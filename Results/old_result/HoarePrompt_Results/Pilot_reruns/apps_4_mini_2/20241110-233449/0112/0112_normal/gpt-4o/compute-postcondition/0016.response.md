The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. Since `found` was already `True`, its value remains unchanged. The other variables (`n`, `used_cubes[i]`, `digits`, and `i`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digits` remains unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is equal to the last value of `i` (which is less than `n`.**
