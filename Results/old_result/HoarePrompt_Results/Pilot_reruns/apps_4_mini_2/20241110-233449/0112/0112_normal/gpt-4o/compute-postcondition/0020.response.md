Output State: **`used_cubes` will have the first element set to True if `not used_cubes[0]` is True and `digit` is present in `cube_faces[0]`, otherwise it remains unchanged; `found` is True if a match was found in any iteration; `digits` remains unchanged; `i` will be 0, 1, or 2 depending on the iteration; if the loop doesn't execute (for example, if all `used_cubes[i]` are True or if `digit` is not in any of `cube_faces[i]`), then `used_cubes` remains unchanged, `found` is still False, and `i` remains 0.**
