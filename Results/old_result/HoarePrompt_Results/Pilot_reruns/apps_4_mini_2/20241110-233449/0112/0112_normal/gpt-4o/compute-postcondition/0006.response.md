The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The previous value of `found` was `False`, so it changes to `True`. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list with the first element set to True and the rest unchanged; `digits` is a list with at least 1 element; `found` is True; `i` is 0.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3; `used_cubes` is a list with the first element set to True and the rest unchanged; `digits` is a list with at least 1 element; `found` is True; `i` is 0**
