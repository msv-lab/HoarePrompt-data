Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer input `n` (where 1 ≤ n ≤ 3) and reads `n` lists of integers (cubes). It collects all unique digits found in these lists, removes '0' if present, and constructs the largest possible integer by sorting the remaining digits in descending order. Finally, it prints this integer. If no digits are found (e.g., all inputs are 0), the function will print 0. **
