According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. If there are more lists in `cubes`, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` has at least 2 lists, and `cube` is the second list in the `cubes`. For the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must have at least 3 lists, and `cube` must be the third list in `cubes`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 3 lists, `cube` is the third list in `cubes`, `digits` is updated with the string representations of each digit in `cube`.**
