The code initializes a list `used_cubes` with a length of `n`, where each element is set to `False`. The value of `n` can be 1, 2, or 3. Thus, the resulting list will have either 1, 2, or 3 elements, all set to `False`. The other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters representing the string version of `num`; `used_cubes` is a list of length `n` containing `False` values.**
