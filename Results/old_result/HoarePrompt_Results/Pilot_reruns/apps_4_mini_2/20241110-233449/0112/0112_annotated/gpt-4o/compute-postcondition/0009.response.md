According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. Given that at the end of the last iteration `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and since the loop iterates over `range(n)`, it can execute multiple times based on the value of `n`.

Since `n` can be at most 3 and the loop has executed at least once, `i` will have been incremented. Therefore, at the end of the last iteration, `i` must be at least 1 (the loop starts from 0). 

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n`. Thus, if `n` is 1, the loop cannot execute again; if `n` is 2, `i` is 1; and if `n` is 3, `i` can be 1 or 2. Therefore, we can conclude that for the loop to execute one more time, `n` must be at least 2.

So, adjusting the states accordingly:

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character, `i` is 1**
