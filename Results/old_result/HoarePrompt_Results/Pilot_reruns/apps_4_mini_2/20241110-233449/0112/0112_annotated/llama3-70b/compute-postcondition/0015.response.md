The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly as per the provided signature. However, it operates based on certain constraints: `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, and each cube is represented as a list of 6 integers where each integer is between 0 and 9. 

The output of the function is not specified in detail, but it can be inferred that it processes the cubes based on the defined constraints. 

Since the exact return values or behavior are not provided in the output description, we can summarize the functionality based on the constraints given. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to process `n` cubes (with each cube being a list of 6 integers between 0 and 9) and return values based on the internal logic which is not specified.

Functionality: **The function processes `n` cubes, where `n` is an integer between 1 and 3, and each cube is represented as a list of 6 integers (each between 0 and 9). The specific return values are not detailed.**
