Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3; `digits` is a list of characters with at least 1 character; `i` is 1; if `used_cubes[1]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[1]`, then `used_cubes[1]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `used_cubes[1]` is already True or `digit` is not in `cube_faces[1]`, there are no changes to `used_cubes[1]` and `found`.***
