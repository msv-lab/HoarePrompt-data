According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. The loop will execute as long as there are more lists in `cubes` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, which implies that there is at least one list in `cubes`. Since `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `cubes` has at least 2 lists. This means `n` needs to be adjusted to 2 or more, and since `cube` is the first element, we can assume it has been processed, so it should be updated to the second list in `cubes`. 

State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cubes` is a list of lists of integers with at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, and `digits` is updated with the string representations of each digit in `cube`.**
