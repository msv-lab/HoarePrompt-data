The variables `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values through the `map(int, input().split())` function, which takes input as a string, splits it into separate values, and converts them into integers. However, since the specific input values are not provided, we cannot determine the exact new values of `x`, `y`, and `z`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated based on the input.

Therefore, the output state is that `x`, `y`, and `z` are now integers based on user input, while the previous values remain unknown.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on user input**
