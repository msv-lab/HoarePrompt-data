The function `func` does not accept any parameters explicitly in the provided definition. However, it operates under the constraints that `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers, each within the range of 0 to 100. The output of the function is not specified in the prompt. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value or behavior of the function without further information on its implementation or output conditions.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, and its output is undefined based on the provided information.**
