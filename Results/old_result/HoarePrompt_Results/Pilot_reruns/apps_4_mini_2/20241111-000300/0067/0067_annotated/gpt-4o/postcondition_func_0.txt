The function accepts three integers as input via user input: `x`, `y`, and `z`. It calculates `min_upvotes` as `x`, `max_upvotes` as `x + z`, `min_downvotes` as `y`, and `max_downvotes` as `y + z`. It then compares these values to print '-' if `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`, '+' if `max_downvotes` is less than `min_upvotes`, or '?' otherwise. This includes scenarios where the maximum upvotes and downvotes are equal to their respective minimums, which results in a '?' being printed.
