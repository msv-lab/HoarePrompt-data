Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers based on user input. If the maximum upvotes (`x + z`) are less than the minimum downvotes (`y`), the function prints '-'. If the maximum downvotes (`y + z`) are less than the minimum upvotes (`x`), the function prints '+'. In all other cases, including when the maximum downvotes are equal to or greater than the minimum upvotes and when the maximum upvotes are equal to the minimum downvotes, the function prints '?'.***
