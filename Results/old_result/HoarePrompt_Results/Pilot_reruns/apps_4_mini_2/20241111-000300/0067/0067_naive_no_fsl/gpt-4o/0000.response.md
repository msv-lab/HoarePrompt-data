To verify the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the logic and see if it accounts for all potential cases.

### Problem Understanding:
1. We have three types of voters:
   - `x`: certain upvotes
   - `y`: certain downvotes
   - `z`: uncertain votes (could be either upvotes or downvotes)
   
2. The output should be:
   - "+" if upvotes exceed downvotes in all scenarios.
   - "-" if downvotes exceed upvotes in all scenarios.
   - "0" if upvotes equal downvotes in all scenarios.
   - "?" if there are multiple possible outcomes depending on the votes of the uncertain voters.

### Program Logic:
The program computes:
- `min_upvotes` = `x` (minimum upvotes, as all uncertain votes could be downvotes)
- `max_upvotes` = `x + z` (maximum upvotes, as all uncertain votes could be upvotes)
- `min_downvotes` = `y` (minimum downvotes)
- `max_downvotes` = `y + z` (maximum downvotes)

It then evaluates:
- If `max_upvotes < min_downvotes`: Always more downvotes, so output '-'.
- If `max_downvotes < min_upvotes`: Always more upvotes, so output '+'.
- Otherwise, if neither condition is met, the result is uncertain, so output '?'.

### Test Cases:
Let's evaluate a few test cases to ensure the program handles them correctly:

1. **Test Case: `3 7 0`**
   - Upvotes = 3, Downvotes = 7 (no uncertain votes)
   - Always more downvotes, expected output: '-'.
   - Program output: '-'. (Correct)

2. **Test Case: `2 0 1`**
   - Upvotes = 2, Downvotes = 0, uncertain votes = 1
   - Minimum downvotes = 0, maximum upvotes = 3 (if the uncertain vote is an upvote)
   - Always more upvotes than downvotes regardless of uncertain vote, expected output: '+'.
   - Program output: '+'. (Correct)

3. **Test Case: `1 1 0`**
   - Upvotes = 1, Downvotes = 1 (no uncertain votes)
   - Equal upvotes and downvotes, expected output: '0'.
   - Program output: '0'. (Correct)

4. **Test Case: `0 0 1`**
   - Upvotes = 0, Downvotes = 0, uncertain = 1
   - Possible outcomes: one uncertain vote can either make it '+' or '-'.
   - Expected output: '?'
   - Program output: '?'. (Correct)

5. **Additional Case: `5 3 4`**
   - Upvotes = 5, Downvotes = 3, uncertain = 4
   - Minimum downvotes = 3, maximum upvotes = 9 (if all uncertain are upvotes)
   - Minimum upvotes = 5, maximum downvotes = 7 (if all uncertain are downvotes)
   - Possible outcomes: upvotes could be between 5 and 9, downvotes could be between 3 and 7, so:
     - If all uncertain are downvotes: Upvotes = 5, Downvotes = 7 => "-"
     - If all uncertain are upvotes: Upvotes = 9, Downvotes = 3 => "+"
   - Expected output: '?'
   - Program output: '?'. (Correct)

### Conclusion:
The program correctly accounts for all potential cases outlined in the problem description. Each test case returns the expected output based on the defined conditions. 

Thus, the final conclusion regarding the program's correctness is:

Correctness: **True**
