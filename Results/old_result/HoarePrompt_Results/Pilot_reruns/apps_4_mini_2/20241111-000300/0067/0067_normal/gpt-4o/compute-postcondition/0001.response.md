The variable `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`. The initial state specifies that `x` is an integer within the range of 0 to 100, but the specific value of `x` is not provided. Therefore, the output state will indicate that `min_upvotes` takes the value of `x` while the states of `y` and `z` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer (0 <= z <= 100); `min_upvotes` is `x`**
