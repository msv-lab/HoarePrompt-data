The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The previous state shows that `y` is an integer within the range (0 <= y <= 100). This assignment does not affect the values of `x`, `z`, `min_upvotes`, or `max_upvotes`. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `min_downvotes` while keeping the other variables unchanged.

Output State: **`x` is an integer (0 <= x <= 100), `y` is an integer (0 <= y <= 100), `z` is an integer (0 <= z <= 100); `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`**
