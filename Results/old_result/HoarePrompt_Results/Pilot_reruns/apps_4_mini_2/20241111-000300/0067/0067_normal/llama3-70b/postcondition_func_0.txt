The function accepts three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` through input, and prints one of the following based on their values: if `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, it prints '+'; if `x` is less than `y`, it prints '-'; if `x` is equal to `y`, it checks `z`: if `z` is 0, it prints '0'; if `z` is greater than 0, it prints '?'. If none of these conditions are met, it also prints '?'. The function does not return any value and handles cases where `x`, `y`, and `z` are all in the range of 0 to 100 inclusive.
