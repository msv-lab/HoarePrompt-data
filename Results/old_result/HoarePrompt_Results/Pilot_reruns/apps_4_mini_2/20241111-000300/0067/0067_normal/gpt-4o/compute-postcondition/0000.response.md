The code assigns values to `x`, `y`, and `z` by taking input and mapping it to integers. The previous values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are overridden by the input values. Since the input values are not specified, we cannot determine the new values of `x`, `y`, and `z` after execution.

Therefore, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, and they are assigned new values based on input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100, and they are assigned new values based on input.**
