According to the code, the loop iterates over the string `s`. For the loop to execute, `s` must contain at least one character. Since `t` is a non-empty substring of `s`, this ensures that `s` is not empty, so the loop can execute. At the beginning of the loop, we need to establish that `c` will start with the first character of `s`. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `s` is a string of digits with a length greater than 0.
- `c` is the first character of `s`.

State: **`s` is a string of digits with a length greater than 0, `c` is the first character of `s`**
