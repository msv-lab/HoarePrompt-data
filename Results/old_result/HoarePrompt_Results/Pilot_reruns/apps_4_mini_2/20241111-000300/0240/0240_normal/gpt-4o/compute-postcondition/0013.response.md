Output State: **If `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, then each `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, and each `candidate` is a string formed from `perm`. If `candidate` is valid according to `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, it is yielded. If `chars` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no permutations are generated, resulting in no yielded candidates. If `chars` contains only one digit, the loop executes only once, yielding that single digit if it satisfies the validity check. If all permutations are invalid, no candidates are yielded even if the loop executes.**
