The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the characters in the string `perm`. Since `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will now hold that specific permutation as a string. The other variables (`chars` and `perm`) remain unchanged.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the third permutation of `chars` as a string**.
