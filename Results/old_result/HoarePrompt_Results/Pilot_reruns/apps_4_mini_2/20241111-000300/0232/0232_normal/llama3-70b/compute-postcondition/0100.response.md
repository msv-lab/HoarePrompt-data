Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where `window_counts[color]` is set to 0 if `color` was not previously a key in `window_counts`. The `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, and `j` is 3, with `color` assigned the value of `colors[3]`. If `color` was already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
