Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`. If the sorted values of `window_counts` match the `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the counts do not match, `found` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing subsequent code without breaking.***
