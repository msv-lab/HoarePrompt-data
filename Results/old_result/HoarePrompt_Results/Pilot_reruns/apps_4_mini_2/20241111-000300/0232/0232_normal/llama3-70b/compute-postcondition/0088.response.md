Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that includes the entry `{color: 1}` if `color` was not already present; otherwise, it remains unchanged. `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop is exited. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged.***
