Output State: **`window_counts` is a dictionary that includes the entry `{color: 1}` if `color` was not already present in it; otherwise, `window_counts` remains unchanged, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`, `found` is set to True, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
