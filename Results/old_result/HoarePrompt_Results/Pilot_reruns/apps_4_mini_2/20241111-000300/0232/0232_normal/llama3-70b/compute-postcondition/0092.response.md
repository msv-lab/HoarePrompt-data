Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that remains unchanged unless `color` was not already present, in which case `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 2, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, it remains unchanged.***
