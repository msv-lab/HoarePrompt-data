Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with counts of each integer from `colors`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`, with `window_counts[color]` increased by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` sorted by value match the corresponding counts in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop. If the counts do not match, `found` remains unchanged and the loop continues.***
