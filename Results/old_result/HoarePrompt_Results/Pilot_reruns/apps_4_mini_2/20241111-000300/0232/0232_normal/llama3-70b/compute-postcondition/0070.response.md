Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary with the counts of each integer from `colors`, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
