The statement `window_counts[color] = 0` sets the value of `window_counts[color]` to 0. The previous value of `window_counts[color]` has been incremented by 1, but we do not know what that value was, so it is irrelevant to the current operation. Other variables, including `color_counts`, `i`, `n`, `j`, and `color`, remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects that `window_counts[color]` has been reset to 0.

Output State: **`window_counts[color]` is set to 0, `color_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 3, `j` is 3, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[3]**
