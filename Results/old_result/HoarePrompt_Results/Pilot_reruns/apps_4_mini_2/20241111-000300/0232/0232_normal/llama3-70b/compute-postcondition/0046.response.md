Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary with the counts of each integer from `colors`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. If `j` is less than `n` and all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts`, then `found` will be set to True, and the loop will break. If the loop does not execute (e.g., if `n` is 0), `found` remains False, `i` is 0, and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary. If there are any mismatches in counts during the loop execution, `found` remains unchanged.**
