Postcondition: ***`color_counts` is a dictionary where keys are unique integers from the `colors` list and values are the counts of each integer, `found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` either has `color` as a key with value 0 if it was not previously present, or remains unchanged if `color` was already in `window_counts`. Additionally, `j` is 0, and `color` is the value at index `j` of the `colors` list.***
