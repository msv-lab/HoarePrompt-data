The value of `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If `color` was not already a key in `color_counts`, it was initialized with a value of 0 before this operation. Therefore, after this operation, `color_counts[color]` will have a value of 1 if it was previously 0 or will be incremented by 1 if it was already greater than 0. The states of other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `color` is the first integer in the list, and `color_counts[color]` is incremented by 1**
