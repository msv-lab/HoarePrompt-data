Postcondition: ***`window_counts` has been updated for `color`, `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
