Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `n` and `m`, followed by two lists: `colors` and `counts`. It checks if there exists a contiguous subarray in `colors` that contains the exact count of each distinct color as specified in `counts`. If such a subarray exists, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The function does not handle cases where the input sizes are invalid or where counts do not match the distinct colors present in the input. Additionally, since the counts are checked against sorted values, it may not account for cases where colors have the same count but different color identifiers.**
