The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The other variables remain unchanged: `window_counts` is still an empty dictionary, `i` is unchanged, `j` remains equal to `i`, and `n` is still greater than `i`. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in the `found` variable while the others remain as they were.

Output State: **`window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, `found` is True, `i` is unchanged, `j` is equal to `i`, and `n` is greater than `i`**
