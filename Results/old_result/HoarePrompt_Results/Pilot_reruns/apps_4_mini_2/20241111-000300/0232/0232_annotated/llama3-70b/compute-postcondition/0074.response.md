Postcondition: ***`color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop is exited. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged, and the program continues without breaking out of the loop.***
