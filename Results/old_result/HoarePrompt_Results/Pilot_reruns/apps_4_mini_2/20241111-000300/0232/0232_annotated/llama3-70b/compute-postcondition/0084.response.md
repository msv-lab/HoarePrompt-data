Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary that contains the key `color` assigned the value 0 if `color` was not previously a key in the dictionary. The variables `found`, `i`, and `n` remain unchanged, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` was already a key in `window_counts`, the dictionary remains unchanged.***
