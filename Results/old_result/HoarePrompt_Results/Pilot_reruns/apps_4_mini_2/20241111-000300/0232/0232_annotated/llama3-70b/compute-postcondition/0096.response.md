Postcondition: ***`window_counts` has been updated for `color`, `found` is set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `i` remains unchanged, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is assigned the value from `colors[j]`. If the counts match the targets, the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If they do not match, the program continues without changing the values of `found`, `i`, or `j`.***
