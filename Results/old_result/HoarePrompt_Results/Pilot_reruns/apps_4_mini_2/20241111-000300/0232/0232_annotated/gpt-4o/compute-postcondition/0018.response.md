The code updates the `current_counts` array at the index corresponding to `colors[right]`, incrementing its value by 1. The variable `right` holds the value of `n`, which means `colors[right]` accesses the element at the `n`-th index of `colors`. The values of `current_counts`, `left`, and `right` are affected by this operation.

Since `left` is already incremented and `right` is `n`, we focus on the impact of the line of code. The specific value of `colors[right]` is critical to determine the specific index in `current_counts`.

Thus, the output state reflects that `current_counts` is updated at index `colors[right]`, `left` is incremented (no specific value provided), and `right` is `n`.

Output State: **`current_counts` is updated at index `colors[right]`, `left` is incremented, and `right` is `n`**
