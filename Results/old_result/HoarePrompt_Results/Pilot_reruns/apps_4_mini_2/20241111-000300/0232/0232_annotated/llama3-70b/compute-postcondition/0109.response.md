According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the limit `n`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is equal to or greater than `n`, meaning that the loop will not execute again. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be adjusted to be less than `n`. 

Since `found` and `window_counts` are unchanged from the previous iteration, they do not need to be adjusted.

State: **`i` is less than `n`, `window_counts` remains unchanged, `found` remains unchanged**
