The code assigns an empty dictionary to `window_counts`. Since `window_counts` was initially an empty dictionary, its value remains unchanged. The other variables (`found`, `i`, `j`, `n`) are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state remains the same for those variables.

Output State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is False, `i` is unchanged, `j` is unchanged, `n` is greater than `i`**
