Postcondition: ***`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is set to True if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, while `n` remains greater than 0, and `i` and `j` remain 0. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, and the state of `color_counts`, `n`, `i`, and `j` remains unchanged.***
