Output State: **`color_counts` is a dictionary where each key is a unique color from the `colors` list and its value is the count of occurrences of that color in the list. If `colors` is an empty list, the loop will not execute, and `color_counts` will remain an empty dictionary. If `colors` contains at least one element, `n` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` remains an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, and `counts` remains a list of integers derived from input.**
