Postcondition: ***`window_counts` remains unchanged, `found` remains unchanged, `i` remains unchanged, and `j` is equal to `i + 1`. If `found` is True, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If `n` is equal to `i`, the loop does not execute, resulting in `window_counts` being an empty dictionary, `found` being False, and both `i` and `j` remaining unchanged.***
