The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n + (10 - remainder)`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^9, and the value of `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9. Therefore, `10 - remainder` will be a value between 1 and 10, depending on the value of `remainder`.

The state of `n` and `remainder` does not change, but `result` is now calculated based on their values. Thus, the output state reflects the values of `n`, `remainder`, and the computed `result`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9; `result` is `n + (10 - remainder)`**
