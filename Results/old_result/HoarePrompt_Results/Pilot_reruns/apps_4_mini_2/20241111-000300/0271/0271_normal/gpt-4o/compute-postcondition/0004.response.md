Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is calculated as `n - remainder`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is calculated as `n + (10 - remainder)`. In all cases, the value of `result` is adjusted based on the value of `remainder`, ensuring that it remains within the bounds dictated by the preconditions.***
