The code snippet provided is a `print(result)` statement, which outputs the value of `result`. However, the computation of `result` based on the values of `n` and `remainder` is not included in the snippet. 

Since `result` is calculated based on `n` and `remainder`, we need to consider both conditions for `remainder`:

1. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, then `result` is calculated as `n - remainder`.
2. If `remainder` is greater than 5, then `result` is calculated as `n + (10 - remainder)`.

The output state will depend on the specific value of `n` and `remainder`, which have not been provided, making it impossible to determine the exact value of `result`. Therefore, we can only state that `result` will be printed.

Output State: **`result` will be printed based on the calculations involving `n` and `remainder`**.
