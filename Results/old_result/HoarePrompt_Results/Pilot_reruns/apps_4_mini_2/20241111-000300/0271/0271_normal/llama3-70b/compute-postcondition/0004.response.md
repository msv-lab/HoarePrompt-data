Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; if the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, the output is `n - n % 10`, which rounds down `n` to the nearest multiple of 10. If the last digit of `n` is greater than 5, the output is `n + (10 - n % 10)`, which rounds up `n` to the nearest multiple of 10.***
