Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer. If `n` is a multiple of 10, the function prints `n`. If `n` is not a multiple of 10 and `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, the function prints the nearest lower multiple of 10, which is `n - n % 10`. If `n % 10` is greater than 5, the function prints the next higher multiple of 10, calculated as `n + (10 - n % 10)`. Thus, the program rounds `n` to the nearest multiple of 10, handling all cases including when `n` is negative, zero, or positive.***
