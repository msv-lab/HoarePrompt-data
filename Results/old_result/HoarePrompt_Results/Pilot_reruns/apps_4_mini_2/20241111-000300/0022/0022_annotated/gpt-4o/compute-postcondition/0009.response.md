Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 4, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. If the characters match, the function continues execution without returning False, which implies that the condition for returning False was not met.***
