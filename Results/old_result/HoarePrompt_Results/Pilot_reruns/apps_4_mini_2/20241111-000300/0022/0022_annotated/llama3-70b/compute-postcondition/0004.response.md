The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`, but this does not affect any of the previously defined variables (`s`, `n`, `is_palindrome`, and `i`). Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of the previous variables along with the new value of `is_spalindrome`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 0, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
