According to the code, the for loop continues as long as the condition `i < n // 2` holds true. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, and `n` is at least 2. This means that `n // 2` is at least 1, so the loop can execute again.

For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` will increase by 1 in the next iteration. After the next iteration, `i` will be 1.

The loop will continue to check whether the characters at index `i` of `s` and index `n - i - 1` of `s` are equal until `i` reaches `n // 2`. Since `n` is at least 2, `n // 2` will be at least 1, allowing for at least one more iteration.

Thus, the only adjustment needed is to increment `i` to 1.

State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is 1**
