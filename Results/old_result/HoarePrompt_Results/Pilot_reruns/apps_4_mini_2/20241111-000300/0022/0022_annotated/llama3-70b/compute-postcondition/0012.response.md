The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The previous state of `is_palindrome` is `True`, but `is_spalindrome` is a new variable and does not affect the other variables. No other variables are impacted by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 4, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is at least 1, `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 4, `is_palindrome` is True, `i` is at least 1, `is_spalindrome` is False**
