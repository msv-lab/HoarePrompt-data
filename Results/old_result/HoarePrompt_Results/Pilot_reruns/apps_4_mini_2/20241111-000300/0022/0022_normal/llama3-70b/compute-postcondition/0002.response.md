The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `True`. The previous values of the affected variables are not modified, and `s` retains its string value while `n` remains the length of that string. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n` is the length of `s`; `is_spalindrome` is True.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n` is the length of `s`; `is_spalindrome` is True**
