The variable `is_palindrome` is assigned the value `False`. The previous values of the affected variables are not changed, and the other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `is_palindrome` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1, and `is_palindrome` is False**
