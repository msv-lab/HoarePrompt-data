Output State: **`is_spalindrome` is True if all corresponding characters in the first half of the string `s` and the second half are equal, indicating that `s` is a palindrome. If any pair of corresponding characters are not equal, `is_spalindrome` is set to False, indicating that `s` is not a palindrome. If the string `s` has a length of 1, the loop does not execute and `is_spalindrome` remains True. If `n` is 0 or lower, which is not possible given the constraints, the loop also does not execute.**
