According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is at least 2, which means `n // 2` is at least 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
- `i` should be updated to 2.

The other states do not need to be adjusted because `s` can remain as is and `n` can remain as is since they are sufficient for the next iteration.

State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 2**
