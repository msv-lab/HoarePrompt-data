Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 4, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, the state of `is_spalindrome` remains unchanged, and further checks can continue if applicable.***
