Correctness: False

The provided program is incorrect because it only considers the first tuple element in the tuple and returns the index of that element. However, the problem description states that the function should find the number of elements that occur before the tuple element in the given tuple.

For example:
- Input: (1, 2, 3, (4, 5), 6)
  Output: 3
  Expected Output: 4

This example demonstrates that the program does not work as expected and does not follow the problem description for all potential cases.
