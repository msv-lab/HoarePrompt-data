The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` containing elements, some of which may be tuples. It iterates through the elements and if it encounters a tuple, it returns the index of the first tuple found in `tup`. If no tuples are present in `tup`, it returns the length of the tuple `tup`. However, the function does not handle the case where no tuples are found, but there is a need to return a specific value in that scenario.
