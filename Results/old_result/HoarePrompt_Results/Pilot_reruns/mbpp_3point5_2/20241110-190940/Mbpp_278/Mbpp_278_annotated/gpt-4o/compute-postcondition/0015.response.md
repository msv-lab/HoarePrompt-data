Output State: **If the tuple `tup` is empty, `count` remains 0. If `tup` is non-empty and does not contain any tuples, `count` is the length of `tup`. If `tup` contains a tuple as an element, the loop breaks at the first occurrence of a tuple and `count` is the index of that tuple in `tup`. The function returns the final value of `count`.**
