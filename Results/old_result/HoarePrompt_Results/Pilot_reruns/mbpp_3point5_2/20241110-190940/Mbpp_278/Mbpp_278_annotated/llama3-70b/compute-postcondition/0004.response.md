Example Answer:
The function returns the index of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. Since `elem` is the second element of the tuple, its index is 1 (assuming indexing starts from 0). Therefore, the output state is `tup` is a tuple containing elements with at least two elements, `elem` is the second element of the tuple, and the function returns 1.
Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing elements with at least two elements, `elem` is the second element of the tuple, and the function returns 1**
