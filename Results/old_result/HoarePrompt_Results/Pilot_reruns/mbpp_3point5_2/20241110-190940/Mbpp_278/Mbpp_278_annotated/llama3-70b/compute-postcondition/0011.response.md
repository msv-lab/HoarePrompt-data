Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing elements, some of which may be tuples. If there is at least one tuple in `tup`, the loop will return the index of the first tuple encountered in `tup`. If there are no tuples in `tup`, the loop will not execute and no changes will be made to the initial state.**
