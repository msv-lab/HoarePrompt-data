Example Answer:
The function returns the index of `elem` in `tup` as 2. Since `elem` is the third element in `tup`, its index would be 2. Therefore, the output state is: `tup` is a tuple containing at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `tup`, and the function returns the index of `elem` in `tup` as 2.
Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least 3 elements, `elem` is the third element in `tup`, and the function returns the index of `elem` in `tup` as 2**
