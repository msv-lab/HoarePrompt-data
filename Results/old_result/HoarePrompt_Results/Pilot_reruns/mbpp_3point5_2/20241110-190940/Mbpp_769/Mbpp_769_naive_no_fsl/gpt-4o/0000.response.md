Correctness: **False**

The program is incorrect because it does not return the correct difference between two lists in all potential cases. For example, if we consider the input [1, 2, 3], [6, 7, 1], the expected output should be [2, 3, 6, 7] according to the problem description. However, the program returns [2, 3, 7, 6]. This shows that the order of elements in the output list is not as expected, making the program incorrect.
