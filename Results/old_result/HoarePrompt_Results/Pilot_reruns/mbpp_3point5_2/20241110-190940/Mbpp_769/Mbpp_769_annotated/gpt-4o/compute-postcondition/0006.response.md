The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists containing elements that support comparison operations. After executing the function body, the function creates `set1` and `set2`, which are sets containing unique elements from `list1` and `list2`, respectively. It then creates `diff_elements`, a set containing elements that are unique to either `list1` or `list2`. Finally, the function creates `result_list`, a list containing elements unique to either `list1` or `list2 sorted based on the index of the combined lists `list1` and `list2`, and returns `result_list`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, create sets of unique elements from each list, find elements unique to either list, sort them based on the index of the combined lists, and return the sorted list of unique elements. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists `list1` and `list2`, creates sets of unique elements from each list, finds elements unique to either list, sorts them based on the index of the combined lists, and returns the sorted list of unique elements.**
