Example Answer:
The set `diff_elements` is assigned the result of the symmetric difference operation between `set1` and `set2`. The symmetric difference operation computes the set of elements that are in either of the sets but not in both. Since `set1` contains unique elements from `list1` and `set2` contains unique elements from `list2`, the `diff_elements` set will contain elements that are unique to either `list1` or `list2`. Therefore, the Output State is: list1 and list2 are lists containing elements that support comparison operations; set1 is a set containing unique elements from list1; set2 is a set containing unique elements from list2; diff_elements is a set containing elements that are unique to either list1 or list2.
Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists containing elements that support comparison operations; set1 is a set containing unique elements from list1; set2 is a set containing unique elements from list2; diff_elements is a set containing elements that are unique to either list1 or list2**
