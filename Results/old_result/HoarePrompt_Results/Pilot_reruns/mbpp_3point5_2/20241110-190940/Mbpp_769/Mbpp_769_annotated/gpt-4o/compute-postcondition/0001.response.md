Example Answer:
set2 is assigned the value of set(list2), where list2 is a list containing elements that support comparison operations. The set function creates a set containing unique elements from list2. Therefore, the Output State is: list1 and list2 are lists containing elements that support comparison operations; set1 is a set containing unique elements from list1; set2 is a set containing unique elements from list2.
Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists containing elements that support comparison operations; set1 is a set containing unique elements from list1; set2 is a set containing unique elements from list2**
