Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the problem description by taking two lists as input, finding the symmetric set difference between them, and returning the sorted result. The annotations also align with the problem description and provide clarity on the purpose of the function. Additionally, the code is concise and efficient in its approach to solving the problem. As there are no examples provided where the code does not work as expected, and the annotations support the problem description, the correctness of the code is confirmed.
