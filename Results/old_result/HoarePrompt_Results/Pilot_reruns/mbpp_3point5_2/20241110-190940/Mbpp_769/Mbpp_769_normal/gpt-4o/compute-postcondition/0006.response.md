The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`, which are lists. `list1` and `set1` are lists, `list2` is a list, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is the result of the symmetric difference operation between `set1` and `set2`, and the function returns `result_list`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, create a set from one of the lists, perform a symmetric difference operation between the two sets, and return the resulting list. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, creates a set from one list, performs a symmetric difference operation between the sets, and returns the resulting list.**
