Example Answer:
A new set `set2` is created by converting `list2` into a set. The values of `list1` and `set1` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `set1` are lists, `set2` is a set created from `list2`.
Output State: **`list1` and `set1` are lists, `set2` is a set created from `list2`**
