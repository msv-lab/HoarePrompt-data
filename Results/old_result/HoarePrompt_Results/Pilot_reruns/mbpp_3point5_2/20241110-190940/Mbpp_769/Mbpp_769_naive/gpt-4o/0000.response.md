Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the difference between two lists as described in the problem statement. The issue lies in the line `result_list.sort(key=lambda x: (list1 + list2).index(x))`. This line tries to sort the `result_list` based on the index of elements in the combined `list1` and `list2`, which does not accurately represent the difference between the two lists.

For example, consider the input `list1 = [1, 2, 3]` and `list2 = [6, 7, 1]`. The expected output should be `[2, 3, 6, 7]`, but the current implementation will return `[6, 7, 2, 3]` which is incorrect.

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases, making the Correctness **False**.
