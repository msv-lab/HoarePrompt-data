Postcondition: ***nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 element, flat_list contains elements returned by func_1 if element is a list, otherwise flat_list contains the appended element. The element is the first element in the nested_list. The program handles both cases of element being a list and not being a list to appropriately populate the flat_list with the elements after the if-else block executes.***
