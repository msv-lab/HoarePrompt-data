According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If there are more items left in the nested_list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list contains at least two items. To execute the loop one more time, the nested_list should have at least three items. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least three items. If item is a list, flat_list is extended with the values returned by func_1(item). If item is not a list, flat_list contains the appended item. The postcondition covers all the possible cases and edge scenarios of the program fragment execution.**
