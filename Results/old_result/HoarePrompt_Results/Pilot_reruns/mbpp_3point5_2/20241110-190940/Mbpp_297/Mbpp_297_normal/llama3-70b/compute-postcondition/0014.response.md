Output State: *nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists, flat_list contains all elements from nested_list flattened out. The loop will iterate through nested_list, checking each element. If the element is a list, it will be processed by func_1 and the resulting elements will be added to flat_list. If the element is not a list, it will be directly appended to flat_list. The loop will handle both cases of elements being lists and not being lists to properly flatten out nested_list and populate flat_list with all elements. If nested_list is empty, the loop will not execute and flat_list will remain empty.*
