Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with any number of items. If nested_list is not empty, flat_list is modified based on the content of nested_list, where each item is checked to determine if it is a list. If the item is a list, flat_list is extended with the results of applying func_1(item). If the item is not a list, flat_list is appended with the item. If nested_list is empty or contains only non-list items, flat_list remains empty.**
