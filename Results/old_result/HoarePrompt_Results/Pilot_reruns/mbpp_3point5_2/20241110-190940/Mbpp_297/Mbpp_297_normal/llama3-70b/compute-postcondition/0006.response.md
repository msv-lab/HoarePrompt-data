Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with the `element` from `nested_list`, and the result is then added to `flat_list` using the `extend` method. The output state will depend on the specific implementation of `func_1` and the current element being processed in `nested_list`.
Output State: **`flat_list` is updated based on the next element in `nested_list`, and appropriate handling of element being a list or not in the loop body**
