Postcondition: ***`nested_list` is the original nested list structure without the first two elements. `flat_list` is the updated list after applying `func_1` to any nested lists encountered and appending the elements that are not lists. The postcondition encompasses both cases where the element is a list and where it is not, ensuring that the final `flat_list` contains all modified elements and newly appended elements, preserving the structure and order of the original nested list.***
