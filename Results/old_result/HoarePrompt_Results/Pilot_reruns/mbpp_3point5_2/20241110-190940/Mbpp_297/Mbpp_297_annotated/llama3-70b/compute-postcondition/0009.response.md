According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the `nested_list`. If there are more elements in the `nested_list`, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the previous iteration, `nested_list` is the original nested list structure without the first element, and `flat_list` is the updated list after applying `func_1` to the remaining nested lists. 

To execute the loop one more time, the `nested_list` needs to have at least one more element to iterate over. Therefore, the `nested_list` should not be empty after removing the first element. The `flat_list` should also be updated accordingly after applying `func_1` to the new element.

State: **nested_list is the original nested list structure without the first two elements, flat_list is the updated list after applying func_1 to the remaining nested lists and the newly appended element**
