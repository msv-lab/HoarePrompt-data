Output State: **nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 1 element, flat_list is a list that contains the result of applying func_1 to all nested lists within the nested_list, and the first element of nested_list if it is not a list. The element variable represents the first element in the nested_list. If nested_list is empty, the loop does not execute, and flat_list remains an empty list.**
