Example Answer:
The item is appended to flat_list. The value of the item is not specified in the initial state, so the output state will depend on the type of the new first element in nested_list. 
Output State: **nested_list is a list with more than 1 element, flat_list is updated based on the type of the new first element in nested_list**
