Example Answer:
`element` is appended to `flat_list`, which represents the updated list after applying `func_1` to the remaining nested lists. The original nested list structure without the first element is stored in `nested_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is the original nested list structure without the first element, flat_list is the updated list after applying func_1 to the remaining nested lists, element is appended to flat_list.
Output State: **nested_list is the original nested list structure without the first element, flat_list is the updated list after applying func_1 to the remaining nested lists, element is appended to flat_list**
