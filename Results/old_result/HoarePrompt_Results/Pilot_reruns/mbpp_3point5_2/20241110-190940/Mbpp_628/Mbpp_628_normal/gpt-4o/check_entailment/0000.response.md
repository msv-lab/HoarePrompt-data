Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes an input string and replaces all spaces in the string with '%20' using the `replace` method in Python. The problem description states that the function should replace all spaces in the input string with '%20', and the code does exactly that for all the given test cases. 
The code also includes assertions to verify the correctness of the output for specific test cases, and the output hints agree with the code, confirming that the code follows the problem description. 
Since the code accurately implements the specified functionality and the output hints support this, we can conclude that the code is correct for all potential cases.
