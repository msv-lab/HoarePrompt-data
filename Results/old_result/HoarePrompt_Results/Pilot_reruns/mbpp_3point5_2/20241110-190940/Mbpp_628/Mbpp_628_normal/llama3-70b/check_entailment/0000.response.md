Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string where all spaces are replaced by '%20'. The code uses the `replace` method of strings in Python, which replaces all occurrences of a specified value with another value in a string. Since the description and the code perfectly align in terms of functionality, and there are no edge cases mentioned that are not handled by the code, we can conclude that the code is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
