Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that accepts a string parameter `s` and returns the uppercase version of that string using the `upper()` method. The code meets the problem description as it correctly converts the given string to uppercase for all potential cases. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the function is working as expected. Therefore, the code is correct.
