Correctness: **True**

The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns the uppercase version of the input string using the `upper()` method in Python. The annotations also confirm that the function `func_1` does exactly what the problem description states, which is to convert a given string to uppercase. Since the code and annotations align with the problem description and there are no edge cases mentioned where the code fails to perform as expected, we can conclude that the code is correct.
