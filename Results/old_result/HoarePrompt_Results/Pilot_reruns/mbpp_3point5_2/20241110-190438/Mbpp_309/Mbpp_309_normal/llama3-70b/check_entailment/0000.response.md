Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided for the function `func_1` simply uses the built-in `max` function in Python to return the maximum value between the two integer parameters `a` and `b`. This directly aligns with the problem description, which states that the function should find the maximum of two numbers. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that the code does not cover. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, the function is correct.
