Correctness: **True**

The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the larger value between them using a ternary operator. The code annotations also confirm that the function returns the larger value between the two input parameters.

Given the problem description and the code annotations, the code follows the problem description for every potential case. The function correctly returns the maximum of two numbers as required. Therefore, the code is correct.
