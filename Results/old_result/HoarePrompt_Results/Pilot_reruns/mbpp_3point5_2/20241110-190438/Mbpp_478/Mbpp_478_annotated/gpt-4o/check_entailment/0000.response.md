Correctness: **True**

The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the input string. The code achieves this by using a list comprehension to iterate through each character in the input string and only keeping the characters that are uppercase.

The problem description asks for a function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string, and the code accurately fulfills this requirement by filtering out lowercase characters and only returning uppercase characters. The code annotations also confirm that the function returns a string containing only uppercase characters from the input string.

Since the code aligns with the problem description and the annotations support the correct behavior of the function, we can conclude that the code is correct for all potential cases.
