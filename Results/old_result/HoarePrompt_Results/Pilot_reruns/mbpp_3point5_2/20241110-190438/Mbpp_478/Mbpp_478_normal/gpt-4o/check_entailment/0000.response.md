Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The description states that the function should remove lowercase substrings from a given string, but the code only filters out lowercase characters and returns the remaining uppercase characters in the same order as they appear. This means that if the input string has lowercase substrings in between uppercase characters, those substrings will not be removed. 

For example:
- Input: 'PYTHon'
- Expected Output: 'PYTH'
- Actual Output: 'PYTH' (Correct)

- Input: 'FInD'
- Expected Output: 'FID'
- Actual Output: 'FID' (Correct)

- Input: 'STRinG'
- Expected Output: 'STRG'
- Actual Output: 'STRG' (Correct)

Since the code does not fully meet the requirements of removing all lowercase substrings from the given string, the correctness is **False**.
