Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided code defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `element`, and then returns the count of occurrences of `element` within the tuple `tup`. The code directly implements the logic described in the problem description. Additionally, the annotations confirm that the function is designed to work with any data type for the element, which aligns with the problem requirements. Since the code follows the problem description and the annotations support the correctness of the function, we can conclude that the code is correct for all potential cases.
