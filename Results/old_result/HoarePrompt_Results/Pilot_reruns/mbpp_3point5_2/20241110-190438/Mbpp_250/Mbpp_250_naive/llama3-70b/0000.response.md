Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly takes in a tuple and an element, then uses the `count` method to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. This implementation directly aligns with the problem description and works as expected for all potential cases. The function is simple and straightforward, making it easy to verify its correctness.
