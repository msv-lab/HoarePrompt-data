Example Answer:
The code extracts the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists` and assigns them to `first_elements`. Since each sublist contains exactly two elements, the first element can be accessed directly. Therefore, `first_elements` will contain the first elements of all sublists in `list_of_lists`.
Output State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements; first_elements contains the first elements of all sublists in list_of_lists**
