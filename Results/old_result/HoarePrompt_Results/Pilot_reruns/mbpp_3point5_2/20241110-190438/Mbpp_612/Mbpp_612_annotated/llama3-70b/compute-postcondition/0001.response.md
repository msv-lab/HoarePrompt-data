The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. After executing the function body, the function returns two lists: one containing all the first elements of the sublists in `list_of_lists`, and another containing all the second elements of the sublists in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists `list_of_lists` and return two separate lists, one with all the first elements and the other with all the second elements of the sublists in `list_of_lists`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, returns a list of all the first elements of the sublists in list_of_lists and a list of all the second elements of the sublists in list_of_lists.**
