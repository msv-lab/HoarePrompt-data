Example Answer:
The list `second_elements` is created by extracting the second element from each sublist in `list_of_lists`. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements; first_elements contains the first elements of all sublists in list_of_lists, second_elements contains the second elements of all sublists in list_of_lists.
Output State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists, where each sublist contains exactly two elements; first_elements contains the first elements of all sublists in list_of_lists, second_elements contains the second elements of all sublists in list_of_lists**
