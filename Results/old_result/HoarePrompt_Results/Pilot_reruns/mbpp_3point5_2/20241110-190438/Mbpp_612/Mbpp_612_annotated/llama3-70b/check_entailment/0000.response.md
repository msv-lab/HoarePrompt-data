Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not follow the problem description. The function is supposed to return a list of two lists, where the first list contains all the first elements of the sublists and the second list contains all the second elements of the sublists. However, the code has syntax errors and it actually returns two separate lists instead of a list of two lists. Additionally, the code is supposed to return a tuple containing two lists, not a list of lists.

Therefore, the code does not work as expected according to the problem description and the annotations provided.
