Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists where each sublist has exactly two elements. It then incorrectly tries to return two lists, one containing all the first elements of the sublists and the other containing all the second elements of the sublists. However, the code has a syntax error as the list comprehension should be enclosed in square brackets []. As a result, the function will raise a SyntaxError when executed.**
