Example Answer:
The function returns a list containing `first_elements` and `second_elements`. The `first_elements` list contains the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the `second_elements` list contains the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list containing the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`; `second_elements` is a list containing the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the function returns a list containing `first_elements` and `second_elements`.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list containing the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`; `second_elements` is a list containing the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the function returns a list containing `first_elements` and `second_elements`**
