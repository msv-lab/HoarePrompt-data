Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to correctly follow the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts a complex number as a parameter and returns a tuple containing the magnitude and phase angle of the complex number. The code uses the `cmath.polar` function to convert the complex number to polar coordinates, which aligns with the problem description. Additionally, the provided test cases also return the expected output, further supporting the correctness of the code. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases.
