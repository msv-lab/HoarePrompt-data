According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a binary string, `n` is a positive integer, `count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is the next integer value after the last iteration, `temp` is a substring of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n + 1`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`s` is a binary string, `n` is a positive integer, `count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is less than `n + 1`, `temp` is a substring of `s`**
