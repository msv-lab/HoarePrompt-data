The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s` which is a binary string and `n` which is a non-negative integer. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and the count remains 0. Otherwise, after the loop executes, the count will be either 0 or 1 depending on the count of '1's in the repeated binary string `s`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and return 0 if `n` is 0. If `n` is not 0, it will count the occurrences of '1's in the repeated binary string `s` and return either 0 or 1 based on the count. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string s and a non-negative integer n. If n is 0, the function returns 0. If n is not 0, it counts the occurrences of '1's in the repeated binary string s and returns either 0 or 1 based on the count.**
