According to the code, the loop will execute `num_rotations` times. At the end of the last iteration, `binary_str` is the rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 0. If the `integer_value` is odd, `count` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `count` remains 0.

To execute the loop one more time, the `num_rotations` needs to be greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`binary_str` is the rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1**
