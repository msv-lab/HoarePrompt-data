Output State: **`s` is a binary string, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than 0, `s` is repeated (n // len(s) + 1) times, `count` is either 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `temp` is a substring of `s` starting from index 2 and ending at index 2 + len(s), `count` is updated by adding the count of '1' in `temp` modulo 2**
