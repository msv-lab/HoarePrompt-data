Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1; `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated binary string, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`binary_str` is the new rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is greater than 1; `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated binary string, `count` is increased by 1**
