The function func_1 accepts a binary string s and a non-negative integer n. If n is 0, the function returns 0. For n greater than 0, it counts the occurrences of '1's in the repeated binary string s and returns either 0 or 1 based on the count. The function calculates the count by iterating over the repeated string and considering the parity of the '1's.
