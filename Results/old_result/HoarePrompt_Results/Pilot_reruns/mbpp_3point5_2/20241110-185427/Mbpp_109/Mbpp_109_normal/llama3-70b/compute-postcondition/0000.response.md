Example Answer: 
The string `s` is repeated `(n // len(s) + 1)` times. Since `s` is a binary string, it consists of 0s and 1s. If `n` is a non-negative integer, the value of `(n // len(s) + 1)` will be the number of times the binary string `s` is repeated. Therefore, the Output State is: **s is a binary string, n is a non-negative integer, s is repeated (n // len(s) + 1) times.**
Output State: **s is a binary string, n is a non-negative integer, s is repeated (n // len(s) + 1) times**
