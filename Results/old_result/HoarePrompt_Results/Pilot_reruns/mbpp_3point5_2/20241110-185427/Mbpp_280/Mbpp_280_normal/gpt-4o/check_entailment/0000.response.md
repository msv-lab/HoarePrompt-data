Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in a list `arr` and an element `element`, then iterates through the list to check if the element is present. If the element is found, the function returns a tuple with True and the index of the element in the list. If the element is not found, the function returns a tuple with False and -1 as the index. The code aligns perfectly with the problem description and the output hints. The function correctly identifies whether the element is present in the list and returns the index accordingly. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
