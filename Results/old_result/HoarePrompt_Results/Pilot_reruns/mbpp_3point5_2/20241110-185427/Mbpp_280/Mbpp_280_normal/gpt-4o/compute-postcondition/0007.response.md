Example Answer:
The function returns `True` and the value of `index`, which is currently set to 2. The return statement does not change the state of other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of elements with at least 3 elements, `index` is 2, and the function returns True along with the value of index.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 3 elements, `index` is 2, and the function returns True along with the value of index**
