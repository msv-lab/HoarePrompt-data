Example Answer: 
The function returns True and the value of `i`, which is 1. The state of the other variables does not change. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `arr, the function returns True, and `i`.
Output State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, `x` is the second element in `arr, the function returns True, 1**
