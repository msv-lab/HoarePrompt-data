Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the list `arr` and if `elem` is found, it returns True along with the index `i` of the first occurrence of `elem`. If `elem` is not found, it returns False and -1. The code covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that it behaves as expected.
