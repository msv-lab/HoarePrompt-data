Example Answer:
The function returns False and -1. This means that the element `elem` was not found in the array `arr`. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is the same as the initial state.
Output State: **If `elem` is found in `arr`, the function returns True and the index `i` of the first occurrence of `elem`. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function returns False and -1.**
