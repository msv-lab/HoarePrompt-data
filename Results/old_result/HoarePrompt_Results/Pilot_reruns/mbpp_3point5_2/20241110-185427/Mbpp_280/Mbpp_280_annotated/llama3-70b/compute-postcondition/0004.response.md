Example Answer:
The function returns True and the value of i, which is 1. The state of arr, elem, and x remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: arr is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, elem is a single element, i is 1, x is the second element in arr and the function returns True, 1.
Output State: **arr is a list of elements with at least 2 elements, elem is a single element, i is 1, x is the second element in arr, and the function returns True, 1**
