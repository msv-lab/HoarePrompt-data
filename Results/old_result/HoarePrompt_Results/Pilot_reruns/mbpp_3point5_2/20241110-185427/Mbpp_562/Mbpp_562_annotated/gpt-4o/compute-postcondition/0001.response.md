According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is at least one sublist in `list_of_lists`. The variable `max_length` being 0 does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist, and `sublist` is the first sublist in the `list_of_lists`.
State: **`list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_length` is 0**
