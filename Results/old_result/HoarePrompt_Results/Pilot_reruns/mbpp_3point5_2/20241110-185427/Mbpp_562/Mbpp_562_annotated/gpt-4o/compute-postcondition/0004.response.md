According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more sublists in `list_of_lists`. At the end of the last iteration, `list_of_lists` contains at least one sublist, `sublist` is the first sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_length` is the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`. If the length of `sublist` is greater than `max_length`, `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`. Otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged. So for the loop to be executed one more time, there must be at least one more sublist in `list_of_lists`.
State: **`list_of_lists` contains at least two sublists, `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`, `max_length` is the maximum length of any sublist in `list_of_lists`**
