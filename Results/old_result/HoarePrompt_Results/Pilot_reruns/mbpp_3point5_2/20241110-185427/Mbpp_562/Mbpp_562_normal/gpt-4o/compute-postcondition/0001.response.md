According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list_of_lists. If the list_of_lists has at least 1 sublist, the loop can execute. As the max_length is 0, it does not affect the execution of the loop. So for the loop to be executed, the list_of_lists must have at least 1 sublist.
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `max_length` is 0**
