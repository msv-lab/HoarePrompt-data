Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a list of lists as input and returns the length of the longest sublist in the input `lists`. The code achieves this by using a generator expression within the `max()` function to iterate over each sublist in the input `lists` and calculate the length of each sublist. Finally, it returns the maximum length found.

The output hints also confirm that the function returns the length of the longest sublist in the input `lists`, which aligns with the problem description. Additionally, there are no edge cases or scenarios provided where the code may fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, based on both the code logic and the output hints, the code appears to be correct for all potential cases.
