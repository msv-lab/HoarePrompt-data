Example Answer:
The length of the first sublist in `list_of_lists` is assigned to `max_length`. Since `list_of_lists` has at least 1 sublist, `max_length` will be the length of the first sublist. 
Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 1 sublist, `max_length` is the length of the first sublist**
