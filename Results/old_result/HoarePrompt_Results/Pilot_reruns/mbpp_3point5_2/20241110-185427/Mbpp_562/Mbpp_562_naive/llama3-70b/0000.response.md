Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly returns the length of the longest sublist in the given list of sublists. It uses a generator expression to iterate through each sublist and calculate its length, then takes the maximum value of all the lengths. This approach ensures that the function accurately identifies and returns the length of the longest sublist in the input list. Since there are no cases mentioned where the program might fail to provide the correct output, we can conclude that the program is correct.
