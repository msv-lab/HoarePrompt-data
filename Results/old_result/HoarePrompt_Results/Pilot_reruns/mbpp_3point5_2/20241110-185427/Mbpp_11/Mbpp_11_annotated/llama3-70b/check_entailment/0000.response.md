Correctness: **False**

The code does not always follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the function should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. However, the code provided only removes the characters at the first and last occurrence indices, without considering the characters themselves. This means that if the character at the first and last occurrence indices are not the same, the code will not produce the correct output.

For example, if we have a string "hello", and we want to remove the first and last occurrence of the character 'l', the correct output should be "heo". But with the current implementation of the code, the output will be "heo". This is because the code only removes the characters at the indices of the first and last occurrences of 'l', without considering the actual characters themselves.

Therefore, the code does not fully adhere to the problem description for every potential case.
