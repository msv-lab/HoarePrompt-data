Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` simply checks if the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price` and returns True if they are equal, indicating no profit or loss. This logic covers all potential cases as per the problem description. There are no edge cases or scenarios where this logic would fail. Hence, the program is correct.
