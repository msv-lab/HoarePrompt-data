The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `cost_price` and `selling_price`, both of which are integers. The function does not have a specific output state, as it depends on the values of `cost_price` and `selling_price`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `cost_price` and `selling_price`, without specifying a specific return value.
