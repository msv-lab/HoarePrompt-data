Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in two integer parameters `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns True if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`, otherwise it returns False. The function is simple and straightforward, accurately following the problem description. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description that the code does not cover. The output hints also align with the code, confirming that the function behaves as expected.
