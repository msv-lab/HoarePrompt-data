Example Answer: 
The function calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula math.pi * radius ** 2 * height. The values of radius and height are non-negative numbers, so the calculation will be based on those values. The function returns the calculated volume. Therefore, the Output State is: radius and height are non-negative numbers, and the function returns the volume of the cylinder.
Output State: **radius and height are non-negative numbers, and the function returns the volume of the cylinder**
