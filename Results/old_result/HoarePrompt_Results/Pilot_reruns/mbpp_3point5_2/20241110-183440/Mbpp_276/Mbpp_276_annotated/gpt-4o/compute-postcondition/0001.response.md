Example Answer: 
The function returns the value of `volume`, which is calculated based on the provided formula using the values of `radius` and `height`. The values of `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers, so the volume will be a non-negative number as well. The return statement does not change the state, so the output state is: radius and height are non-negative numbers, and the function returns the calculated volume.
Output State: **radius and height are non-negative numbers, volume is the calculated volume based on the given formula**
