Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The function `func_1` correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder based on the provided formula `volume = math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. The assertions provided test the function with different radius and height values and use `math.isclose` to account for floating-point precision errors. The results of the assertions match the expected volume values, indicating that the program is correct for all tested cases.
