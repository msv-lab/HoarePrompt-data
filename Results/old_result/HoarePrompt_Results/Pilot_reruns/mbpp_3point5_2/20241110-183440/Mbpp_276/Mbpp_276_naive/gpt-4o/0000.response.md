Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder using the provided formula. The formula for the volume of a cylinder is `Ï€ * radius^2 * height`, which is implemented correctly in the function `func_1`. The program also includes assertions with a relative tolerance of 0.001 to check the calculated volumes against expected values for different inputs, which ensures the correctness of the function. Since the program meets the requirements of the problem description and all the provided test cases pass, the correctness of the program is true.
