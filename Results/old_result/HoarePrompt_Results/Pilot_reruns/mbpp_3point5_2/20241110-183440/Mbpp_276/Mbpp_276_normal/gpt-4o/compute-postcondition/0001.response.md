Example Answer:
The function returns the value of `volume`, which is calculated based on the values of `radius` and `height`. The variables `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers, and the volume is calculated using the formula for the volume of a cylinder. Therefore, the output state is `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers, and the function returns the calculated volume based on these values.
Output State: **`radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers, and the function returns the calculated volume based on these values**
