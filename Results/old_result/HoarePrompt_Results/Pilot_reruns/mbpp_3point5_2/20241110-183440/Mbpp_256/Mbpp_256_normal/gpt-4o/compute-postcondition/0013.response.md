Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to `True`, `i` is 2. If `is_prime[i]` is true, the loop will execute and set `is_prime[j]` to `False` for all `j` such that `j` is a multiple of `i` and `j` is less than `n`. If `n` is less than 4 or `i` is not valid, the loop will not execute.***
