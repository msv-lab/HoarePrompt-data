According to the code, the loop can execute if `i * i` is less than `n`, and if `i` is at least 2. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted so that `j` is at least `i * i`. So, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be modified to `n` is at least 4, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to `True`, `i` is 2, and `j` is equal to `i * i`.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `i * i`**
