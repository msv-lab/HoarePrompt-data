The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. This covers the cases where `n` is equal to 0, 1, or 2. If `n` is greater than 2, the function calculates the sum of all prime numbers up to the square root of `n` using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm and returns that sum. The function correctly implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to identify prime numbers and calculate their sum.
