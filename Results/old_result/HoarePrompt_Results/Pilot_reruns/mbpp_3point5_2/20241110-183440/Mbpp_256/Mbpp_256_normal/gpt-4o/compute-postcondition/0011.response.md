According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 4, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n`, `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`. In order for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted such that it is less than `n`. Since `j` is currently set to `n`, it needs to be updated to be less than `n`.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n`, `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`, `j` is less than `n`**
