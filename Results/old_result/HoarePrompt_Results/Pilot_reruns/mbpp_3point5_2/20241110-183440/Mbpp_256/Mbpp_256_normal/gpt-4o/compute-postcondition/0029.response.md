According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `j < n` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 4, `j` is 20, and `is_prime[j]` is False. Therefore, the next iteration should have `j` less than `n`, which means the next `j` should be less than `n`. Also, since `i` is 4, the next value of `j` should be in the range from `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. Therefore, the next value of `j` should be `j + i`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 4, `j` is 24, `is_prime[j]` is False**
