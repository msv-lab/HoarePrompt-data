The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. This covers the cases where `n` is equal to 0, 1, or 2. 

If `n` is greater than 2, the function returns the sum of all prime numbers up to the square root of `n` after eliminating non-prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return either 0 (if `n` is less than or equal to 2) or the sum of all prime numbers up to the square root of `n` (if `n` is greater than 2).
