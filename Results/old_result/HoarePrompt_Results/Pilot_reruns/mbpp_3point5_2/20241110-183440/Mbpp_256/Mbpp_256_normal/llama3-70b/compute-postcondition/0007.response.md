Postcondition: ***`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is incremented by 1. If `num` is divisible by `i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of `num` and `i`. This postcondition covers all possible cases including the edge cases where `num` is not divisible by `i`.***
