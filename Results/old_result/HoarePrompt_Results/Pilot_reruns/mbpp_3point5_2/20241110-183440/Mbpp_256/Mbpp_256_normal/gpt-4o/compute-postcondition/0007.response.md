According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 4, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` should be less than `n`. Therefore, `j` needs to be adjusted to 6. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 6, `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`**
