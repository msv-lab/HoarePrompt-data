According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, `j` is equal to `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is now False. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently equal to `n`, it needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. 
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime[0]` is True, `is_prime[1]` is True, `i` is 3, `j` is less than `n`**
