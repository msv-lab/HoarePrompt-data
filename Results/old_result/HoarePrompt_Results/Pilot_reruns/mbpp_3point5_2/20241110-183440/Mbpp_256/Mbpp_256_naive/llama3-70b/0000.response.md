Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program defines a function that takes in a non-negative number `n` and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given number. The inner function `is_prime()` correctly checks if a number is prime, and the main function `func_1()` correctly counts the prime numbers less than `n`. 

The program iterates through all numbers from 2 to `n-1` (exclusive) and checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime()` function. It then increments a counter if the number is prime. This logic is correctly implemented according to the problem description, making the program output the correct count of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number for all potential cases. 

Hence, the program is correct.
