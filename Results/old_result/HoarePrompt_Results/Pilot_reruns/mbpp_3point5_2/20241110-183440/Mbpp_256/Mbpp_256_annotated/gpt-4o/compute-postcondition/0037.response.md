The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is a non-negative integer. 

Case_1: If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. 

Case_2: If `n` is at least 4, the function calculates some values and returns the sum of `is_prime`. In this case, `i` is the last value before the loop ends, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are False, and `is_prime[j]` is False for all `j` in the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is at least 4, the function performs some calculations relating to prime numbers and returns the sum of the resulting values.
