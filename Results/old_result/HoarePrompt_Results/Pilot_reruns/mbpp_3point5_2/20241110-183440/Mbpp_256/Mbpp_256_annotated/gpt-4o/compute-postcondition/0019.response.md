According to the code, the loop can execute again if the range specified by `range(i * i, n, i)` is not empty. This range starts from `i * i` and increments by `i` until reaching `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False where j is less than n. To execute the loop one more time, the range specified should not be empty, so `i * i` should be less than `n`. Therefore, the `i` needs to be adjusted to 3 in order for the range to be non-empty.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False, where j is less than n**
