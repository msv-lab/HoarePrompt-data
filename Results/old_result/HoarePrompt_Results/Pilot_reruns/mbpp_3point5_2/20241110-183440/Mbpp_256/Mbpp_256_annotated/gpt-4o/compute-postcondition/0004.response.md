According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 4 (since int(n ** 0.5) + 1 will be at least 2 for n >= 4). Before the loop starts, `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` being False do not ensure that the loop will execute, so they need to be adjusted to `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, and `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are still False.
State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False**
