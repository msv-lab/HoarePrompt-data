Functionality: The function `is_prime` accepts a non-negative integer `num` as a parameter. It checks if `num` is a prime number by iterating from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. If `num` is divisible by any number in the specified range, the function returns False. If `num` is not divisible by any number in the specified range, the function returns True. The function accurately determines whether the input `num` is a prime number based on the code logic.
