Example Answer: 
The value of `is_prime[j]` is assigned `False`. The value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, so the specific value of `is_prime[j]` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False.
Output State: **`n` is at least 4, `i` is 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False**
