Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is the last value before the loop ended, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False for all `j` in the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. If `i` reaches a value where `i * i >= n`, the loop does not execute and no changes are made to the state of the program variables.***
