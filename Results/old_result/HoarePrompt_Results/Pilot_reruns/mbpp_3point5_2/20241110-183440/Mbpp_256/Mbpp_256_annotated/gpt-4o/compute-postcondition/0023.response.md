Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 4, `i` is 3, `is_prime[0]` is False, and `is_prime[1]` is False. If `i` is at least 2, the loop will execute and set `is_prime[j]` to False for each `j` in the range of `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. The values of `n`, `i`, `is_prime[0]`, `is_prime[1]`, and `is_prime[j]` will remain the same as in the initial state. If `i` is less than 2, the loop will not execute.***
