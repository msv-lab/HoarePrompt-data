According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `num` and `num` is not divisible by `i`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is greater than 3 and `i` is 3. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`num` is greater than 3 and `i` is 4**
