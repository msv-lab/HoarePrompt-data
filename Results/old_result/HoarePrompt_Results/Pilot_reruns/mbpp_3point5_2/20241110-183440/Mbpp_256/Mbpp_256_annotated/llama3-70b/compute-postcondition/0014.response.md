The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`, which is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the function follows three cases:

Case_1: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False.

Case_2: If `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the function checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any `i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the loop completes without any changes to the variables.

Case_3: If `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the function checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is not divisible by any `i`, the function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to determine if the input `num` is a prime number by checking its divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. If `num` is not divisible by any number in the specified range, the function returns True.
