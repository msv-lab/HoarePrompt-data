Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` is supposed to find the last digit in the factorial of a given number. However, the code only considers the last digit of the factorial calculation, leading to incorrect results. For example, when `n = 21`, the factorial of 21 is `51090942171709440000`, but the code returns `0` as the last digit, which is incorrect. The factorial calculation should include all digits of the factorial number, not just the last one. This discrepancy between the code behavior and the problem description makes the code incorrect.
