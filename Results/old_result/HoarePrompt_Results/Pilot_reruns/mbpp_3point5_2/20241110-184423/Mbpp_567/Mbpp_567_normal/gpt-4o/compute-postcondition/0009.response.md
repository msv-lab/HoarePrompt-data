According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of the list `lst`. If `i` is less than the length of the list minus 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` has at least 2 elements, and `i` is 2. To execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be such that it is less than the length of the list minus 1. So `i` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **`lst` has at least 2 elements, `i` is 1**
