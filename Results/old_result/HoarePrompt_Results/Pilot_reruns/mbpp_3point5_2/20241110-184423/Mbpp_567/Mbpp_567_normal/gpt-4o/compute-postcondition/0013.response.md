Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts a list `lst` of elements that can be compared using the ">" operator. It iterates through the list and checks if each element at index i is greater than the element at index i + 1. If any comparison is true, the function returns False. If all comparisons are false and the list has at least 2 elements, the function returns True. If the list has less than 2 elements, the function also returns True. However, the function does not handle the case where the list is empty, and it should explicitly return False in that case to cover this missing functionality.**
