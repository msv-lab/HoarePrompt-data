Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function checks whether a specified list is sorted or not by iterating through the list and checking if each element is less than or equal to the next element. This logic is correctly implemented as it covers all potential cases where the list may or may not be sorted. The function uses the `all()` function along with a generator expression to efficiently check all elements in the list. Since the logic is sound and covers all possible scenarios, the program is correct.
