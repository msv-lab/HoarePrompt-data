The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. **Precondition**: `student_data` is a dictionary where each key is a student name and the corresponding value is a tuple of two floats representing the student's height and weight. `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively. After executing the function body, the function returns a filtered dictionary containing only students who meet the minimum height and weight requirements specified by `min_height` and `min_weight`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to filter out students from the input dictionary `student_data` based on the minimum height and weight requirements provided.
