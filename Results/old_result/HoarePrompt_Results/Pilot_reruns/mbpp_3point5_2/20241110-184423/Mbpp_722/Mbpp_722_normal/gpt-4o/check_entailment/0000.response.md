Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary `student_dict`, and two floats `min_height` and `min_weight`. It then filters the dictionary based on the condition that the height of each student is greater than or equal to `min_height` and the weight of each student is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. The filtered dictionary is returned as the output. The code correctly implements this logic for all test cases provided. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code and further confirm that the function is correctly filtering the students based on height and weight requirements. Hence, the code is correct.
