Correctness: **True**

The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary of student names and their corresponding height and weight, as well as minimum height and weight values. It filters out students whose height and weight are both above the minimum values and returns a new dictionary with only the filtered students.

The program is correct as it filters out the students correctly based on the minimum height and weight values provided in each test case. Each test case covers different scenarios such as filtering out only one student, filtering out multiple students, and not filtering out any students. In each case, the program produces the expected output, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
