Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function takes a tuple as input and checks if any of the elements in the tuple are `None`. The `any()` function is correctly used with a generator expression to check for `None` values in the tuple. This logic covers all potential cases where the tuple may contain `None` values. Therefore, the program is correct.
