Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes a tuple as input and returns True if any element in the tuple is None. The code uses the `any` function along with a generator expression to check if any element in the tuple is None. This implementation directly aligns with the problem description, as it accurately checks for the presence of None values in the tuple. Additionally, the code annotations also confirm that the function returns True when any element in the tuple is None. Since there are no cases provided where the code does not work as expected in the problem description and all examples seem to work correctly, the code is considered correct.
