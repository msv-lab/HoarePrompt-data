Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `count` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums`, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums`, `count` is incremented by 1**
