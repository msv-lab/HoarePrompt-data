According to the code, the loop can execute if `nums` has at least 2 elements. Since the loop iterates from `i + 1` to the length of `nums`, `i` should be such that `i + 1` is less than the length of `nums`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of `nums` minus 1. Additionally, at the start of the loop, `j` will be equal to `i + 1`, so `j` should be updated accordingly. The count variable is not crucial for the loop execution.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `count` is 0**
