According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, and `count` is 0. To execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than the length of `nums`. So, `j` should be adjusted to `i + 2`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. `j` is equal to `i + 2`. `count` is 0**
