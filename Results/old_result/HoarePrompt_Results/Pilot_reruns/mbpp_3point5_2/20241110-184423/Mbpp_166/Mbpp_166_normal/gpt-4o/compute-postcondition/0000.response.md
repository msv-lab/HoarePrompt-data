Example Answer: 
`even_count` is assigned the sum of 1 for each element in `lst` that is even (divisible by 2). The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: lst is a list of integers, even_count is the count of even numbers in lst.
Output State: **lst is a list of integers, even_count is the count of even numbers in lst**
