The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`, which is a list of integers. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, the function iterates through all pairs of elements (i, j) in `nums` such that i is less than the length of `nums` minus 1. If the bitwise XOR of nums[i] and nums[j] results in an even number, the count is incremented. If `nums` has less than 2 elements or the XOR condition is never met, the count remains unchanged. If `nums` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the count remains 0. The function returns the final value of count after the loop iterations.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list of integers nums. If nums has at least 2 elements, it iterates through all pairs of elements to check if their XOR results in an even number. The function returns the count of such pairs. If nums has less than 2 elements or the XOR condition is never met, the count remains unchanged. If nums is empty, the count is 0.**
