Example Answer: 
The variable `even_pairs` is calculated by multiplying `even_count` by `even_count - 1` and then dividing by 2. The previous values of `even_count` and `odd_count` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: lst is a list of integers, even_count is the count of even numbers in lst, odd_count is the count of odd numbers in lst, even_pairs is calculated as described.
Output State: **lst is a list of integers, even_count is the count of even numbers in lst, odd_count is the count of odd numbers in lst, even_pairs is calculated as described**
