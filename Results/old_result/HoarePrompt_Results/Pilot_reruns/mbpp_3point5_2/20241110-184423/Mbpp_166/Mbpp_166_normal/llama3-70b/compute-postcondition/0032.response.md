According to the code, the loop can execute if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to the length of `nums`, and XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than the length of `nums`, so `j` should be reduced by 1. 
State: **`nums` has at least 2 elements, `i` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to the length of `nums` minus 1, XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number. If the XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` results in an even number, `count` is incremented by 1.**
