Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number. It first calculates the count of even and odd numbers in the list, then calculates the number of pairs for both even and odd numbers separately, and finally returns the total count of pairs that xor to an even number. The assertions provided in the program also pass for the given test cases, indicating that the program is working as expected for those cases.
