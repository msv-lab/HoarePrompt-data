Example Answer:
The function returns `False`. The variables `s` and `first_char` are not changed by this operation. Therefore, the output state is `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and the function returns `False`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and the function returns `False`**
