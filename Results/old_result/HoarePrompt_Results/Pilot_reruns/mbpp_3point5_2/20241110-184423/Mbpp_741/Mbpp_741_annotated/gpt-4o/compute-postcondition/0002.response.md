Example Answer:
The variable `first_char` is assigned the value of the first character of string `s`. If `s` is empty, an IndexError will occur. Otherwise, the value of `first_char` will be the first character of `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: *s is a string, first_char is the first character of s*.
Output State: **s is a string, first_char is the first character of s**
