Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code appears to be correct as it uses the set data structure to remove duplicates from the input string `s`, and then checks if the length of the set is equal to 1. This condition will only be true if all characters in the input string are the same, which aligns with the problem description. The function returns True if all characters in the string are the same, and False otherwise. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description.
