Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The function `func_1` correctly checks whether all characters in the input string are the same or not. It iterates through each character and compares it with the first character, if any character is found to be different, it returns False. Otherwise, it returns True. The provided test cases cover the scenarios where the input string has all characters the same or different, and the function returns the expected results for those cases. Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases.
