To determine the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet and initial state.

The initial state is:
- `nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element.
- `flat_list` is an empty list.
- `element` is the first element in `nested_list`.

Given the code snippet:
```python
flat_list.append(element)
```

Here's the step-by-step analysis:

1. The `append` method is called on `flat_list`.
2. The argument passed to `append` is `element`, which is the first element of `nested_list`.
3. Since `flat_list` is initially empty, appending `element` to it will add this element as the first (and currently only) element of `flat_list`.
4. The state of `nested_list` and `element` remains unchanged because the operation does not modify them directly.

Therefore, after executing the code snippet, the state of the variables is as follows:

- `nested_list` remains a list with at least 1 element.
- `flat_list` is now a list containing the first element of `nested_list`.
- `element` is still the first element in `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list with at least 1 element, `flat_list` contains the first element of `nested_list`, `element` is the first element in `nested_list`.**
