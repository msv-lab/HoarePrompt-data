Based on the loop code and the output states after each iteration, I can determine the loop's output state.

The loop appears to be flattening a nested list into a single list. It iterates over each element in the `nested_list`. If the element is a list, it calls the `func_1` function on that element and extends the `flat_list` with the returned elements. If the element is not a list, it simply appends the element to the `flat_list`.

Here's the output state:

Output State: **`flat_list` contains all non-list elements from `nested_list` and all elements returned by `func_1` for each list element in `nested_list`. If `nested_list` is empty, `flat_list` remains empty.**

In more detail:

* If `nested_list` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `flat_list` remains empty.
* If `nested_list` contains only non-list elements, `flat_list` will contain all those elements.
* If `nested_list` contains lists, `flat_list` will contain all elements returned by `func_1` for each of those lists, as well as any non-list elements.
* If `nested_list` contains a mix of lists and non-list elements, `flat_list` will contain all elements returned by `func_1` for each list, as well as all non-list elements.

Note that the output state assumes that `func_1` is a function that takes a list as input and returns a list of elements. The exact behavior of `func_1` is not specified, but it is assumed to be a function that can handle lists as input.
