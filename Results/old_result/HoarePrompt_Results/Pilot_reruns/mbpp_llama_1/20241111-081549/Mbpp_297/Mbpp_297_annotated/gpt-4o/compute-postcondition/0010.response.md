The code `flat_list.extend(func_1(item))` affects the `flat_list` variable by extending it with the result of `func_1(item)`. The function `func_1(item)` is not defined in the given code, so we assume it takes an item from the `nested_list` and returns a list.

Since `nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain nested lists with at least two elements, we can assume that `item` is an element from this list. The function `func_1(item)` is applied to each `item` in the `nested_list`, and its result is extended to the `flat_list`.

The output state is: `nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain nested lists with at least two elements, `flat_list` is extended with the results of `func_1(item)` for each `item` in `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a non-empty list that may contain nested lists with at least two elements, `flat_list` is extended with the results of `func_1(item)` for each `item` in `nested_list`**
