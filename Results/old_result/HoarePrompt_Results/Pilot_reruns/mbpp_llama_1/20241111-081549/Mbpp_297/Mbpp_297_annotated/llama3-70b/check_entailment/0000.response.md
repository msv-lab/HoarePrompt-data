Correctness: **True**

The code correctly implements a function to flatten a given nested list structure. The function `func_1` recursively traverses the nested list, appending elements that are not lists and extending the `flat_list` with the result of recursive calls on elements that are lists.

The annotations provided accurately describe the state of the program at different points, which helped me understand the logic of the code. The annotations mention that the function assumes `func_1` is defined and correctly flattens the sublists, which is a valid assumption since the function is recursive and calls itself to flatten sublists.

The problem description requires the function to flatten a nested list structure, and the code does exactly that. It handles the case where the input list is empty, returning an empty list, and it correctly flattens lists with multiple levels of nesting.

I couldn't find any potential case where the code does not work as expected according to the problem description. The annotations did not mention any specific edge cases that the code does not handle, and I couldn't think of any examples where the code would not produce the correct output.

Overall, the code correctly implements the required functionality, and I couldn't find any cases where it does not work as expected.
