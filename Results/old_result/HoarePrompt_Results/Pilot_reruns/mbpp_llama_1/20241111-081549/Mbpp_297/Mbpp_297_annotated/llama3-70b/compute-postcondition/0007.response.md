The value of `element` is the second element in the `nested_list`. Since `nested_list` can contain integers and/or lists with at least two elements, the second element can be either an integer or a list.

The code appends `element` to `flat_list`, so the state of `flat_list` changes. The state of `nested_list` remains the same.

Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least two elements, `flat_list` is a list with an additional element which is the second element of `nested_list`, and `element` is the second element in the `nested_list`.

Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that can contain integers and/or lists with at least two elements, `flat_list` is a list with an additional element which is the second element of `nested_list`, and `element` is the second element in the `nested_list`.**
