Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I have analyzed the function `func_1` as follows:

The function `func_1` accepts a string parameter `input_string`. According to the annotations, the function returns the input string with all spaces replaced with '%20'. However, upon reviewing the code, I notice that it uses the `replace()` method, which replaces all occurrences of the specified value (in this case, a space) with the specified replacement value (in this case, '%20').

The code does not have any conditional statements or error handling, so it will replace all spaces with '%20' regardless of the input string's content. This means that the function will also replace multiple consecutive spaces with '%20%20...'.

Considering all potential cases, I conclude that the functionality of the function is to replace all spaces in the input string with '%20', including multiple consecutive spaces.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input, replaces all spaces (including multiple consecutive spaces) with '%20', and returns the resulting string. **
