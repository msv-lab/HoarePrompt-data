The function returns the result of `s.replace(' ', '%20')`. This replaces all spaces in the string `s` with '%20'. The state of `s` itself does not change, but the function returns the modified string. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, and the function returns the string with all spaces replaced with '%20'.

Output State: **`s` is a string, and the function returns the string with all spaces replaced with '%20'**
