The function accepts two lists `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of elements that are in exactly one of the lists. If both lists are empty, it returns an empty list. If one list is empty, it returns a sorted list of elements from the non-empty list. It treats duplicate elements as distinct and raises a `TypeError` if the lists contain non-hashable elements.
