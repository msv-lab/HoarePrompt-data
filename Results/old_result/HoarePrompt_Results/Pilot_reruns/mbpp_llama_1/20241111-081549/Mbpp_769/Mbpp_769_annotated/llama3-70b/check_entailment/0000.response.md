Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` appears to correctly implement the problem description. The function takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input and returns a sorted list of elements that are in exactly one of the lists.

The code uses the symmetric difference operator (`^`) to find the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. The `set` data structure is used to remove duplicates and the `sorted` function is used to sort the resulting list.

The annotations provided with the code accurately describe the behavior of the function, including the treatment of duplicate elements and the handling of non-hashable elements. The annotations also mention that the function raises a `TypeError` if the lists contain non-hashable elements, which is consistent with the behavior of the `set` data structure in Python.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description. The function correctly handles the cases where both lists are empty, one list is empty, and where the lists contain duplicate elements.

The annotations influenced my reasoning by providing additional context and examples of the function's behavior. However, I double-checked the annotations against the code and the problem description to ensure that they accurately reflected the function's behavior.

Overall, the code appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
