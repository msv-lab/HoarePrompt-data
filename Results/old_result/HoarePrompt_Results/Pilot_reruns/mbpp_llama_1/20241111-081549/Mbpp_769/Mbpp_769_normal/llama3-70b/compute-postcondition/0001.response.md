Let's break it down step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists.

The function returns a sorted list of unique elements that meet certain conditions:

* The elements are in either `list1` or `list2` (but not necessarily in both).
* The elements are not present in both `list1` and `list2`.

In other words, the function returns a sorted list of elements that are exclusive to either `list1` or `list2`, but not common to both.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a sorted list of unique elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both.

Functionality: **The function accepts two lists, list1 and list2, and returns a sorted list of unique elements that are in either list1 or list2 but not in both.**
