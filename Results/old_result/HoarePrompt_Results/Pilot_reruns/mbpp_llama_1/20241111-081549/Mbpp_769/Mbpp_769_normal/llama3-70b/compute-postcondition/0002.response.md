Let's break down the code and annotations step by step:

1. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`.
2. The function returns a sorted list of unique elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both. This is achieved by using the symmetric difference operator (`^`) on the sets created from `list1` and `list2`, and then sorting the resulting list.
3. The annotations suggest that the function returns a sorted list of unique elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. This matches the actual code.

However, let's consider some potential edge cases:

* If `list1` and `list2` are identical, the function will return an empty list, since there are no elements that are in one list but not the other.
* If `list1` or `list2` is an empty list, the function will return a sorted list of unique elements from the non-empty list.
* If `list1` and `list2` contain duplicate elements, the function will still return a sorted list of unique elements, since the `set` data structure removes duplicates.

Considering these edge cases, the functionality of the function can be summarized as:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a sorted list of unique elements that are in either `list1` or `list2` but not in both. If the lists are identical, the function returns an empty list. If one list is empty, the function returns a sorted list of unique elements from the non-empty list. The function also removes duplicates from the resulting list. **
