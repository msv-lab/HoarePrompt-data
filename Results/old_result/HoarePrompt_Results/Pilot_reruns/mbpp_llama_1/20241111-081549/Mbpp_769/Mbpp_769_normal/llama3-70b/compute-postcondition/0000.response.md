To determine the output state, let's break down the given code:

1. `set(list1)` and `set(list2)` convert the lists `list1` and `list2` into sets, which are unordered collections of unique elements. This removes any duplicate elements within each list.

2. `set(list1) ^ set(list2)` performs a symmetric difference operation on the two sets. This operation returns a new set containing elements that are in exactly one of the sets, i.e., elements that are in `list1` or `list2` but not in both.

3. `list(...)` converts the resulting set back into a list.

4. `sorted(...)` sorts the list in ascending order.

Since the initial state only mentions that `list1` and `list2` are lists without specifying their contents, the output state will describe the nature of the returned value without specifying exact elements.

Output State: **The function returns a sorted list of unique elements that are in list1 or list2 but not in both.**
