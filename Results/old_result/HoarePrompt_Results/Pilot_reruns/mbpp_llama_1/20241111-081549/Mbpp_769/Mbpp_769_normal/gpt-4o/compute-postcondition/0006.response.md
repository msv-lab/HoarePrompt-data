The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, both of which are lists. After executing the function body, the function returns a sorted list containing the elements that are in either `list1` or `list2`, but not in both. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and return a sorted list of elements that are unique to either `list1` or `list2`.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, list1 and list2, both of which are lists, and returns a sorted list of elements that are unique to either list1 or list2.**
