Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly converts a given string to uppercase. The function uses the built-in `upper()` method of Python strings, which converts all lowercase characters in a string into uppercase characters and leaves all other characters unchanged.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function handles strings with lowercase letters, uppercase letters, numbers, special characters, and even empty strings correctly. It also handles non-English characters correctly, as the `upper()` method is Unicode-aware and can handle characters from any language.

For example, if you call `func_1("Hello, World!")`, it will return `"HELLO, WORLD!"`, which is the expected result. Similarly, if you call `func_1("hello")`, it will return `"HELLO"`, and if you call `func_1("")`, it will return `""`.

Overall, the function is simple, yet correct and effective in achieving its intended purpose.
