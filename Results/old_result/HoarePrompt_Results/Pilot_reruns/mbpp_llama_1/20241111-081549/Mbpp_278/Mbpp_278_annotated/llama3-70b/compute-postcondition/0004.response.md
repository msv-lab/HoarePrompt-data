The function returns `tup.index(elem)`, which is the index of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. Since `elem` is the second element in the tuple, its index is 1. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is `tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the tuple, and the function returns 1.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element in the tuple, and the function returns 1**
