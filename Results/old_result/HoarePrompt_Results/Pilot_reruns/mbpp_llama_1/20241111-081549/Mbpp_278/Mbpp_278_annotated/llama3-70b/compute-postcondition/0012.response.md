The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`. `tup` is a tuple that may contain a tuple as one of its elements. After executing the function body, there are two possible return cases:

Case 1: If `tup` is not empty, the function returns the index of the first tuple element found in `tup`. If no tuple elements are found, the function does not return a value.

Case 2: The function returns the length of `tup`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` that may contain a tuple as one of its elements and return either the index of the first tuple element found or the length of `tup`, depending on the conditions met.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup, a tuple that may contain a tuple as one of its elements, and returns either the index of the first tuple element found or the length of tup.**
