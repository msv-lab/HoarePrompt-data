Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the functionality of the function.

The function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as input and returns the count of non-tuple elements before the first tuple element in the tuple.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, I notice that the loop breaks as soon as it encounters a tuple element, and the count is returned. This means that if the tuple contains only tuple elements, the count will be 0. Additionally, if the tuple is empty, the loop will not execute, and the count will also be 0.

The annotations mention that the tuple contains at least one tuple element, but the code does not enforce this constraint. Therefore, I will include the edge case where the tuple is empty or contains only non-tuple elements in the functionality.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and returns the count of non-tuple elements before the first tuple element. If the tuple is empty or contains only non-tuple elements, the function returns 0. If the tuple contains only tuple elements, the function also returns 0. **
