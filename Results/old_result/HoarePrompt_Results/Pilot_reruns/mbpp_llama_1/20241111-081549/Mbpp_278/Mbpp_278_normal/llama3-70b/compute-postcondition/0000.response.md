To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the state of `tup` and the loop variable `elem`. Here's the step-by-step analysis:

* The loop will execute if `tup` contains at least one element.
* Since `tup` is already stated to contain at least one tuple element, we can confirm that the loop will execute.
* At the start of the loop, `elem` should be the first element of the tuple `tup`.

State: **tup is a tuple that contains at least one tuple element, elem is the first element of tup**
