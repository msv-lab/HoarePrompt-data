Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple that contains at least three tuple elements, `elem` is the third element of `tup`. If `elem` is a tuple, the function returns the index of `elem` in `tup`, which is 2. Otherwise, the function does not return any value, leaving the state of `tup` and `elem` unchanged.***
