Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple that contains at least two tuple elements, `elem` is the second element of `tup`. If `elem` is a tuple, the function returns the index of `elem` in `tup`, which is 1. If `elem` is not a tuple, the function does not return any value, maintaining the initial state of `tup` and `elem`.***
