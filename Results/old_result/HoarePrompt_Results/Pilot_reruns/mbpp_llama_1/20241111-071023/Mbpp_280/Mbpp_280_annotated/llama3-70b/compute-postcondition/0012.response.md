The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `elem`. `arr` is a list, and `elem` is any type of object. After executing the function body, the function's return value is determined by two cases:

Case 1: If `arr` is not empty and `elem` is found in `arr`, the function returns `True` and the index `i` of the matching element. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function does not return any value. If `arr` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return any value.

Case 2: If Case 1 is not fulfilled, the function returns `False` and `-1`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an object `elem`, and return `True` along with the index of the matching element if `elem` is found in `arr`, or `False` and `-1` if `elem` is not found in `arr` or if `arr` is empty.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `arr` and an object `elem`, and returns `True` along with the index of the matching element if `elem` is found in `arr`, or `False` and `-1` if `elem` is not found in `arr` or if `arr` is empty.**
