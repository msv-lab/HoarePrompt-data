Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr` and `element`. 

The function iterates over the elements of `arr` using the `enumerate` function, which returns both the index and the value of each element.

If the function finds an element in `arr` that is equal to `element`, it returns `True` and the index of that element.

If the function does not find `element` in `arr`, it returns `False` and `-1`.

However, the annotations mention that if `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return any value. But this is not accurate. In Python, if a function does not explicitly return a value, it will return `None` by default. But in this case, the function has a return statement at the end that returns `False` and `-1`, so it will always return a value, even if `arr` is an empty list.

So, the functionality of the function is to search for an element in a list and return whether it was found and its index if found. If the element is not found, it returns `False` and `-1`. This includes the case where the list is empty.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `arr` and an element, returns `True` and the index of the element if found in the list, otherwise returns `False` and `-1`, including the case where the list is empty. **
