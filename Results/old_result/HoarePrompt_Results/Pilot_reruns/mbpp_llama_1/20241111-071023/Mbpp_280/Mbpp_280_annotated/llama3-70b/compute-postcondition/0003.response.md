According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `arr`. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 1 element, `i` is 0, and `x` is the first element in the list `arr`. Since `x` is not equal to `elem` (otherwise the function would have returned), the loop needs to execute again. For the loop to execute again, `arr` must have at least 2 elements, `i` must be 1, and `x` must be the second element in the list `arr`.

State: **`arr` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is 1, and `x` is the second element in the list `arr`.**
