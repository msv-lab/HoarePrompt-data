The function returns `True` and `index`. The value of `index` is 0. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `index` is 0, `value` is the first element of `arr`, `element` is any type of object that can be compared to the elements of `arr` for equality, and the function returns `True` and `index` which is 0.
