Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, and `x` is the third element in the list `arr`. If `x` is equal to `elem`, the function returns `True` and `i` (which is 2). Otherwise, the function does not return any specific value, maintaining the original state of `arr`, `i`, and `x`.***
