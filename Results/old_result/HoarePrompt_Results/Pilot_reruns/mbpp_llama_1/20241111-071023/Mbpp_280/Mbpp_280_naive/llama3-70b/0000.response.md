Correctness: **True**.

I have analyzed the provided Python program and found that it correctly implements the described functionality. The function `func_1` takes an array `arr` and an element `elem` as input and returns a tuple containing a boolean indicating whether the element is in the array and the index position of the element (or -1 if the element is not found).

The program uses the `enumerate` function to iterate over the array, which provides both the index `i` and the value `x` of each element. If the current element `x` matches the target element `elem`, the function immediately returns a tuple containing `True` and the index `i`. If the loop completes without finding a match, the function returns a tuple containing `False` and -1.

I have considered various potential cases, including:

* The element is present in the array at a specific index.
* The element is not present in the array.
* The array is empty.
* The element is a duplicate in the array (the function will return the index of the first occurrence).

In all these cases, the program behaves correctly according to the problem description. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
