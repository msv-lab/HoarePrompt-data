Based on the loop code and the output states after the loop executes a few times, I can determine the loop's output state.

The loop's functionality is to iterate over the list `arr` and check if any element is equal to the value `element`. If a match is found, the function returns `True` and the index of the matching element.

Output State: **The function returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element` in `arr` if `element` is found in `arr`. If `element` is not found in `arr`, the function's behavior is undefined, but `arr` and `element` remain unchanged. If `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and the function's behavior is undefined.**

In more detail:

* If `arr` is a non-empty list and `element` is found in `arr`, the function returns `True` and the index of the first occurrence of `element`.
* If `arr` is a non-empty list and `element` is not found in `arr`, the function's behavior is undefined, but `arr` and `element` remain unchanged.
* If `arr` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and the function's behavior is undefined.

Note that the code is missing a return statement for the case where `element` is not found in `arr`. This could be considered a missing logic or edge case that the code is not handling. A possible fix would be to add a return statement at the end of the function, for example, `return False, -1` to indicate that `element` was not found in `arr`.
