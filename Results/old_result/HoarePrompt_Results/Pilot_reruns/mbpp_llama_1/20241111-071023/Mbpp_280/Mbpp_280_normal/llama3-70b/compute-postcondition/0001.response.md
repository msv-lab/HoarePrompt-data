The function returns `True` and the value of `i`. The value of `i` is 0. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is `arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `arr`, and the function returns `True` and 0.

Output State: **`arr` is a list with at least 1 element, `i` is 0, `x` is the first element of `arr`, and the function returns `True` and 0**
