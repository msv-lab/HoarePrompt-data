Postcondition: ***`arr` is a list with at least 3 elements, `element` is a value that can be compared to the elements of `arr` for equality, and `index` is 2. If the value at index 2 of `arr` equals `element`, the function returns `True` and 2; otherwise, the function's behavior is undefined.***

Note that I've added "the function's behavior is undefined" to cover the case where the value at index 2 of `arr` does not equal `element`, since there is no else part in the code to specify what happens in this case. This is an important edge case to consider, as it ensures that the postcondition accurately reflects the possible outcomes of the program.
