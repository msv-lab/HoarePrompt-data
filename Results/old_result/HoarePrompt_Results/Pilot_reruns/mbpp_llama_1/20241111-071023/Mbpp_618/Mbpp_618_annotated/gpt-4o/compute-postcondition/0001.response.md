The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`. Both `list1` and `list2` are lists of the same length, containing only numbers, and `list2` does not contain any zero. After executing the function body, the function returns a list of floats, where each float is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`.
