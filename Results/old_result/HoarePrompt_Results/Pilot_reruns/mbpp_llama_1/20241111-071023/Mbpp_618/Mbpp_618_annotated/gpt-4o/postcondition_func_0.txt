The function accepts two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a list of floats, where each float is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`. If the lists are of unequal length, the function ignores the remaining elements in the longer list. If a zero is encountered in `list2`, the function raises a `ZeroDivisionError`.
