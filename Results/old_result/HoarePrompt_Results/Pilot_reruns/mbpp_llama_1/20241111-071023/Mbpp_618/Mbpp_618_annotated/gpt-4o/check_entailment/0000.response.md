Correctness: **True**

The code follows the problem description for every potential case. The function `func_1` takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input and returns a list of floats, where each float is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`. The function uses the `zip` function to iterate over the two lists in parallel, which means that if the lists are of unequal length, the function will ignore the remaining elements in the longer list.

The annotations provided with the code are consistent with the code's behavior. The annotation states that the function returns a list of floats, where each float is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`, and that if a zero is encountered in `list2`, the function raises a `ZeroDivisionError`. This is indeed what the code does.

The problem description does not provide any examples, but based on the code and the annotations, it seems that the function is designed to handle all possible cases. The function will correctly divide corresponding elements from the two lists, and it will raise an error if a zero is encountered in the second list.

The annotations influenced my reasoning by providing additional information about the code's behavior. They helped me understand what the code is supposed to do and what edge cases it is supposed to handle. However, I also double-checked the code to make sure that it actually behaves as described in the annotations, and I did not find any discrepancies.
