To solve this task, let's break down the given code and initial state.

The initial state is: `list1` and `list2` are lists of the same length, containing only numbers, and `list2` does not contain any zero.

The given code is a return statement that uses a list comprehension to create a new list. This list comprehension iterates over the pairs of elements from `list1` and `list2` using the `zip` function, and for each pair, it calculates the division of the element from `list1` by the element from `list2`.

Since `list2` does not contain any zero, the division operation will not raise any `ZeroDivisionError`. The result of the division will be a floating-point number (even if the result is an integer, because in Python 3, the `/` operator always returns a float).

The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state of `list1` and `list2` remains the same. However, the function returns a new list containing the results of the divisions.

Therefore, the output state is: `list1` and `list2` are lists of the same length, containing only numbers, and `list2` does not contain any zero, and the function returns a list of floats, where each float is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of the same length, containing only numbers, and `list2` does not contain any zero, and the function returns a list of floats, where each float is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`.**
