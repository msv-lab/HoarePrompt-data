Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the function should divide two lists element-wise, but it does not specify what should happen if the lists contain non-numeric values or if the second list contains zeros. However, the code annotations suggest that the function may raise a `TypeError` or a `ZeroDivisionError` in these cases.

However, the code does not actually check for these cases, and will raise an exception if it encounters a non-numeric value or a zero in the second list. This is not explicitly stated in the problem description, and therefore the code does not meet the requirements.

In particular, if the input lists contain non-numeric values, the code will raise a `TypeError` when it tries to perform the division, but the problem description does not mention this possibility. Similarly, if the second list contains zeros, the code will raise a `ZeroDivisionError`, but again this is not mentioned in the problem description.

The annotations were helpful in pointing out these potential issues, but upon closer inspection, it appears that the code does not actually handle these cases correctly.

For example, if we call the function with the lists `[1, 2, 'a']` and `[2, 3, 4]`, the code will raise a `TypeError` when it tries to divide `'a'` by `4`, but the problem description does not specify what should happen in this case.

Similarly, if we call the function with the lists `[1, 2, 3]` and `[2, 3, 0]`, the code will raise a `ZeroDivisionError` when it tries to divide `3` by `0`, but again the problem description does not mention this possibility.

Therefore, the code does not meet the requirements of the problem description, and the correctness is **False**.
