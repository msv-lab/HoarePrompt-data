The function returns a new list that contains the division of corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`. Since `list2` does not contain any zeros, the division operation will not raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. The state of `list1` and `list2` remains unchanged. The function returns a new list with the division results.

Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists of numbers, `list2` does not contain any zeros, and the function returns a new list with the division results of corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`.**
