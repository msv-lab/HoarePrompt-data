To solve this task, let's break it down step by step.

1. The code uses a list comprehension to create a new list.
2. The `zip(list1, list2)` function pairs corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2` together.
3. For each pair `(a, b)`, the expression `a / b` is evaluated, where `a` is an element from `list1` and `b` is the corresponding element from `list2`.
4. Since `list2` does not contain any zeros, the division `a / b` is always valid.
5. The results of these divisions are collected into a new list.
6. The `return` statement returns this new list.

Given that `list1` and `list2` are lists of the same length, containing only numbers, and `list2` does not contain any zeros, the output state will be a new list containing the results of the divisions.

Output State: **A new list is returned, where each element is the result of dividing the corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`.**
