Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are expected to be lists of numbers. The function first checks if the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are equal. If they are not, it raises a `ValueError` with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length'.

If the lengths are equal, the function uses a list comprehension to create a new list containing the division results of corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`. The `zip` function is used to iterate over the two lists in parallel.

However, there is a potential edge case that is not handled by the function: what if `list2` contains a zero? In this case, the division operation would raise a `ZeroDivisionError`. The annotations suggest that `list2` does not contain any zeros, but the code does not explicitly check for this condition.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two lists of numbers, `list1` and `list2`, and returns a new list with the division results of corresponding elements from `list1` and `list2`, provided that `list1` and `list2` have the same length and `list2` does not contain any zeros. If the lengths are not equal, it raises a `ValueError`. If `list2` contains a zero, it raises a `ZeroDivisionError`. **
