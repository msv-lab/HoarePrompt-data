Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 3 sublists, and `max_length` is the maximum length among the first three sublists in `list_of_lists`. Specifically, if the length of the third sublist is greater than the initial `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of the third sublist; otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
