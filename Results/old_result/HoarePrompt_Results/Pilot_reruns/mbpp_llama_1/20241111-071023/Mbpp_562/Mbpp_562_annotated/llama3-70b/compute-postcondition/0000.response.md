To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code snippet.

The code `return max(len(sublist) for sublist in lists)` is designed to find the maximum length of sublists within the list `lists`. Here's how it works:

1. `for sublist in lists` iterates over each sublist in the list `lists`.
2. `len(sublist)` calculates the length of each sublist.
3. `max(...)` finds the maximum length among all sublists.

Since the initial state only mentions that `lists` is a list of lists, without providing specific values, we can't determine the exact maximum length. However, we can describe the output state based on the given information.

The function returns the maximum length of sublists in `lists`. The state of `lists` remains unchanged, as the code only reads from it without modifying it.

Output State: **`lists` is a list of lists, and the function returns the maximum length of sublists in `lists`.**
