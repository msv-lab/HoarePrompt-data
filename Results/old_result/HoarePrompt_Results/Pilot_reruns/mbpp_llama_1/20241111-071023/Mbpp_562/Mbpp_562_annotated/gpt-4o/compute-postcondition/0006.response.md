Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `max_length` is either 0 or the length of the first or second sublist in `list_of_lists` if it is greater than the initial `max_length` of 0, and `sublist` is the second sublist in `list_of_lists`. If the length of the second sublist is greater than `max_length`, `max_length` is updated to the length of the second sublist; otherwise, `max_length` remains unchanged.***
