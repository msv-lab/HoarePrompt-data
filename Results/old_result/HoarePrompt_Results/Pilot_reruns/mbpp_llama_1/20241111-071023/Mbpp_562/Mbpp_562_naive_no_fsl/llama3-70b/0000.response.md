Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The provided Python function `func_1` is designed to find the length of the longest sublist in a given list of lists. The function uses a generator expression to iterate over each sublist in the input list and calculate its length using the built-in `len` function. The `max` function is then used to find the maximum length among all sublists.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles:

* Empty input lists: `func_1([])` returns 0, which is the expected result.
* Lists with empty sublists: `func_1([[], [1, 2], [3]])` returns 2, which is the expected result.
* Lists with sublists of varying lengths: `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4, 5], [6]])` returns 3, which is the expected result.
* Lists with duplicate maximum-length sublists: `func_1([[1, 2], [3, 4], [5, 6]])` returns 2, which is the expected result.

Overall, the function appears to be correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
