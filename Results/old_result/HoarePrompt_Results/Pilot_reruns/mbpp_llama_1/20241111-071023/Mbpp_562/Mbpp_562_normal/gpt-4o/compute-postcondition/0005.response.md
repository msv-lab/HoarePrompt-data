The code `max_length = len(sublist)` updates the value of `max_length` to be the length of the `sublist`. 

In the initial state, `max_length` is the maximum of its initial value and the length of the first sublist, and `sublist` is the second sublist in the list.

After execution, `max_length` is updated to be the length of the `sublist`, which is the second sublist in the list. The states of the other variables, `list_of_lists`, are not affected.

Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `max_length` is the length of the second sublist, and `sublist` is the second sublist in the list.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `max_length` is the length of the second sublist, and `sublist` is the second sublist in the list**
