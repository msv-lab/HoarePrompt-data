Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct. It rotates the binary string `num_rotations` positions to the right, converts the resulting string to an integer, and checks if the integer is odd. The code handles all possible cases, including when `num_rotations` is greater than the length of `binary_str`, as it effectively rotates by `num_rotations % len(binary_str)` positions.

The output hints agree with the code and do not provide any additional cases that the code does not handle. The code correctly counts the number of times the resulting integer value is odd during the rotations and returns the count.

The provided unit tests also support the correctness of the code, as they cover different scenarios and the code passes all of them. 

Therefore, based on the code, problem description, and output hints, I conclude that the code is correct and follows the problem description for every potential case.
