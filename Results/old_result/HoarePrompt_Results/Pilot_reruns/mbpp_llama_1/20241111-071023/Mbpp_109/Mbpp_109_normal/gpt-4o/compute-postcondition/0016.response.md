To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `binary_str` is rotated one position to the right.
- `num_rotations` is at least 3.
- `integer_value` is the new integer value of the rotated `binary_str`.
- `count` is either 1 or 2 if `integer_value` is odd, or remains 0 or 1 if `integer_value` is even.

Loop statement:
```
for _ in range(num_rotations):
    # the loop body is omitted
```

For the loop to execute one more time, it depends on the variable `num_rotations`. Since `_` is a throwaway variable and does not affect the loop's continuation, we focus on `num_rotations`.

At the end of the last iteration, `num_rotations` is at least 3. However, for the loop to execute again, it needs to be ensured that there are indeed more iterations to go through. Since one iteration has already passed, `num_rotations` must be adjusted to reflect that there are at least 2 more iterations left for the loop to potentially execute again.

Adjusting the states:
- `num_rotations` needs to be adjusted to be at least 2 more than its current minimum to ensure the loop can execute again. Since it was at least 3, now it must be at least 4 to guarantee at least one more iteration.

Other states (`binary_str`, `integer_value`, `count`) do not directly affect the loop's ability to execute again based on the given loop statement. Therefore, they do not need to be adjusted for the purpose of determining if the loop can execute one more time.

State: **`binary_str` is rotated one position to the right, `num_rotations` is at least 4, `integer_value` is the new integer value of the rotated `binary_str`, `count` is either 0, 1, or 2.**
