The function func_1 accepts two parameters: a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`. According to the code, it rotates the binary string `num_rotations` positions to the right and counts the number of times the resulting integer value is odd during the rotations.

However, upon closer inspection, we can see that the code does not handle cases where `num_rotations` is greater than the length of `binary_str`. In such cases, the rotation operation would be equivalent to rotating the string by `num_rotations % len(binary_str)` positions.

Additionally, the code does not check if the input `binary_str` is indeed a binary string consisting only of 0s and 1s. If the input string contains other characters, the `int(binary_str, 2)` conversion would raise a ValueError.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to rotate a binary string `num_rotations` positions to the right, count the number of times the resulting integer value is odd during the rotations, and return the count, assuming the input string is a valid binary string and `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. If `num_rotations` is greater than the length of `binary_str`, the rotation is equivalent to rotating by `num_rotations % len(binary_str)` positions.
