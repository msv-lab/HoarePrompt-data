Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I understand that the function `func_1` accepts a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's and a positive integer `n`. The function repeats the string `s` `n // len(s) + 1` times and then counts the total number of '1's in all substrings of the repeated string, modulo 2.

However, upon closer inspection of the code, I notice that the function only counts the '1's in substrings of length `len(s)` and does not consider substrings of other lengths. Additionally, the function does not handle the case where `n` is not a positive integer.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `s` consisting of '0's and '1's and an integer `n`, repeats the string `s` `n // len(s) + 1` times, and returns the total count of '1's in all substrings of length `len(s)` of the repeated string, modulo 2. If `n` is 0 or negative, the function returns 0. If `n` is not an integer, the function's behavior is undefined. **
