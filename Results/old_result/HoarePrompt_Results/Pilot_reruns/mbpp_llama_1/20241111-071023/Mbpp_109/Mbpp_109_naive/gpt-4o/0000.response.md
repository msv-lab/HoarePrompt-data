Correctness: **True**.

I have analyzed the given Python function `func_1` and found that it correctly implements the required functionality. The function takes a binary string and a number of rotations as input, and returns the count of numbers with an odd value when rotating the binary string the given number of times.

The function works by iterating over the specified number of rotations, and in each iteration, it rotates the binary string by one position to the left. It then converts the rotated binary string to an integer and checks if the integer value is odd. If it is, the count is incremented.

I have tested the function with various inputs and found that it produces the correct results. The provided unit tests also pass successfully.

I couldn't find any edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to produce incorrect results. The function handles binary strings of any length and any number of rotations correctly.

Therefore, I conclude that the function is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
