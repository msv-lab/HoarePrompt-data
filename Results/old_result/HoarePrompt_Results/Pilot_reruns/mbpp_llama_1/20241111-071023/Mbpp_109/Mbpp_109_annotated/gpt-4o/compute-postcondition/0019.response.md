The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str` and `num_rotations`. `binary_str` is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, and `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the function rotates `binary_str` to the right by `num_rotations` positions, counts the number of times the rotated `binary_str` has an odd integer value, and returns this count. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string and a non-negative integer, rotate the binary string to the right by the specified number of positions, and return the count of rotated strings with an odd integer value.

Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string and a non-negative integer, rotates the binary string to the right by the specified number of positions, and returns the count of rotated strings with an odd integer value.**
