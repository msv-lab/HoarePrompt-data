According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `num_rotations`. If `num_rotations` is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `binary_str` is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, and `count` is 0 does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `num_rotations` is greater than 0.

State: **`binary_str` is a string consisting of only '0's and '1's, `num_rotations` is greater than 0, `count` is 0**
