Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description. It correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the input string.

Here's why the code is correct:

1. The program uses the `find` and `rfind` methods to find the first and last indices of the given character in the string. If the character is not found, these methods return -1.
2. The program checks if the first and last indices are -1 or if they are the same (i.e., the character appears only once in the string). If so, it returns the original string, as there is nothing to remove.
3. If the first and last indices are different, the program uses string slicing to remove the first and last occurrences of the character. It returns the resulting string.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the program. The function behaves correctly for different inputs, including cases where the character appears multiple times, only once, or not at all.

After analyzing the code, I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
