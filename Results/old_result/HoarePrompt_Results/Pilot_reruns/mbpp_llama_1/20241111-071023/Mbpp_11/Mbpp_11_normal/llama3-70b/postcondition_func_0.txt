The function accepts a string `s` and a character `c`, and returns the modified string `s` with the first and last occurrences of `c` removed if `c` is found at both occurrences, otherwise returns the original string `s`. If `c` is an empty string or `s` is an empty string, the function returns the original string `s`. If `c` is a substring of `s` that appears multiple times, the function only removes the first and last occurrences of `c`.
