The function returns a string that is a modified version of `s`. The string is constructed by concatenating three parts: 
- the substring of `s` from the beginning to the index of the first occurrence of `c` (exclusive), 
- the substring of `s` from the index after the first occurrence of `c` to the index of the last occurrence of `c` (exclusive), 
- the substring of `s` from the index after the last occurrence of `c` to the end.

The states of the variables `s`, `c`, `first_occ`, and `last_occ` are not changed, so the output state is: 
`s` is a string, 
`c` is a character, 
`first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found, 
`last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found, 
and the function returns the modified string.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s` or -1 if `c` is not found, and the function returns the modified string.**
