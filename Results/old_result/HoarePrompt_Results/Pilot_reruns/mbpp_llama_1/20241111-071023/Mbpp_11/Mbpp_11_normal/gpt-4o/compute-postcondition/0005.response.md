The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a string, and `ch`, which is a single character that is present at least once in `s`. After executing the function body, the function returns a string. There are two cases:

Case 1: If `ch` does not occur in `s` or occurs only once in `s`, the function returns `s` unchanged.

Case 2: If `ch` occurs more than once in `s`, the function modifies `s` by removing the characters at the indices of the first and last occurrences of `ch` and returns the modified string.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a single character `ch` that is present at least once in `s`, and return the original string if `ch` occurs only once or not at all, or return a modified string with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed if `ch` occurs more than once.

Functionality: **The function accepts a string `s` and a single character `ch` that is present at least once in `s`, and returns the original string if `ch` occurs only once or not at all, or returns a modified string with the first and last occurrences of `ch` removed if `ch` occurs more than once.**
