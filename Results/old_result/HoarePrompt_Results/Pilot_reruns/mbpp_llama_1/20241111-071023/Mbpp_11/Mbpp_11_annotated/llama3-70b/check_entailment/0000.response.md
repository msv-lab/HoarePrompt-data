Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The problem description states that the function should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. However, the code removes all occurrences of the character between the first and last occurrence, not just the first and last occurrence.

The annotations suggest that the function returns a string that is `s` with all occurrences of `c` removed, which is not what the problem description states. The annotations also mention that the function does not remove all occurrences of `c` from the string `s`, but only the first and last ones, which is correct. However, the code does not implement this correctly.

For example, if the input string is "abca" and the character is "a", the function should return "bc", but the code will return "bca" because it removes all occurrences of "a" between the first and last occurrence, not just the first and last occurrence.

The annotations influenced my reasoning by highlighting the discrepancy between the code's behavior and the problem description. They also provided a clear explanation of what the code is supposed to do, which made it easier to identify the mistake.
