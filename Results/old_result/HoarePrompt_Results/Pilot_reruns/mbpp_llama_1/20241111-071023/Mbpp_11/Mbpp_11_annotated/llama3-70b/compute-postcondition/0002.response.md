The function returns a string that is a modified version of `s`. The string is constructed by concatenating three parts: 

1. `s[:first_occ]`: This part includes all characters in `s` before the first occurrence of `c`.
2. `s[first_occ + 1:last_occ]`: This part includes all characters in `s` between the first and last occurrences of `c`, excluding the first and last occurrences themselves.
3. `s[last_occ + 1:]`: This part includes all characters in `s` after the last occurrence of `c`.

The return statement does not change the state of `s`, `c`, `first_occ`, or `last_occ`. 

Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`, and the function returns a string that is `s` with all occurrences of `c` removed.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `c` is a character, `first_occ` is the index of the first occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`, `last_occ` is the index of the last occurrence of `c` in `s`, or -1 if `c` is not found in `s`, and the function returns a string that is `s` with all occurrences of `c` removed.**
