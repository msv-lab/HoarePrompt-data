Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `ch` is a string of length 1, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, and `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`. If `ch` does not occur in `s` or occurs only once, the function returns `s` as is. Otherwise, the function's behavior is not specified in the given code fragment, implying that further operations may be performed on `s` when `ch` occurs more than once.***
