Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly implement the function to remove lowercase substrings from a given string. The program only removes individual lowercase characters, not substrings. For example, if the input string is 'aBCdef', the program will return 'BC', but it should return 'BCdef' because 'a' is a single lowercase character, not a substring.

The program should iterate over the string and check for sequences of lowercase characters, not just individual characters. A correct implementation would use a loop to check for sequences of lowercase characters and remove them from the string.

Here's an example of a correct implementation:
```python
def func_1(s: str) -> str:
    result = ''
    lowercase_substring = ''
    for char in s:
        if char.islower():
            lowercase_substring += char
        else:
            if lowercase_substring:
                lowercase_substring = ''
            result += char
    return result
```
This implementation correctly removes lowercase substrings from the input string.
