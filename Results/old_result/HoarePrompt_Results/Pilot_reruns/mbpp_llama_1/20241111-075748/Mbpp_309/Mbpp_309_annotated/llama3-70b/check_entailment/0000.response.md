Correctness: **True**

I believe the code is correct because it directly uses the built-in Python function `max()` to find the maximum of two numbers, which is exactly what the problem description requires. The annotations provided also accurately describe the behavior of the function, stating that it returns the maximum of `a` and `b`.

The annotations did not provide any edge cases that the code does not cover, and I couldn't think of any potential case where the code would not work as expected. The function is simple and straightforward, and the use of the `max()` function ensures that it will always return the correct result.

The problem description does not provide any specific examples, but based on the code and the annotations, I am confident that the function will work correctly for all possible inputs. For example, if `a` is 5 and `b` is 10, the function will return 10, which is the maximum of the two numbers. Similarly, if `a` is 10 and `b` is 5, the function will also return 10.
