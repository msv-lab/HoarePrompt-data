Correctness: **False**

Explanation: The code seems to be incorrect and does not follow the problem description. The problem description asks to write a python function to convert complex numbers to polar coordinates, but the code only handles real numbers (integers) as input. The function `func_1` takes a single argument `num` and converts it to a complex number with zero imaginary part, and then uses `cmath.polar` to convert it to polar coordinates. However, this approach does not work for complex numbers with non-zero imaginary parts.

For example, if the input is a complex number like `3+4j`, the function will not work correctly because it will ignore the imaginary part. The output hints also mention that the function may raise a ValueError or TypeError if the input is not a valid complex number, but this is not handled in the code.

To make the code correct, it should accept complex numbers as input and handle them correctly. For example, it could use the `cmath` module to convert the complex number to polar coordinates, like this: `cmath.polar(complex(num))`. However, this would still require the input to be a string in the format "a+bj", where a and b are the real and imaginary parts of the complex number, respectively.

The code also has unnecessary assertions at the beginning and end, which are not part of the function definition. These assertions are testing the function with specific inputs, but they do not provide any additional information about the correctness of the function.
