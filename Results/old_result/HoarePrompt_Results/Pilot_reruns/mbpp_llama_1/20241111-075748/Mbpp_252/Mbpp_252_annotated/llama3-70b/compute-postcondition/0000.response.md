To solve this task, let's analyze the code step by step.


The code `return abs(c), cmath.phase(c)` returns two values: the absolute value of `c` and the phase of `c`. The absolute value of a complex number `c = a + bj` is `abs(c) = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`, and the phase is `cmath.phase(c) = atan2(b, a)`.


Since `c` is a complex number, we can represent it as `c = a + bj`, where `a` and `b` are real numbers.


Now, let's calculate the output state.


The absolute value of `c` is `abs(c) = sqrt(a^2 + b^2)`, which is a real number.


The phase of `c` is `cmath.phase(c) = atan2(b, a)`, which is also a real number.


Therefore, the function returns two real numbers: `abs(c)` and `cmath.phase(c)`.


The output state is: `c` is a complex number, and the function returns `abs(c)` and `cmath.phase(c)`.


Output State: **`c` is a complex number, and the function returns `abs(c)` and `cmath.phase(c)`**
