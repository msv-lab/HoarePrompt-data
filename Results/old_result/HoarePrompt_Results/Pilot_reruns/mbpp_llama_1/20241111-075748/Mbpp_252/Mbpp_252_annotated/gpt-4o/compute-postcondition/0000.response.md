The function returns `cmath.polar(complex(num))`, where `num` is a complex number. `cmath.polar` converts a complex number into its polar form, which is a tuple of the magnitude (or length) and the phase angle of the complex number.

Output State: **`num` is a complex number, and the function returns a tuple of the magnitude and phase angle of `num`.**
