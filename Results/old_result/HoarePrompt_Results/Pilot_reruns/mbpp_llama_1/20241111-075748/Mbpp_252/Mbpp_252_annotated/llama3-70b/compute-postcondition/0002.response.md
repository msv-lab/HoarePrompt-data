Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I understand that the function `func_1` accepts a complex number `c` as input and returns its absolute value and phase.

Upon reviewing the code, I notice that it directly returns the absolute value and phase of the complex number `c` using the `abs` and `cmath.phase` functions, respectively. The annotations accurately describe the behavior of the code.

However, I also consider potential edge cases, such as:

* What if the input `c` is not a complex number? The code does not include any error handling or input validation. In this case, the function may raise a TypeError or produce unexpected results.
* What if the input `c` is a complex number with a zero magnitude (i.e., `c` is a zero complex number)? The `cmath.phase` function may return `nan` (not a number) or raise a ValueError in this case.

Considering these potential edge cases, I provide a concise summary of the function's functionality:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a complex number `c` and returns its absolute value and phase. However, it does not perform input validation, and may raise a TypeError or produce unexpected results if `c` is not a complex number. Additionally, if `c` is a zero complex number, the function may return `nan` or raise a ValueError for the phase value. **
