To calculate the output state, let's analyze the given code and initial state step by step.

1. The initial state mentions that `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements, and `first_elements` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`.

2. The code snippet is a list comprehension that iterates over each sublist in `list_of_lists` and extracts the second element (`sublist[1]`) from each sublist.

3. The extracted second elements are collected into a new list called `second_elements`.

4. Since `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with exactly two elements each, `sublist[1]` will always refer to the second element of each sublist.

5. The state of `list_of_lists` and `first_elements` remains unchanged because the code only reads from `list_of_lists` and does not modify it.

6. The output state includes the new list `second_elements`, which contains the second element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Given the initial state and the code's operation, the output state is as follows:

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements; `first_elements` is a list containing the first element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`; `second_elements` is a list containing the second element of each sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
