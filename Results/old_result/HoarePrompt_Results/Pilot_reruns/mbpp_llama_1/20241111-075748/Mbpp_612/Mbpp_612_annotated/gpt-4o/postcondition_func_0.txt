The function accepts a list of lists, extracts the first and second elements of each sublist, and returns a list of two lists containing these elements. However, it assumes that each sublist has at least two elements and does not handle empty sublists or sublists with more than two elements, which may raise an IndexError. If the input list is empty, the function returns an empty list.
