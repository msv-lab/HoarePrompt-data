The function returns a list of two lists. The first list contains the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the second list contains the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. The state of `list_of_lists` is not changed. Therefore, the output state is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements, and the function returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the second list contains the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`.

Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists, where each sublist has exactly two elements, and the function returns a list of two lists, where the first list contains the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and the second list contains the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`.**
