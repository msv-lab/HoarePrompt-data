Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly implements the described behavior. It takes a list of lists, where each sublist has two elements, and returns a list of two lists. The first list contains the first element of each sublist, and the second list contains the second element of each sublist.

The function uses generator expressions to iterate over the input list of lists and extract the first and second elements of each sublist. The resulting lists are then returned as a list of two lists.

I have considered various potential cases, including:

* An empty input list: The function correctly returns a list of two empty lists.
* A list with a single sublist: The function correctly returns a list of two lists, each containing a single element.
* A list with multiple sublists: The function correctly returns a list of two lists, each containing the corresponding elements from the sublists.
* A list with sublists of different lengths: The function correctly raises a `IndexError` when trying to access the second element of a sublist with only one element.

In all cases, the function behaves as described in the problem statement. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
