Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `elem`. The annotation states that `tup` is a tuple and `elem` is any hashable type.

The function returns the count of `elem` in `tup` using the `count` method.

Looking at the code, it seems that the annotation accurately describes the functionality of the code. The `count` method will return the number of occurrences of `elem` in `tup`.

However, we should consider potential edge cases. What if `tup` is not a tuple? What if `elem` is not hashable? The code does not handle these cases explicitly, but the `count` method will raise a `TypeError` if `tup` is not a sequence or if `elem` is not hashable.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to return the count of `elem` in `tup` if `tup` is a tuple and `elem` is hashable. If `tup` is not a tuple or `elem` is not hashable, the function will raise a `TypeError`.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple `tup` and a hashable element `elem`, and returns the count of `elem` in `tup`. If `tup` is not a tuple or `elem` is not hashable, the function raises a `TypeError`. **
