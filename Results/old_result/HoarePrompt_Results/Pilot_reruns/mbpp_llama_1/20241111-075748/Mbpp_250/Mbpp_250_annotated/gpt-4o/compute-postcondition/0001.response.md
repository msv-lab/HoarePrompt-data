Let's break down the information step by step:

1. The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup` and `element`.
2. `tup` is a tuple, which means it's a collection of objects that can be of any data type, including strings, integers, floats, etc.
3. `element` is an object that can be compared with elements of `tup` for equality, which means it can be of any data type that can be compared with the elements of `tup`.

Now, let's analyze the output:

1. The function returns the count of `element` in `tup`, which means it returns an integer value representing the number of times `element` appears in `tup`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and an object `element` that can be compared with elements of `tup`, and return the count of `element` in `tup`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an object `element` that can be compared with elements of `tup`, and returns the count of `element` in `tup`.**
