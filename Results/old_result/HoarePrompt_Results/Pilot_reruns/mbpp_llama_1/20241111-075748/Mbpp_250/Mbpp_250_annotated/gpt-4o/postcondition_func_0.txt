The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an object `element` that can be compared with elements of `tup` for equality, and returns the count of `element` in `tup`. However, if `tup` is not a tuple, the function will raise an `AttributeError`. Additionally, if `element` is not comparable with elements of `tup`, the function will raise a `TypeError`.
