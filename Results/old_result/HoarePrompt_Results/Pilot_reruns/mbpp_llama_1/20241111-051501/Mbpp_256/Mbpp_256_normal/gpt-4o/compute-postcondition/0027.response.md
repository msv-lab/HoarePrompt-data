To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `range(i * i, n, i)`, which means the loop will iterate over the range of numbers starting from `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 4, `j` is 16, and `n` is greater than 16. 

For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by `i` (which is 4) to the next value in the range. Therefore, `j` should be 20.

Additionally, since `i` is used as the step in the range, it remains the same.

The state of `is_prime` list does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute again, as its values are not used in the loop condition.

The state of `n` being greater than 16 is sufficient for the loop to execute again, as `n` is not changed by the loop.

State: **`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 4, `j` is 20, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, elements at indices that are multiples of 3 from 9 to `n` are `False`, and the element at index 16 is `False`, with the rest being `True`.**
