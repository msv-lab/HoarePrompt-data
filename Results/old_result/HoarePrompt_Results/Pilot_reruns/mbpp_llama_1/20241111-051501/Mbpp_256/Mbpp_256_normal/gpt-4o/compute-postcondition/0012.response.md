The loop's functionality is to mark the multiples of `i` as non-prime in the `is_prime` list, starting from `i * i` up to `n` with a step of `i`.

Output State: **The loop marks the multiples of `i` as non-prime in the `is_prime` list, starting from `i * i` up to `n` with a step of `i`. `j` is the last multiple of `i` that is marked as non-prime. If `n` is less than `i * i`, the loop does not execute and the `is_prime` list remains unchanged.**

In more detail:

* `n` is greater than or equal to 4, as in the initial state.
* `i` is 2, as in the initial state.
* `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` are marked as `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`.
* `j` is the last multiple of `i` that is marked as non-prime, which is the last value in the range `range(i * i, n, i)`.
* If `n` is less than `i * i`, the loop does not execute, and the `is_prime` list remains unchanged, with the first two elements as `False` and the remaining elements as `True`.
