The value of `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`, and `j` is 16. The `is_prime` list already has `False` values at indices that are multiples of 3 from 9 to `n`, and the first two elements are `False`. Since 16 is not a multiple of 3, the value at index 16 was previously `True`, but now it is set to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 4, `j` is 16, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, elements at indices that are multiples of 3 from 9 to `n` are `False`, and the element at index 16 is `False`, with the rest being `True`.**
