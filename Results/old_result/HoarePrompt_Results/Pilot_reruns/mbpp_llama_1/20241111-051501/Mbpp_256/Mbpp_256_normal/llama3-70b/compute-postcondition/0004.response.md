Postcondition: ***`num` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 2. If `num` is divisible by `i`, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function does not return any value, indicating that `num` is not divisible by `i` (i.e., `num` is a prime number or has a prime factor greater than `i`).***
