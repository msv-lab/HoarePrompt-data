To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop iterates over the range `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. The current state is:

* `n` is greater than 8
* `i` is 2
* `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, the third and fourth elements are `True`, the fifth element is `False`, the sixth element is `True`, the seventh element is `False`, the eighth element is `True`, the ninth element is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`
* `j` is 8

For the loop to execute again, the next value of `j` should be within the range `i * i` to `n`. Since `i` is 2, the next value of `j` should be at least 10 (2 * 2 + 2 * 2). 

However, the current state of `j` is 8, which is less than 10. Therefore, the loop will not execute again with the current state of `j`. 

But since `j` is not the only state that affects the loop execution, we need to check if `i` can be adjusted to make the loop execute again. 

Since `i` is 2, the next value of `i` will be 3 (assuming `i` is incremented by 1). If `i` is 3, the range of the loop will be `3 * 3` to `n`, which is 9 to `n`. 

In this case, the loop will execute again if `n` is greater than 9. 

Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:

* `n` is greater than 9 (to ensure the loop executes again)
* `i` is 3 (to reflect the next iteration)
* `j` is 9 (to reflect the next value in the range)

The state of `is_prime` does not need to be adjusted as it is not directly related to the loop condition.

State: **`n` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, the third and fourth elements are `True`, the fifth element is `False`, the sixth element is `True`, the seventh element is `False`, the eighth element is `True`, the ninth element is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `j` is 9**
