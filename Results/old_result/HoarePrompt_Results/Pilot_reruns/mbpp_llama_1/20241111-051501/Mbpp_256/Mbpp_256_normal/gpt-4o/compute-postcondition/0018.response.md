Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code `is_prime[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the `j`-th index of the `is_prime` list. 

The initial state of the `is_prime` list is:
- The first two elements are `False`.
- The 10th element is `False`.
- The remaining elements (except the 10th) are `True`.

The value of `j` is 12, so the 12th element of the `is_prime` list is assigned the value `False`. 

The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, and the `is_prime` list has its first two elements set to `False`, the 10th element set to `False`, and the 12th element set to `False`, while the remaining elements (except the 10th and 12th) are `True`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, and the `is_prime` list has its first two elements set to `False`, the 10th element set to `False`, and the 12th element set to `False`, while the remaining elements (except the 10th and 12th) are `True`.**
