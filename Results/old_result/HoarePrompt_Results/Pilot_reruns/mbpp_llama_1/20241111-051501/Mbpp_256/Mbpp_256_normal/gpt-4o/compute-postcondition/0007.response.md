To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the loop statement and the given state.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i * i, n, i):`. This means the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range from `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`.

Given state:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 4
- `i` is 2
- `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, the third and fourth elements are `True`, the fifth element is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`
- `j` is 4

To execute the loop one more time, we need to adjust the state so that `j` is still within the range defined by `i * i` and `n`, and the step `i` is considered.

Since `i` is 2, `i * i` equals 4, which is the current value of `j`. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented by the step value `i`, which is 2. Thus, `j` should be 6 for the loop to execute one more time.

Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 4 and we are considering the loop executing again, `n` should be adjusted to be greater than 6 to ensure that the loop can indeed execute with `j` being 6.

The state of `is_prime` does not directly affect the loop's execution condition based on the provided loop statement. Therefore, it does not need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`n` is greater than 6, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, the third and fourth elements are `True`, the fifth element is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `j` is 6**
