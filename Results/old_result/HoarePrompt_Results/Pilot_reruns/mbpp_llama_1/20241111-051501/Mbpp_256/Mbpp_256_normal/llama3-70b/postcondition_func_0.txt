The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns the count of prime numbers between 2 and `n-1` (inclusive) if `n` is 2 or greater, otherwise returns 0. However, the function does not handle cases where `n` is not an integer or is negative, and it assumes that the `is_prime` function works correctly.
