To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze its functionality and the initial conditions provided.

The loop iterates over a range starting from `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`. For each iteration, it sets the `is_prime` list element at index `j` to `False`.

Given that `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 4, we can infer the following:

1. **Loop Execution**: The loop will execute if `i * i` is less than `n`. Since `i` is 3, `i * i` equals 9. Therefore, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 9.

2. **is_prime List Modifications**: For each iteration, the loop sets the `is_prime` list element at index `j` to `False`. The indices affected will be multiples of `i` (3) starting from `i * i` (9) up to `n`.

3. **Values of Variables After Loop Execution**:
   - `n` remains unchanged.
   - `i` remains unchanged at 3.
   - `j` will be the last multiple of `i` less than `n`, which depends on the value of `n`.
   - `is_prime` list will have its elements set to `False` for indices that are multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` to `n`. The first two elements are initially `False`, and the remaining elements (except those set to `False` by the loop) will remain `True`.

4. **Edge Cases**:
   - If `n` is less than or equal to 9, the loop will not execute because `i * i` (9) is not less than `n`. In this case, the `is_prime` list will remain unchanged except for the first two elements which are `False`.
   - If `n` equals 9, the loop will execute once, setting the 10th element of `is_prime` to `False`.

**Output State**: **If `n` is greater than 9, `j` will be the last multiple of 3 less than `n`, and the `is_prime` list will have its elements set to `False` for indices that are multiples of 3 starting from 9 to `n`, with the first two elements being `False` and the remaining elements (except those set to `False` by the loop) being `True`. If `n` is 9 or less, the loop does not execute, and the `is_prime` list remains unchanged except for the first two elements being `False`.**
