To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and the changes made to the state variables in the previous iteration.

The loop condition is `i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1)`, which means the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4. To determine if the loop will execute again, we need to check if `i` is still within the range of the loop condition.

Since `i` is 2, the next value of `i` will be 3. We need to check if 3 is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 4, the square root of `n` is greater than or equal to 2. Therefore, 3 is indeed less than or equal to the square root of `n`, and the loop will execute again.

The state of `is_prime` list does not affect the loop condition, so we don't need to adjust it.

However, we do need to adjust the state of `i` to reflect the next iteration. Since `i` is currently 2, the next value of `i` will be 3.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False` and the remaining elements are initially `True`**
