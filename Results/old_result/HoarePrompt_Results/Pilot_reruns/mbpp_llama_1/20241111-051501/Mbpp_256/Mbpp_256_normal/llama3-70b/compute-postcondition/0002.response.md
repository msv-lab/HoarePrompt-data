To ensure the loop executes, we need to consider the conditions that must be met. The loop iterates from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). Therefore, the following conditions must be satisfied:

1. `num` must be greater than or equal to 2, because if `num` is less than 2, the function returns False, and the loop will not execute.
2. `i` must be initialized to the starting value of the range, which is 2.
3. `num` must be a non-negative integer, which is already given in the initial state.

State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
