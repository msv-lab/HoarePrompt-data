The code `is_prime[j] = False` changes the value of the element at index `j` in the `is_prime` list to `False`. Since `j` is 20, the element at index 20 in the `is_prime` list is changed to `False`. The other variables are not affected. The value of `n` is still greater than 16, `i` is still 4, and `j` is still 20. The `is_prime` list has the same values as before, except for the element at index 20, which is now `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 16, `i` is 4, `j` is 20, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, elements at indices that are multiples of 3 from 9 to `n` are `False`, the element at index 16 is `False`, the element at index 20 is `False`, and the rest are `True`.**
