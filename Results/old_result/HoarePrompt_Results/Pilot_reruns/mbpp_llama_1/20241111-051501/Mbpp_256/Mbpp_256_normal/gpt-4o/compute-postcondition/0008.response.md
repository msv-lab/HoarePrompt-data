The value of `is_prime[j]` is set to `False`, and `j` has a value of 6. The list `is_prime` initially had its first five elements as `[False, False, True, True, False]` and the remaining elements were `True`. Since `j` is 6, the seventh element of the list is set to `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 6, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, the third and fourth elements are `True`, the fifth element is `False`, the sixth element is `True`, the seventh element is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `j` is 6.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 6, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is a list of `n` values where the first two elements are `False`, the third and fourth elements are `True`, the fifth element is `False`, the sixth element is `True`, the seventh element is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `j` is 6**
