The code `is_prime[j] = False` sets the value of `is_prime[j]` to `False`, where `j` is 12. The initial state of `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where `n` is greater than 9. Since `j` is 12, which is also greater than 9, the list `is_prime` has at least 12 elements.

After execution, the value of `is_prime[12]` is set to `False`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` are not affected.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 9, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values where `is_prime[9]` is `False` and `is_prime[12]` is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 12**
