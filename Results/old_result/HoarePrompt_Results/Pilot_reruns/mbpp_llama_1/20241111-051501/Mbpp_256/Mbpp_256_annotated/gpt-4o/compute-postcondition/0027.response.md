To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `range(i * i, n, i)`, which means the loop will iterate over the numbers from `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`.

Current state:
- `n` is greater than 3
- `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values where `is_prime[16]` is `False`
- `i` is 4

For the loop to execute again, the condition `i * i < n` must be true, since the loop iterates from `i * i` to `n`. 

Since `i` is 4, `i * i` is 16. We know that `is_prime[16]` is `False`, but this information is not relevant to the loop condition. However, we do know that `n` is greater than 3, but we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 16 for the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `n`, which should be greater than 16.

Additionally, since the loop iterates over `j` in `range(i * i, n, i)`, the next value of `j` would be `i * i`, which is 16. However, since the loop body is not provided, we cannot determine the exact value of `j` at the start of the next iteration. But we can infer that `j` would be at least 16.

The state of `is_prime` does not need to be adjusted, as it is not relevant to the loop condition.

State: **`n` is greater than 16, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values where `is_prime[16]` is `False`, `i` is 4**
