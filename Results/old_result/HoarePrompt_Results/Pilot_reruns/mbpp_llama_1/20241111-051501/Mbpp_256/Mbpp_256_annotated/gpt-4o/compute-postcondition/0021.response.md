To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the state of the variables at the end of the previous iteration.

The loop condition is `range(i * i, n, i)`, which means the loop will iterate over the values of `j` starting from `i * i` up to `n` with a step of `i`.

At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, and `n` is greater than 15. To execute the loop again, we need to find the next value of `j` that satisfies the loop condition.

Since `i` is 3, the next value of `j` would be `i * i + i = 3 * 3 + 3 = 12`. However, we already know that `is_prime[12]` is `False`. The loop will skip this value and move to the next one.

The next value of `j` would be `12 + 3 = 15`, but we already know that `is_prime[15]` is `False`. The loop will skip this value as well.

The next value of `j` would be `15 + 3 = 18`. Since `n` is greater than 15, it is possible that `n` is greater than or equal to 18, which would allow the loop to execute again.

Therefore, the state at the start of the next iteration should be adjusted as follows:

* `n` is still greater than 15 (no change)
* `is_prime` is still a list of `n` boolean values where `is_prime[9]` is `False`, `is_prime[12]` is `False`, and `is_prime[15]` is `False` (no change)
* `i` is still 3 (no change)
* `j` is now 18 (updated)

State: **`n` is greater than 15, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values where `is_prime[9]` is `False`, `is_prime[12]` is `False`, and `is_prime[15]` is `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 18**
