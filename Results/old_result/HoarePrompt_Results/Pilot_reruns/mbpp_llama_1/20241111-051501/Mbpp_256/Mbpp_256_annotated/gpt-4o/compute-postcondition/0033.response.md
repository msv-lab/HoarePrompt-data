Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, `i` is 4, `j` is the last multiple of 3 that is less than `n`. If `is_prime[i]` is `True`, then the `is_prime` list is updated such that all indices that are multiples of `i` in the range `[i * i, n)` are set to `False`, and `j` takes on the last multiple of `i` that is less than `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i * i`, the `is_prime` list remains unchanged. If `is_prime[i]` is `False`, then the `is_prime` list and the values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged.***
