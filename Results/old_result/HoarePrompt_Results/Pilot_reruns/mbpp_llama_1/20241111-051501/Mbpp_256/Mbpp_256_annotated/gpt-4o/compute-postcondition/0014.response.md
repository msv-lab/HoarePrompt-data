According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than the square root of `n` plus 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 3, `i` is not explicitly stated but we can infer that `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n` because it has completed the last iteration.

To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to the next integer, and `n` needs to be adjusted such that its square root plus 1 is greater than the new value of `i`. Since `n` is greater than 3, we can adjust it to be greater than the square of the new value of `i`.

Assuming the last iteration was at `i` equal to the square root of `n` (to maximize the value of `n`), the new value of `i` will be the next integer after the square root of `n`. For simplicity, let's assume the new value of `i` is 3 (since the square root of `n` must be greater than 2 but less than or equal to 3, given that `n` is greater than 3). Then `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than 3 squared, which is 9.

However, this adjustment is not necessary as the problem statement only asks for the state at the start of the next iteration, not the maximum possible value of `n`. Therefore, we only need to increment `i` to the next integer, and `n` remains greater than 3.

State: **`n` is greater than 3, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values. If `i` is a prime number (i.e., `is_prime[i]` is `True`), the `is_prime` list will have `False` values at indices that are multiples of `i`, and `True` values otherwise. If `i` is not a prime number (i.e., `is_prime[i]` is `False`), the `is_prime` list remains unchanged with the first two elements being `False` and the remaining elements being `True`, `i` is 3**
