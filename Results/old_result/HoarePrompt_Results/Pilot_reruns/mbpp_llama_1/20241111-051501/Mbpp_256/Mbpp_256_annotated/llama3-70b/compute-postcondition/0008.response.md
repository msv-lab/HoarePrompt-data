To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the loop condition.

The loop iterates over the range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3 and `num` is greater than 4.

For the loop to execute again, `i` must be less than the square root of `num` plus 1. Since `i` is currently 3, the next value of `i` would be 4. However, for `i` to be 4, the square root of `num` must be at least 4.

Therefore, the state of `num` needs to be adjusted to ensure that its square root is at least 4. This means `num` must be at least 16 (since âˆš16 = 4).

The state of `i` also needs to be adjusted to 4, as it is the next value in the iteration.

State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4**
