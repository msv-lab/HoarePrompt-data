To determine the output state of the loop, let's analyze its functionality and the variable values after its execution.

The loop iterates over a range of numbers from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive), checking if `num` is divisible by any of these numbers. If `num` is divisible by any of these numbers, the function immediately returns `False`.

Based on the provided output states after the loop executes a few times, we can infer the following:

- If `num` is less than 2, the function returns `False` without executing the loop.
- If `num` is 2 or 3, the loop does not execute because the range starts from 2, and `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` would be 2 or less, making the range empty.
- If `num` is 4 or greater, the loop executes, checking for divisibility by numbers up to the square root of `num`.

After the loop executes, the possible output states are:

- If `num` is divisible by any number in the range, the function returns `False`.
- If `num` is not divisible by any number in the range, the function does not return `False`, implying it may return a different value or continue executing.

Considering the loop's functionality and the variable values, the output state can be summarized as follows:

Output State: **If `num` is less than 2, the function returns `False`. If `num` is 2 or 3, the function does not execute the loop and returns a value other than `False` or continues executing. If `num` is 4 or greater, the function returns `False` if `num` is divisible by any number up to its square root; otherwise, it does not return `False` and may return a different value or continue executing. In all cases, `i` takes on the last value it was assigned in the loop, which is the square root of `num` if `num` is not a perfect square, or the largest factor of `num` less than or equal to its square root if `num` is a perfect square.**
