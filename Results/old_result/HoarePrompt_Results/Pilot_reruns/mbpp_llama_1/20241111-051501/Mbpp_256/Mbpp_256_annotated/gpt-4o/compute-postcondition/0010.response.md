The code `is_prime[j] = False` assigns `False` to the element at index `j` in the `is_prime` list. The value of `j` is 8. 

The `is_prime` list initially has `n` boolean values, where `n` is at least 8. The first two elements are `False`, the element at index 4 is `False`, the element at index 6 is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`.

After the execution of the code, the element at index 8 in the `is_prime` list is assigned `False`. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is at least 8, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False`, the element at index 4 is `False`, the element at index 6 is `False`, the element at index 8 is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 8.

Output State: **`n` is at least 8, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False`, the element at index 4 is `False`, the element at index 6 is `False`, the element at index 8 is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 8**
