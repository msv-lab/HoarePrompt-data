To determine the state at the start of the next iteration of the loop, let's analyze the loop statement and the given state.

The loop statement is `for j in range(i * i, n, i)`. This means the loop will execute as long as `j` is within the range from `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `n` is at least 8
- `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values with specific values set to `False` and the rest set to `True`
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 8

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the loop condition. Since `j` is currently 8, the next value of `j` should be within the range defined by `i * i` and `n`, with a step of `i`. Given `i` is 2, the next value of `j` should be `8 + 2 = 10`.

However, the loop's ability to execute again also depends on whether `n` is greater than or equal to the next potential value of `j`, which is 10. Since `n` is currently at least 8, it needs to be adjusted to be at least 10 to ensure the loop can execute again.

The state of `is_prime` and the value of `i` do not directly affect the loop's condition to execute again, given the loop statement. Thus, no adjustments are needed for `is_prime` or `i`.

State: **`n` is at least 10, `is_prime` is a list of `n` boolean values, where the first two elements are `False`, the element at index 4 is `False`, the element at index 6 is `False`, the element at index 8 is `False`, and the remaining elements are `True`, `i` is 2, `j` is 10**
