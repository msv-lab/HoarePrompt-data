The function returns `False`, and the values of `num` and `i` do not change. The return statement does not affect the state of the variables, so the output state is `num` is greater than 4, `i` is 3, and the function returns `False`.

Output State: **`num` is greater than 4, `i` is 3, and the function returns `False`**
