Postcondition: ***`num` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4. If `num` is divisible by `i`, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function does not return any value (i.e., it implicitly returns `None` or continues executing the next statements), and `num` and `i` retain their original values. This covers all edge cases, including when `num` is exactly 16 (which is divisible by `i`), and when `num` is greater than 16 and not divisible by `i`.***
