Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I will analyze the function's functionality.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` (a list) and `tpl` (a tuple). The function returns the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl` as a new list.

Looking at the code, the function uses the `+` operator to concatenate `lst` and `tpl`. However, since `tpl` is a tuple, it needs to be converted to a list using the `list()` function before concatenation.

The annotations suggest that the function returns a list that is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl`. However, there are no edge cases or potential errors mentioned. Let's consider some potential cases:

* If `lst` is an empty list, the function will return a list containing the elements of `tpl`.
* If `tpl` is an empty tuple, the function will return a list containing the elements of `lst`.
* If both `lst` and `tpl` are empty, the function will return an empty list.
* If `lst` or `tpl` contains non-hashable elements (e.g., lists or dictionaries), the function will still work correctly.
* If `lst` or `tpl` is `None`, the function will raise a `TypeError` when trying to concatenate.

Considering these cases, the functionality of the function can be summarized as follows:

Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and `tpl`. If either `lst` or `tpl` is empty, the function returns the non-empty list. If both are empty, the function returns an empty list. The function raises a `TypeError` if either `lst` or `tpl` is `None`. **
