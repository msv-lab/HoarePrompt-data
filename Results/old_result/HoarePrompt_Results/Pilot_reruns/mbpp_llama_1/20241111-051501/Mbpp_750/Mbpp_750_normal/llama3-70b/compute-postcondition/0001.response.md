The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tup`. `lst` is a list and `tup` is a tuple. After executing the function body, the function returns a list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the list version of `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and return a new list that combines the elements of `lst` and `tup`.

Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the list version of `tup`.**
