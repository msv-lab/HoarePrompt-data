Initial Assessment:
The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. It uses the `+` operator to concatenate the list and the tuple, which is a valid operation in Python. The `list()` function is used to convert the tuple to a list before concatenation. The code also handles the case where either the list or the tuple is empty, as the `+` operator will simply return the non-empty list.

However, I do notice that the code does not explicitly handle the case where either the list or the tuple is `None`. The problem description does not mention what should happen in this case, but the output hints suggest that a `TypeError` should be raised. This could be a potential edge case that the code is not handling.

Output Hints Analysis:
The output hints agree with the code and suggest that the function returns a new list that is the concatenation of the input list and tuple. The hints also mention that the function raises a `TypeError` if either the list or the tuple is `None`. However, the code does not explicitly handle this case.

Correctness: **False**

Explanation:
The code does not explicitly handle the case where either the list or the tuple is `None`, which could lead to a `TypeError` being raised. Although the output hints suggest that this is the expected behavior, the code does not explicitly implement this check. Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

For example, if the input is `func_1(None, (1, 2))`, the code will raise a `TypeError` because it tries to concatenate `None` with a list. However, the problem description does not specify what should happen in this case, and the code does not explicitly handle it. Therefore, the code is incorrect.
