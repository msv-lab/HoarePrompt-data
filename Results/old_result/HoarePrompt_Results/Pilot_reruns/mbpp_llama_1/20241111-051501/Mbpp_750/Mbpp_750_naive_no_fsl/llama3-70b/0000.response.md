Correctness: **True**

Explanation:

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tup` as input. The function returns a new list that is the result of concatenating the original list with the tuple converted to a list.

This program correctly meets the requirements of the problem description, which is to add the given tuple to the given list. The `+` operator is used to concatenate the two lists, and the `list()` function is used to convert the tuple to a list before concatenation.

I have considered various potential cases, including:

* Empty list and non-empty tuple
* Non-empty list and empty tuple
* List and tuple with different data types (e.g., integers, strings, etc.)
* List and tuple with duplicate elements

In all these cases, the program produces the expected result, which is a new list containing all elements from the original list and the tuple. Therefore, I conclude that the program is correct.
