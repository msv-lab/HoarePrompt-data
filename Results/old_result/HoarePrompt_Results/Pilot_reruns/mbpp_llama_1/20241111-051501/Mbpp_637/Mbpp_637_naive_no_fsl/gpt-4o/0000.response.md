Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program is correct because it accurately checks whether the given amount has no profit and no loss by comparing the cost price and selling price. If the cost price is equal to the selling price, it means there is no profit and no loss, and the function returns True. Otherwise, it returns False.

The provided unit tests also demonstrate the correctness of the function:

* `func_1(1500, 1200)` returns False because the selling price is less than the cost price, indicating a loss.
* `func_1(100, 100)` returns True because the selling price is equal to the cost price, indicating no profit and no loss.
* `func_1(2000, 5000)` returns False because the selling price is greater than the cost price, indicating a profit.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected, so I conclude that the program is correct.
