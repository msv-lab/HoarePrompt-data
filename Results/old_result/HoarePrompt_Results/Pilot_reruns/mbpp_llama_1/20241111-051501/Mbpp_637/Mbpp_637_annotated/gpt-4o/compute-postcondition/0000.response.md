The function returns the result of the comparison `cost_price == selling_price`. The values of `cost_price` and `selling_price` are numbers, but their specific values are unknown. The return statement does not change the state of the variables, so the output state is `cost_price` and `selling_price` are numbers, and the function returns a boolean value indicating whether `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`.

Output State: **`cost_price` and `selling_price` are numbers, and the function returns a boolean value indicating whether `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`.**
