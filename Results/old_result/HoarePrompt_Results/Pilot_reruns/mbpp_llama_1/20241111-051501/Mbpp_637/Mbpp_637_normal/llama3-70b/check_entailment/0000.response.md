Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1` checks whether the `cost_price` and `selling_price` are equal, which aligns with the problem description of checking whether the given amount has no profit and no loss.

However, I can think of an edge case where the code might not be handling correctly. What if the input values are not numbers? The problem description does not explicitly state what should happen in this case, but it is possible that the function should return an error or handle this case in a specific way.

Looking at the output hints, they agree with the code and also mention that if either `cost_price` or `selling_price` are not numbers, the function will still return `False`. This suggests that the code is indeed handling this edge case correctly.

Based on the code, the problem description, and the output hints, I believe that the code is correct.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly checks whether the `cost_price` and `selling_price` are equal, which aligns with the problem description. The code also handles the edge case where the input values are not numbers by returning `False`, which is consistent with the output hints.
