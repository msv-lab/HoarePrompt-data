Based on the code and the problem description, my initial assessment is that the code seems to be correct. The function `func_1` checks whether the given amount has no profit and no loss by comparing the `cost_price` and `selling_price`. If they are equal, it returns `True`, indicating no profit and no loss.

After reviewing the output hints, I see that they agree with the code. The function indeed returns a boolean value indicating whether the `cost_price` and `selling_price` are equal.

Upon further analysis, I couldn't find any edge cases that the code might not be handling. The function seems to work correctly for all possible inputs. The problem description also provides examples that the function handles correctly.

Therefore, I conclude that the code follows the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss by comparing the `cost_price` and `selling_price`. The function returns `True` if they are equal, indicating no profit and no loss, and `False` otherwise. The output hints agree with the code, and I couldn't find any edge cases that the code might not be handling.
