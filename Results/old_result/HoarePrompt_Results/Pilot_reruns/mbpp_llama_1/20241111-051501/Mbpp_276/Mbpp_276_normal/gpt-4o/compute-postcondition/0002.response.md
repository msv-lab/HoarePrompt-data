The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. After executing the function body, the function returns a non-negative real number, `volume`, which is calculated as π times the square of `radius` times `height`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative real numbers `radius` and `height`, and return the calculated volume.

Functionality: **The function accepts non-negative real numbers `radius` and `height`, and returns the calculated volume as π times the square of `radius` times `height`.**
