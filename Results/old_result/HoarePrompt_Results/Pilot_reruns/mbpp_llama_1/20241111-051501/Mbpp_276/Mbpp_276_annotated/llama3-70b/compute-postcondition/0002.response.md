Let's analyze the code step by step.

The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, and returns the result of the expression `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`.

The annotations state that `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers, and the function returns the volume of a cylinder with the given radius and height.

However, upon closer inspection, we notice that the code does not explicitly check if `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. Therefore, the function may return incorrect results or raise errors if these conditions are not met.

Additionally, the code does not handle potential edge cases, such as `radius` or `height` being zero, or `radius` being negative.

Considering these factors, we can conclude that the functionality of the function is:

Functionality: ** The function accepts two real number parameters `radius` and `height`, calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, and returns the result. However, the function does not validate the input values, and may return incorrect results or raise errors if `radius` or `height` are not non-negative real numbers. **
