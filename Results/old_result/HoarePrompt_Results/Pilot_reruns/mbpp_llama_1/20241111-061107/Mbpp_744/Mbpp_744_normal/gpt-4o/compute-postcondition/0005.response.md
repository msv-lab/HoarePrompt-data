Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 items, and `item` is the second item in the tuple. If `item` is None, the function returns True. Otherwise, the function does not explicitly return a value, implying that it may return a default value or continue executing other parts of the code, maintaining the state of `tup` and `item` unchanged.***
