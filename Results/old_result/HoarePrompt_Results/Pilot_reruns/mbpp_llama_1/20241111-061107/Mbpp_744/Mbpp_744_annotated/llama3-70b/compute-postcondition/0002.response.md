Based on the annotated code and return postconditions, I understand that the function `func_1` accepts a tuple `tup` as input and returns a boolean value.

The code uses the `any` function with a generator expression to check if any element in the tuple is `None`. If at least one element is `None`, the function returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`.

The annotations and return postconditions suggest that the function behaves as expected for tuples containing `None` values. However, I also consider the following edge cases:

* If the input tuple is empty, the function will return `False`, since there are no elements to check.
* If the input tuple contains only non-`None` values, the function will return `False`.
* If the input tuple contains a mix of `None` and non-`None` values, the function will return `True` as soon as it encounters the first `None` value.

Based on this analysis, I conclude that the functionality of the function is to check if any element in the input tuple is `None` and return `True` if so, or `False` otherwise.

Functionality: ** The function accepts a tuple as input and returns True if any element in the tuple is None, False otherwise, including cases where the tuple is empty or contains only non-None values. **
