Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element, `item` is the first element in the tuple. If `item` is `None`, the function returns `True`. Otherwise, the function does not return a value explicitly, implying that it may continue executing or return a value based on subsequent code not shown in this fragment.***
