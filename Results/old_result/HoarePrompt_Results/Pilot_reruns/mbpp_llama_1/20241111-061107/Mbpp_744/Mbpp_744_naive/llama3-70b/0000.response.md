Correctness: **True**

Explanation:
The given function `func_1` checks if any element in the tuple `tup` is `None`. The `any` function returns `True` as soon as it encounters an element that satisfies the condition, which in this case is `x is None`. This means that the function will return `True` as soon as it finds a `None` value in the tuple, and `False` otherwise.

I couldn't find any potential case where the program does not work as expected. The function correctly handles tuples of any size, including empty tuples, and correctly identifies tuples with and without `None` values. For example:

* `func_1((1, 2, 3))` returns `False`
* `func_1((1, None, 3))` returns `True`
* `func_1(())` returns `False`

The function also correctly handles tuples with multiple `None` values, and tuples with `None` as the only element.

Overall, the program seems to be correct and works as expected for all potential cases.
