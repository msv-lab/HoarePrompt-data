Let's analyze the code step by step:

The code `first_char = s[0]` assigns the first character of the string `s` to the variable `first_char`. 

If `s` is empty, this will raise an `IndexError` because there is no first character to assign. However, the problem statement suggests that if `s` is empty, the function returns `True`, which means this line of code is not executed in that case.

If `s` is not empty, `first_char` is assigned the first character of `s`. The state of `s` itself is not changed.

Output State: **`s` is a string, `first_char` is the first character of `s` if `s` is not empty**
