To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop statement and the given state.

The loop statement is `for char in s:`, which means the loop will iterate over each character in the string `s`.

The given state is:
* `s` is a non-empty string
* `first_char` is the first character of `s`
* `char` is the first character of `s`
* If `char` is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function does not return `False`, implying that `char` is equal to `first_char`.

Since the loop has not terminated, we know that `s` still has at least one character left to iterate over. Therefore, we need to adjust the state of `char` to be the next character in the string `s`.

The state of `first_char` remains the same, as it is the first character of the original string `s`.

The state of `s` can be adjusted to reflect that it has at least one fewer character than before, but we don't need to specify the exact length.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string with at least one fewer character than before, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character of `s`**
