Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string with at least one fewer character than before, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the second character of `s`. If `char` is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns False; otherwise, the function continues execution without returning a value, maintaining the original state of `s`, `first_char`, and `char`.***
