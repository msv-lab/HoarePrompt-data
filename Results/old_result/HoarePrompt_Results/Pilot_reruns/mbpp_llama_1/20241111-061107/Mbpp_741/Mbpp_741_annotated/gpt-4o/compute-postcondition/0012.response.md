To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, let's analyze the given information and the loop statement.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `s` is not empty with at least one character removed from the beginning.
- `first_char` is the first character of the original `s`.
- `char` is the first character of the current `s` (which is the third character of the original `s`).

Loop statement:
```
for char in s:
    # the loop body is omit
```

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must not be empty since the loop iterates over the characters in `s`. Given that `char` is the first character of the current `s` and is the third character of the original `s`, for the loop to continue, `s` must have at least one more character after `char`. This implies that the current `char` should be the next character in the sequence of the original `s`, which means it moves one position forward.

Therefore, the adjustments needed for the state at the start of the next iteration are:
- `s` must still not be empty but with at least one more character removed from the beginning.
- `first_char` remains the same as it is the first character of the original `s`.
- `char` should be the next character in `s`, which is the fourth character of the original `s`.

State: **`s` is not empty with at least two characters removed from the beginning, `first_char` is the first character of the original `s`, `char` is the fourth character of the original `s`.**
