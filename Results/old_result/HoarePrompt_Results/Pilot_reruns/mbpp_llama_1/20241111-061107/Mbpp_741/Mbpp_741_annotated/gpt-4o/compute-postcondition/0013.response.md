Output State: **The loop checks if all characters in the string `s` are equal to the first character `first_char`. If `s` is empty, the function returns `True`. If `s` is not empty, the loop iterates over each character in `s`. If any character is not equal to `first_char`, the function immediately returns `False`. If the loop completes without finding any mismatched characters, the function's return value is not specified in the given code snippet, but based on the loop's functionality, it can be inferred that the function would return `True` if all characters match. Therefore, the output state is that the function returns `True` if all characters in `s` are equal to `first_char` or if `s` is empty, and `False` otherwise.**
