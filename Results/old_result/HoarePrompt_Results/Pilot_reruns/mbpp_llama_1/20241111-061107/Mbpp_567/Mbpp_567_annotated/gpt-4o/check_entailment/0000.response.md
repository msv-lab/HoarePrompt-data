Correctness: **True**

I have analyzed the provided code and annotations, and I believe that the code correctly implements the problem description. The function `func_1` checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order.

The annotations provide a clear explanation of the code's behavior, which matches the problem description. The annotations mention that the function returns `True` for empty or single-element lists, which is correct. The code also correctly returns `False` as soon as it finds a pair of elements that are out of order.

I have not found any potential cases where the code does not follow the problem description. The code correctly handles the edge cases mentioned in the annotations, such as empty or single-element lists.

The annotations influenced my reasoning by providing a clear explanation of the code's behavior and highlighting the edge cases that the code handles. However, I have double-checked the annotations to ensure that they agree with the code and the problem description.

Overall, I believe that the code correctly implements the problem description, and I have not found any cases where the code does not work as expected.
