To determine the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, let's analyze the given information and the loop condition.

Given state at the end of the previous iteration:
- `lst` is a list with at least 2 elements.
- `i` is 1.
- If the second element of `lst` is greater than the third element, the function returns `False`. Otherwise, the function does not return `False` when the second element of `lst` is less than or equal to the third element.

Loop condition: `for i in range(len(lst) - 1)`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(lst) - 1`. Currently, `i` is 1, and since `lst` has at least 2 elements, `len(lst) - 1` is at least 1. However, for the loop to continue, `len(lst) - 1` must be greater than 1, meaning `len(lst)` must be at least 3. 

Thus, the state of `lst` needs to be adjusted to reflect that it has at least 3 elements for the loop to execute again. Additionally, since `i` is 1 at the end of the previous iteration, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 2.

State: **`lst` is a list with at least 3 elements, `i` is 2**.
