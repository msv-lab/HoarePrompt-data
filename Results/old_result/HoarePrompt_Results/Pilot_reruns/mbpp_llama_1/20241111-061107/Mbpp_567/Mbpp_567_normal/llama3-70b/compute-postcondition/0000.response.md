The function returns the result of the `all` function, which checks if all elements in the list `lst` are in non-decreasing order. The `all` function uses a generator expression to iterate over the indices of the list, comparing each element with the next one. The `range(len(lst) - 1)` ensures that the last element is not compared with an out-of-bounds index.

The state of the variable `lst` does not change, but the function returns a boolean value indicating whether the list is in non-decreasing order.

Output State: **`lst` is a list, and the function returns True if the list is in non-decreasing order, False otherwise**
