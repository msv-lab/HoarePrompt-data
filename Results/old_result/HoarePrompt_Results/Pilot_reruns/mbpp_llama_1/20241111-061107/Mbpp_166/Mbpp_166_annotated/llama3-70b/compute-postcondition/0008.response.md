To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to analyze the loop condition and the current state.

The loop condition is `range(i + 1, len(nums))`, which means the loop will execute as long as `j` is greater than or equal to `i + 1` and less than the length of `nums`.

Currently, `i` is 0 and `j` is 2. For the loop to execute again, `j` needs to be incremented to the next value in the range.

Since `nums` has at least 3 elements, the next value of `j` would be 3, which is still within the range of `nums`. Therefore, the state of `j` needs to be updated to 3.

The state of `i` remains the same, as it is not updated in the loop condition.

The state of `nums` also remains the same, as it is not modified in the loop condition.

The state of `count` is dependent on the difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]`, but since `i` and `j` are updated, the condition for `count` is no longer applicable. However, we can infer that if the loop executes again, the difference between `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` will be different, so the state of `count` should be updated to a single value, either 1 or 2, without any condition.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 3 elements, `i` is 0, `j` is 3, `count` is 1**
