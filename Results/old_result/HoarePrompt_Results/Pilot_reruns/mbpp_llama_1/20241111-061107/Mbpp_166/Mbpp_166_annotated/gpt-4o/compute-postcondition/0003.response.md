`odd_pairs` is assigned the value `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`, which is the number of ways to choose 2 odd integers from `lst`. The values of `lst`, `even_count`, and `even_pairs` are not affected. The value of `odd_count` is also not changed, only used for the calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the number of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the number of odd integers in `lst`, `even_pairs` is the number of ways to choose 2 even integers from `lst`, and `odd_pairs` is the number of ways to choose 2 odd integers from `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the number of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the number of odd integers in `lst`, `even_pairs` is the number of ways to choose 2 even integers from `lst`, and `odd_pairs` is the number of ways to choose 2 odd integers from `lst`.**
