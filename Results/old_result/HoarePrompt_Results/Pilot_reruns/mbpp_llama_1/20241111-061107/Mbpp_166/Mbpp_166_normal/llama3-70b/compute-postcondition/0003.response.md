The value of `count` is incremented by 1, and `count` is initially 0, so after execution, `count` is 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1.

Output State: **`nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `count` is 1, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
