`odd_pairs` is assigned the value `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`, which is the number of pairs of odd numbers that can be formed from `lst`. The value of `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in `lst`. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in `lst`, `even_pairs` is the number of pairs of even numbers that can be formed from `lst`, and `odd_pairs` is the number of pairs of odd numbers that can be formed from `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in `lst`, `even_pairs` is the number of pairs of even numbers that can be formed from `lst`, and `odd_pairs` is the number of pairs of odd numbers that can be formed from `lst`.**
