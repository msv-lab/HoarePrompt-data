To ensure the loop can execute, we need to consider the variables involved in the loop statement. The loop statement is `for j in range(i + 1, len(nums)):`. This means we need to focus on the values of `i` and `len(nums)`.

Given that `i` is 1 and `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, for the loop to execute, `len(nums)` must be at least 2 to ensure that `i + 1` (which is 2) is less than `len(nums)`. Since `count` is related to the properties of the elements in `nums` but does not directly affect the loop's execution condition, we don't need to adjust its state for the loop to start. However, `j` needs to be initialized to the first value it will take in the loop, which is `i + 1`, hence `j` is 2.

State: **`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` where the sum of the bitwise XOR of the first element and the other elements is even, `i` is 1, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements, `j` is 2**
