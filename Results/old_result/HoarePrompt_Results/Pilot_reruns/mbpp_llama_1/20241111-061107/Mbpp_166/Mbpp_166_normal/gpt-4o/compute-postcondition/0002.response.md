`even_pairs` is assigned the value `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`, which is the number of pairs of even numbers that can be formed from `lst`. The values of `lst`, `even_count`, and `odd_count` are not changed. Therefore, the output state is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in `lst`, and `even_pairs` is the number of pairs of even numbers that can be formed from `lst`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in `lst`, and `even_pairs` is the number of pairs of even numbers that can be formed from `lst`.**
