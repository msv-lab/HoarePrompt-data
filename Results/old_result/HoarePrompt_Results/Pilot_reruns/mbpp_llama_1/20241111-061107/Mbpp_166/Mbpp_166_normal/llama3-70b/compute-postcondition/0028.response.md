Postcondition: ***`nums` has at least 3 elements, `count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` where the sum of the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and the other elements is even, `i` is 2, `j` is 3. If the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged.***
