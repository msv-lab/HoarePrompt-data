According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `i` and the length of `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 1, and `nums` needs to have at least 2 elements.

State: **`count` is the number of pairs of elements in `nums` where the sum of the bitwise XOR of the first element and the other elements is even, `i` is 1, `nums` is a non-empty list of integers with at least 2 elements**
