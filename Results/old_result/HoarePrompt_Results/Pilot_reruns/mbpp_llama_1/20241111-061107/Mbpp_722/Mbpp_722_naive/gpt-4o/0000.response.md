Correctness: **True**

The provided Python function `func_1` correctly filters students that have height and weight above the minimum. The function uses a dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary that only includes students who meet the minimum height and weight requirements.

The function iterates over each item in the input dictionary `student_dict`, where each item is a key-value pair containing the student's name and a tuple of their height and weight. The function then checks if the student's height and weight are greater than or equal to the minimum height and weight, respectively. If both conditions are met, the student's information is included in the new dictionary.

The provided unit tests demonstrate the function's correctness by testing it with different input values and verifying that the output matches the expected result. The function's logic is sound, and it correctly handles all possible cases, including students with heights and weights that are exactly equal to the minimum values.

Overall, the function is well-structured, readable, and correctly implements the required functionality.
