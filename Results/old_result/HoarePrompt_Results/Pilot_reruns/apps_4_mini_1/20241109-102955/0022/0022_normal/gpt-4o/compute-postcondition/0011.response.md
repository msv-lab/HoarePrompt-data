Output State: **If `n` is even, the loop will execute `n // 2` times, checking pairs of characters from the start and end of `s`. If all pairs are equal, the function continues execution; if any pair is not equal, the function returns False. If `n` is odd, the loop will execute `n // 2` times as well, and the middle character will not be checked, allowing the function to continue execution. If `n` is less than 2, the loop will not execute and the function continues execution without returning. In all cases, `s` remains a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, and `i` is the current index being checked, taking values from 0 to `n // 2 - 1`.**
