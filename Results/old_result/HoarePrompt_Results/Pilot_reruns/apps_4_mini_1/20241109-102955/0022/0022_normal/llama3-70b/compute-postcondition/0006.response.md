Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, and `i` is 0. If the first character of `s` does not match the last character of `s`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the execution breaks out of the loop or if statement. If the characters match, `is_spalindrome` remains True, indicating that the string could still be a palindrome, pending further checks.***
