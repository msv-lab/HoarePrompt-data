The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `False`, which means it is updated from its previous value of `True`. The values of the other variables (`s`, `n`, and `i`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 0, and `is_spalindrome` is False.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, `i` is 0, and `is_spalindrome` is False**
