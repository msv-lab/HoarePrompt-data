Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, and `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters are equal, the state of `is_spalindrome` remains unchanged, and the program continues executing. This handles the situation where `s` has a length less than or equal to 4, as the comparison will not be valid for those cases.***
