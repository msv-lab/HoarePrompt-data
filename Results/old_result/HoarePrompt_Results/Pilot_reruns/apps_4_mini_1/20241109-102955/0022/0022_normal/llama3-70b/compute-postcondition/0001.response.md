The length of the string `s` is calculated using `len(s)`, and this value is assigned to `n`. The initial state indicates that `s` is a string consisting of only English letters, so it has a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive. Therefore, `n` will be a positive integer representing the length of `s`. The output state reflects this change while keeping the initial state intact.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of only English letters with a length between 1 and 1000 inclusive; `n` is the length of `s`**
