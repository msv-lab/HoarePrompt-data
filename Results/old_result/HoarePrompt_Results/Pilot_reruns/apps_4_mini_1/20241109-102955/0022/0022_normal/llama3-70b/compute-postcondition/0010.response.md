Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of only English letters, `n` is the length of `s`, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `n - i - 1`, then `is_palindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the characters match, the program continues without modifying `is_palindrome`.***
