According to the code, the loop executes as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been updated to `i + 1`, and `n` is greater than `2 * (current value of i + 1)`. Thus, `n` must be adjusted to ensure that it is still greater than `2 * (i + 1)` for the loop to execute one more time.

Since `i` has been updated to `i + 1`, for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be adjusted back to its previous value, and `n` should be greater than `2 * (i)`, which means we should have `n` greater than `2 * (i + 1 - 1)` or `n` greater than `2 * i`.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- `i` should be updated back to its previous value (i.e., `i` is `i` before the last increment).
- `n` should be adjusted to be greater than `2 * i`.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of English letters, `n` is greater than `2 * i`, `is_palindrome` remains the same, and `i` is `i`**.
