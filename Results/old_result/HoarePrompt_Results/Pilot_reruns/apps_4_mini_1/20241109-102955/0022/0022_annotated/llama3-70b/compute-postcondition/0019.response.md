Functionality: ** The function accepts a string input `s`, which consists of English letters and has a length between 1 and 1000 characters. It checks if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) and prints 'TAK' if it is a palindrome or 'NIE' if it is not. The function does not handle any invalid inputs or check for any characters beyond English letters, as it assumes the input is valid based on the annotations. **
