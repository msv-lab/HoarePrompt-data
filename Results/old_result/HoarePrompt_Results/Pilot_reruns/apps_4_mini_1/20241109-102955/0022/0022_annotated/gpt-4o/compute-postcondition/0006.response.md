Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is the length of `s`, and `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` of `s` does not match the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. This implies that for the specific case where `i` is 1, the second character of `s` must equal the second last character of `s` for the function not to return False.***
