To determine the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's analyze both the code and the annotations step by step.

### Problem Description Summary
1. The program takes three integers: `x` (upvotes), `y` (downvotes), and `z` (unknown votes).
2. The output should be:
   - "+" if upvotes are strictly greater than downvotes (considering unknown votes).
   - "-" if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes (considering unknown votes).
   - "0" if upvotes equal downvotes exactly (no unknown votes).
   - "?" if there's uncertainty due to unknown votes.

### Code Analysis
1. **If Statement:**
   ```python
   if (x > y + z):
       print('+')
   ```
   - This checks if the `x` (upvotes) is greater than the total of `y` (downvotes) and `z` (unknown votes). This correctly identifies when upvotes are definitively higher.

2. **Else Statement:**
   ```python
   if (x < y):
       print('-')
   ```
   - This checks if downvotes are strictly greater than upvotes, which is also correct.

3. **Equal Case:**
   ```python
   else:
       if (x == y):
           if (z == 0):
               print('0')
           else:
               print('?')
   ```
   - This handles the case where upvotes are equal to downvotes. It checks for `z`:
     - If `z` is 0, it prints "0".
     - If `z` is greater than 0, it prints "?", indicating uncertainty.

4. **Final Else:**
   ```python
   else:
       print('?')
   ```
   - This covers cases where the upvotes are greater than downvotes but not definitively (due to `z`).

### Edge Cases
To ensure the program is correct, let's consider the examples given in the problem statement and the cases covered by the code:

- **Example 1:** Input `3 7 0` → Output `-` (correct).
- **Example 2:** Input `2 0 1` → Output `+` (correct).
- **Example 3:** Input `1 1 0` → Output `0` (correct).
- **Example 4:** Input `0 0 1` → Output `?` (correct).

### Annotations Review
The annotations confirm that the code handles various scenarios correctly:
- They describe the behavior of the program in terms of states and expected outputs.
- They indicate that the program will correctly report uncertainty when `z > 0` and upvotes equal downvotes, which aligns with the problem description.

### Conclusion
After thorough analysis, the code correctly implements the logic required by the problem description for all specified input cases. There are no potential cases in the problem description that the code does not handle accurately.

**Correctness: True** 

The program correctly determines the output based on the provided logic, adhering fully to the specifications of the problem description.
