The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. The value of `y` is taken from input, and its specific value is within the range of 0 to 100. The previous values of the other variables remain unchanged. Thus, the output state reflects the assignment and the unchanged values of the other variables. 

Output State: **`x` is an input integer, `y` is an input integer, `z` is an input integer, `min_upvotes` is `x`, `max_upvotes` is `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is `y`**
