The code assigns the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on the input provided, which is split into three integers. The previous states of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not provided, but they are within the range of 0 to 100. Therefore, after the execution of the code, `x`, `y`, and `z` will be updated to the values provided by the input.

Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are updated to the input integers, where 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100**
