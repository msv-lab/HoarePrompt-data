To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic in the program.

The problem states that we need to determine the voting outcome based on the number of upvotes (x), downvotes (y), and unknown votes (z). The results can be:
- "+" if upvotes are definitively greater than downvotes
- "-" if downvotes are definitively greater than upvotes
- "0" if upvotes equal downvotes
- "?" if the outcome is uncertain due to the presence of unknown votes

Let's examine the program:

```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
if x > y + z:
    print('+')
elif x < y:
    print('-')
elif x == y:
    if z == 0:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('?')
else:
    print('?')
```

### Analysis
1. **Case 1**: When `x > y + z`
   - This condition checks if the known upvotes are greater than all possible downvotes (the known downvotes plus all unknowns assuming they all downvote). If true, it correctly prints "+".

2. **Case 2**: When `x < y`
   - This checks if the known downvotes are greater than the known upvotes. If true, it correctly prints "-".

3. **Case 3**: When `x == y`
   - Here, if `z == 0`, it correctly prints "0" since there are no unknown votes to influence the outcome.
   - If `z > 0`, it prints "?" since the outcome could change based on the unknown votes.

4. **Case 4**: The final else clause covers when `x < y + z` but not equal to `y`, leading to uncertainty.

### Potential Cases
- **Example Case**: `x = 0, y = 0, z = 1`
   - The program would evaluate this as `x == y` and `z > 0`, thus it would print "?". This is correct since the outcome can either be "+" (if the unknown votes are upvotes) or "-" (if they are downvotes).

- **Example Case**: `x = 3, y = 3, z = 1`
   - The program would check `x == y` and since `z > 0`, it would print "?". This is also correct since the outcome can be "+" or "-" depending on the unknown vote.

- **Example Case**: `x = 0, y = 1, z = 1`
   - The program would evaluate it as `x < y` and would print "-". This is correct because it is definitive that there are more downvotes.

### Conclusion
The program handles all outlined scenarios correctly. The checks for the various cases take into account the possible influences of the unknown votes and correctly categorize the outcomes as specified in the problem description.

Thus, there are no cases where the program fails to meet the requirements.

Correctness: **True**.
