The variable `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`. Since both `x` and `z` are non-negative integers within the range 0 to 100, the resulting value of `max_upvotes` will also be a non-negative integer. Other variables (`min_upvotes`, `y`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State reflects the initial conditions and the new value for `max_upvotes`.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is also a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `y` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `z` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`.**
