The code executes a print statement that outputs a hyphen ('-'). This action does not affect the values of any variables in the current state. Therefore, the output state remains the same as the initial state with the addition that a hyphen has been printed.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `y` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `z` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`; `min_downvotes` is `y`; `max_downvotes` is `y + z`, and a hyphen ('-') has been printed.**
