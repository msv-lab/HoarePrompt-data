To assess the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the program and the output hints step by step.

### Problem Description Summary:
1. There are three types of votes: 
   - `x` upvotes
   - `y` downvotes
   - `z` unknown votes (which can be either up or down)
2. The possible results are:
   - "+" if upvotes are definitively more than downvotes.
   - "-" if downvotes are definitively more than upvotes.
   - "0" if upvotes equal downvotes definitively.
   - "?" if the result is uncertain due to the unknown votes.

### Program Logic:
```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
if x > y + z:  # Case A
    print('+')
elif x < y:  # Case B
    print('-')
elif x == y:
    if z == 0:  # Case C
        print('0')
    else:  # Case D
        print('?')
else:  # Case E
    print('?')
```

### Analysis of Each Case:
- **Case A (x > y + z)**: This checks if the upvotes are greater than what the downvotes can possibly be (i.e., all unknown votes could potentially be downvotes). This correctly results in "+".
  
- **Case B (x < y)**: This checks if the downvotes are definitively greater than upvotes. This correctly results in "-".
  
- **Case C (x == y)**: 
  - If `z == 0`, it means there are no unknown votes, and the result is definitively "0".
  
- **Case D (x == y and z > 0)**: In this case, since there are unknown votes, the result can vary, leading to uncertainty, hence the output is "?".
  
- **Case E (This is the catch-all)**: This case is invoked when the previous conditions do not apply. It accounts for situations where upvotes are greater than downvotes but not definitively better, leading to uncertainty, hence "?" is printed.

### Output Hints Review:
The output hints state:
1. It prints '+' if `x` is greater than `y + z`.
2. It prints '-' if `x` is less than `y`.
3. It prints '0' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0.
4. It prints '?' if `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than 0, or if the situation doesn't allow for a definitive outcome.

### Edge Cases:
Let's consider some edge cases:
1. **Input: 0 0 0** - Expected output: "0" (correctly handled).
2. **Input: 0 0 1** - Expected output: "?" (correctly handled).
3. **Input: 100 100 100** - Expected output: "?" (correctly handled).
4. **Input: 50 50 0** - Expected output: "0" (correctly handled).
5. **Input: 100 50 0** - Expected output: "+" (correctly handled).

After careful examination of the program and the provided hints, the program seems to cover all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement. Each condition is addressed correctly according to the requirements.

### Conclusion:
The program accurately implements the logic outlined in the problem description for every potential case.

Correctness: **True**.
