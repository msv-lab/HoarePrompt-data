The code snippet `print('?')` outputs a question mark, but does not affect the values of any variables. Therefore, the output state remains unchanged with respect to the variable values.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `y` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `z` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`; `min_downvotes` is `y`; `max_downvotes` is `y + z**
