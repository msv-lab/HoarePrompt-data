Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers within the range 0 to 100. `max_upvotes`, which is the sum of `x` and `z`, is less than `min_downvotes`, resulting in a hyphen ('-') being printed. If `max_downvotes`, calculated as `y + z`, is less than `min_upvotes`, a plus sign ('+') is printed. In cases where `max_downvotes` is equal to or greater than `min_upvotes`, a question mark ('?') is printed. This covers all scenarios where the relationships between `max_upvotes`, `min_downvotes`, and `max_downvotes` in relation to `min_upvotes` are evaluated.***
