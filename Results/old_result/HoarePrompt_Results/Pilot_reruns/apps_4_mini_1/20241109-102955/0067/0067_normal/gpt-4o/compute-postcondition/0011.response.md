Functionality: ** The function accepts three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from user input, which are constrained to the range 0 to 100. It calculates minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes. The function prints a hyphen ('-') if the maximum upvotes (`x + z`) are less than the minimum downvotes (`y`), a plus sign ('+') if the maximum downvotes (`y + z`) are less than the minimum upvotes (`x`), and a question mark ('?') if neither condition is met. This includes handling the case when maximum downvotes equal minimum upvotes. **
