Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers such that 0 <= `x`, `y`, `z` <= 100. If `x` is greater than `y + z`, a plus sign is printed. If `x` is less than `y`, a minus sign is printed. If `x` equals `y` and `z` is 0, '0' is printed. If `x` equals `y` and `z` is greater than 0, a question mark is printed. If `x` is greater than `y` but not greater than `y + z`, a question mark is printed.***
