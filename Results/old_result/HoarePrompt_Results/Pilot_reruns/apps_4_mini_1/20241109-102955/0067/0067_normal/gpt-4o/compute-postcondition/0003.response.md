The variable `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`. Since `y` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100, `min_downvotes` will also take on that value. The other variables (`x`, `min_upvotes`, `z`, and `max_upvotes`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the values of the affected variable and the unchanged variables.

Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `y` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `z` is a non-negative integer from input within the range 0 to 100; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`; `min_downvotes` is `y`.**
