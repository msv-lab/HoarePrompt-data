To determine the correctness of the given Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the logic of the program and consider potential edge cases.

The program aims to determine the voting result based on the number of upvotes (`x`), downvotes (`y`), and unknown votes (`z`). The expected outputs are:
- "+" if upvotes are guaranteed to be greater than downvotes,
- "-" if downvotes are guaranteed to be greater than upvotes,
- "0" if upvotes equal downvotes,
- "?" if the result could vary based on the unknown votes.

The code provided is as follows:
```python
(x, y, z) = map(int, input().split())
if x > y + z:
    print('+')
elif x < y:
    print('-')
elif x == y:
    if z == 0:
        print('0')
    else:
        print('?')
else:
    print('?')
```

### Analyzing the logic:
1. **Case 1**: If `x > y + z`, the result is definitely "+" since even in the worst case (all `z` are downvotes), `x` will still be greater than `y`.
2. **Case 2**: If `x < y`, the result is definitely "-" since even if all `z` are upvotes, `y` will still be greater than `x`.
3. **Case 3**: If `x == y`, we check `z`. If `z` is 0, it means we have an equal number of upvotes and downvotes, thus the result is "0". If `z > 0`, there are potential scenarios where the result can be "+" or "-", hence the result is "?".
4. **Case 4**: The final `else` handles the case where `x < y + z` but `x` is not equal to `y`, which means there's uncertainty in the potential results.

### Potential Edge Cases:
1. **Input**: `0 0 1` should output "?" (since the result can be "+" or "-").
2. **Input**: `1 1 0` should output "0" (since the votes are equal).
3. **Input**: `3 7 0` should output "-" (since downvotes are greater).
4. **Input**: `2 0 1` should output "+" (since upvotes can exceed downvotes irrespective of the unknown).

### Edge Case Analysis:
- For the input `0 0 1`, the program outputs "?" which is correct as there is uncertainty.
- For the input `1 1 0`, the output is "0", which is correct.
- For the input `3 7 0`, the output is "-", which is correct.
- For the input `2 0 1`, the output is "+", which is correct.

### Conclusion:
After analyzing various scenarios and edge cases based on the provided program logic, the program correctly implements the requirements stated in the problem description. There are no cases where the program provides the incorrect output for valid inputs as described.

Correctness: **True**
