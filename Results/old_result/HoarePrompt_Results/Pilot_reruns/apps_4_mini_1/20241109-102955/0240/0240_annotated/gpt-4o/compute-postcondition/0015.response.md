Functionality: ** The function accepts a string `chars` composed of digits and a non-empty string `sub` of digits. It generates and yields all valid permutations of `chars` that satisfy the validity check performed by the `is_valid_number` function against `sub`. The function does not return a list of possible numbers; instead, it yields each valid candidate one at a time, which means that it can handle very large input sizes efficiently without generating a complete list in memory. If `chars` is empty, the function yields nothing. Additionally, if `sub` contains only leading zeroes or is not a valid number, this does not prevent the generation of permutations but may affect the yielded candidates' validity.**
