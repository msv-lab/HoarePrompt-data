According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` has more characters, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of digits, `t_set` is a set of characters from `t`, `n` is an empty string, and `c` is the first character of `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `s` must have at least one more character after the current character `c`. If `c` is the first character, then for the next iteration, `c` will be the second character of `s`.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `c` has changed to the next character in `s`, while `n` can remain as it is (either updated to the character or still empty, depending on whether the new character is in `t_set`).

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of digits, `t_set` is a set of characters from `t`, `n` is the current value of `n`, and `c` is the second character of `s`**
