According to the code, the loop iterates over all permutations of the string `chars`. The loop will execute again if there are additional permutations available. At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`. If `chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, there are more permutations to consider. 

To adjust for the next iteration:
1. The next permutation would need to be computed, so `perm` should be updated to the second permutation of `chars`.
2. Since `candidate` is derived from `perm` and is the first permutation at the end of the last iteration, it too needs to be adjusted to reflect the next permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the second permutation of `chars` as a string.**
