The code assigns `candidate` the value of `''.join(perm)`, which concatenates the characters in `perm` into a single string. Since `perm` is defined as the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will now hold the string representation of this third permutation. The state of `chars` and `perm` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string representation of the third permutation of `chars`.

Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string representation of the third permutation of `chars`**.
