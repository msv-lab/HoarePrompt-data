The function accepts a string `s` containing digits and a non-empty substring `t` of digits. It constructs a new string by concatenating all characters from `s` that are also in `t` followed by `t`. The function then returns the integer representation of this concatenated string. If `s` contains no characters found in `t`, the result will only be the integer value of `t`.
