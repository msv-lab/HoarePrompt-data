The function returns `int(n)`, where `n` is a string containing characters from `s` found in `t_set` plus `t`. The value of `n` is not explicitly provided, but since it is a string, it can represent a valid integer or not. The return statement converts `n` to an integer. The output state will include `n` as a string and the returned integer value. 

Since we don't know the exact content of `n`, we denote that it is a string representation of an integer. The output state will reflect this.

Output State: **`n` is a string containing characters from `s` found in `t_set` plus `t`, and the function returns `int(n)`**
