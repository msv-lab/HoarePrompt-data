According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `chars` string and the `permutations` function. The `permutations` function generates all possible arrangements of the characters in `chars`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `perm` is the second permutation of `chars`. To execute the loop one more time, we need to move to the next permutation of `chars`. Given that `perm` is currently the second permutation, the next value of `perm` should be the third permutation.

The only adjustment needed is to ensure that `perm` is set to the third permutation of `chars`. The `candidate` will also need to be updated accordingly to reflect this new permutation. 

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to:
- `chars` remains a string of digits with at least 1 character.
- `perm` should be the third permutation of `chars`.
- `candidate` should be the string representation of the third permutation of `chars`.

State: **`chars` is a string of digits with at least 1 character, `perm` is the third permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is the string representation of the third permutation of `chars`**
