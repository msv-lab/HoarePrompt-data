According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. The loop will iterate over each character in `s`. Since `s` is a string of digits with a length not exceeding 1,000,000, the loop can execute as long as `s` is not an empty string. 

However, the state provided indicates that `s` is a string of digits, which implies that it is non-empty (as it has a length not exceeding 1,000,000). Thus, for the loop to execute, we can assume `s` contains at least one character.

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an empty string, indicating that it has not been updated during the loop. The loop will iterate through each character in `s`, and `c` will take each character of `s` in turn.

So, for the loop to be executed, we need to ensure that `s` is not empty, `t` is a non-empty substring of digits, and `c` will be the first character of `s` during the first iteration.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `t` is a non-empty substring of digits, `t_set` is a set of characters from `t`, `n` is an empty string, `c` is the first character of `s`**
