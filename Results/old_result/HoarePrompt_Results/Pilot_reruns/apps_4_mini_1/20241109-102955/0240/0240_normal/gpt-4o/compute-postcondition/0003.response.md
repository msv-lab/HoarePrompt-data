Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string representing shuffled digits, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number based on the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`, the function yields `candidate`; otherwise, there is no output from the function.***
