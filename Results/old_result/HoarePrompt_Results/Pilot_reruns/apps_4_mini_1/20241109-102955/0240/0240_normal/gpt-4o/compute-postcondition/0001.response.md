`candidate` is assigned the value of `''.join(perm)`, which joins the elements of the `perm` list (which is the first permutation of `chars`) into a single string. The initial state indicates that `chars` is a non-empty string and `perm` is derived from it, but the exact values of `chars` and `perm` are not specified. However, since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be equal to `perm`. The states of `chars` and `perm` remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing shuffled digits, `perm` is the first permutation of chars, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`**.
