Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string of digits, `c` is the second character of `s`, `t` is a non-empty substring containing digits, and `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`. If `c` is in `t_set`, a type error occurs and `n` remains unchanged; otherwise, `n` remains unchanged as there is no else part.***
