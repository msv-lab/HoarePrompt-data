The function accepts a string of digits `num_str` and a non-empty substring `sub`, and returns a boolean indicating whether `sub` is present in `num_str`. However, the function checks if the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`, but `n_len` is not defined within the function, which will cause a NameError. Therefore, the functionality is incomplete as it cannot verify the length condition correctly.
