According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string of digits, it must have more characters remaining after the last iteration for the loop to execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `c` is the third character of `s`. For the loop to execute one more time, `c` must be updated to the fourth character of `s`. This means that the length of `s` must be at least 4 characters long to ensure there is a fourth character to process.

Therefore, the adjustments needed at the start of the next iteration are:
- The character `c` should be the fourth character of `s`.
- `s` must be ensured to be a string of digits with at least 4 characters.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string of digits with at least 4 characters, `c` is the fourth character of `s`, `t` is a non-empty substring containing digits, `t_set` is a set of unique digits from `t`, and if `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is increased by the value of `c`. If `c` is not in `t_set`, the value of `n` remains unchanged.**
