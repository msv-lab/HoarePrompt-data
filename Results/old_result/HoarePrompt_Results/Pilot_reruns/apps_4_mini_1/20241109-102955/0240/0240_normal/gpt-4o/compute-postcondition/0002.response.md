The `yield` statement produces a generator output, which means it returns the value of `candidate` without terminating the function. The variables `chars`, `perm`, and `candidate` remain unchanged, so their previous values are still valid. The output state reflects the current state of the variables and the fact that a value is yielded.

Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string representing shuffled digits, `perm` is the first permutation of chars, `candidate` is the string formed by joining `perm`, and the function yields `candidate`.**
