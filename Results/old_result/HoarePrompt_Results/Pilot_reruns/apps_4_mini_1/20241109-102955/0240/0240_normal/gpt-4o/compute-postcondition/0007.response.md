Postcondition: ***`chars` is a non-empty string representing shuffled digits, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is formed by joining the next `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the `is_valid_number` function with respect to `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`. If `candidate` is not valid, no output occurs from this block.***
