To analyze the given program and its alignment with the problem description, we need to break down its functionality and identify potential edge cases.

### Problem Description
The task is to reconstruct the smallest possible integer \( n \) from a string \( s \) that contains shuffled digits of \( n \) and an appended integer \( k \) (the number of digits in \( n \)). Additionally, we have a non-empty substring \( t \) of \( n \).

### Program Analysis
The function `func_1(s, t)` is designed to:
1. Create a set of characters from the substring \( t \).
2. Iterate through characters in \( s \) and build a string \( n \) consisting of characters from \( s \) that are also in \( t \).
3. Append \( t \) to the constructed string and convert it to an integer.

### Key Observations
1. **Handling of Leading Zeros**: The conversion of the string \( n \) to an integer will remove any leading zeros, which is required to avoid invalid representations (leading zeros are not allowed unless the number is zero).
2. **Construction Logic**: The logic of constructing \( n \) by appending all characters from \( s \) that exist in \( t \) is crucial. However, it does not ensure the smallest possible \( n \) since it does not consider the order of digits or the requirement to minimize the integer representation.

### Potential Edge Cases
- If \( s \) contains digits that can form a smaller \( n \) when arranged correctly but the logic only collects matching digits without ordering them, the smallest \( n \) may not be produced.
- The current implementation does not ensure that the combined digits (from \( s \) and \( t \)) are arranged in such a way that produces the smallest possible integer.

### Output Hints Analysis
The output hints suggest that the function may return an integer value of \( t \) if no characters in \( s \) match those in \( t \). However, the problem statement guarantees that the input data is correct and \( t \) is non-empty, making this scenario irrelevant.

### Conclusion
Given the shortcomings in the program's logic regarding the arrangement of digits to ensure the minimal integer \( n \), the program does not adhere to the requirements specified in the problem description. Therefore, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to guarantee the smallest \( n \) due to its method of constructing \( n \) by simply collecting matching digits from \( s \) without regard for their order or potential to minimize the resultant integer.
