The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates under the constraint that `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. However, since the function signature does not include `n` as a parameter, it is unclear how `n` is utilized or provided to the function. The output is not specified in the provided information, leaving the return value undefined. Therefore, without additional information about how `n` is used within the function or what it returns, it's not possible to accurately describe the functionality.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, and the return value is undefined based on the provided information.**
