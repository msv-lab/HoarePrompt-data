The code prints the value of `n + (10 - n % 10)`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer within the range of 0 to 10^9. The expression `(10 - n % 10)` calculates how much needs to be added to `n` to reach the next multiple of 10. The output does not modify the state of the variable `n`. Therefore, the output state reflects the value of `n` and the result of the calculation.

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9, and the output is `n + (10 - n % 10)`**
