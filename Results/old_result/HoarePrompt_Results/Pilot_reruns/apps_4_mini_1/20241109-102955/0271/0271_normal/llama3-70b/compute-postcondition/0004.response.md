Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9. If `n % 10` is less than or equal to 5, the printed output is the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`, which is `n - n % 10`. Otherwise, the printed output is the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`, which is `n + (10 - n % 10)`. This ensures that the output is always the nearest multiple of 10 to `n`, rounding down if the remainder is 5 or less, and rounding up if it is greater than 5.***
