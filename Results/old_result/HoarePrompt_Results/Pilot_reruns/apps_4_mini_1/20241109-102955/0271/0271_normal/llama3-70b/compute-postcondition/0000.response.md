The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The initial value of `n` is a non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\). After execution, the value of `n` will be whatever integer is provided as input, still adhering to the condition. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an input non-negative integer such that \(0 \leq n \leq 10^9\).

Output State: **`n` is an input non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9**
