Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case where `n` is exactly halfway between two multiples of 10 correctly. According to the problem description, when `n` is 5, it can be rounded to either 0 or 10. However, the current implementation will always round up to 10 when `n` is 5 or any number that is `5` more than a multiple of `10`.

For example:
- If `n = 5`, the output will be `10`, which is not acceptable since `0` is also a valid output.
- If `n = 15`, the output will be `20`, which is not acceptable since `10` is also a valid output.

Thus, the program fails to produce all correct outputs for cases where `n` is a multiple of 10 plus 5. Since it does not handle all potential cases correctly, the program is deemed incorrect.
