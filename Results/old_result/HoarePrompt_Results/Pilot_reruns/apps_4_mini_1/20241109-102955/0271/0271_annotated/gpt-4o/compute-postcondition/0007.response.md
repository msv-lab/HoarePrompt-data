Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer input `n` (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) and calculates a result based on the last digit of `n`. If the last digit (remainder) is less than or equal to 5, it returns `n` minus the last digit; if the last digit is greater than 5, it returns `n` plus the difference between 10 and the last digit. The result is then printed. This ensures that the output is adjusted to the nearest multiple of 10, either rounding down or up based on the value of the last digit. **
