The function accepts no parameters and prints the nearest multiple of 10 based on the input integer `n`, which must be a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9. If `n` is a multiple of 10, it prints `n`. If `n` modulo 10 is less than or equal to 5, it prints the largest multiple of 10 less than or equal to `n`. If `n` modulo 10 is greater than 5, it prints the smallest multiple of 10 greater than `n`. This ensures the output is always a multiple of 10. Edge cases include handling the input of 0, which will simply print 0, and large values of `n` up to 10^9, which will still be processed correctly.
