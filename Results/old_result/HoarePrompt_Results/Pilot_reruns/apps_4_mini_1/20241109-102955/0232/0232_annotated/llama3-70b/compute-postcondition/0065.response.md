The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or if statement we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is True; `i` is 1; `n` is greater than 2; `j` is 2; `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`; `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1 and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
