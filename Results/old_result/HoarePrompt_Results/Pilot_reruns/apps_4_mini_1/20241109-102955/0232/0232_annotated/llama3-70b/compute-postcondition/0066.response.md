Postcondition: ***`found` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 2, `j` is 2, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[2]`, and `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1 if all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`; otherwise, there is no change to `found`, `i`, `n`, `j`, `color`, or `window_counts`.***
