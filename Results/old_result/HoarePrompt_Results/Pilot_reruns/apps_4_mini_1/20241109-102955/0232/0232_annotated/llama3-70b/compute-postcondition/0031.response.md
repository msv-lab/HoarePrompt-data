The statement `window_counts[color] = 0` assigns the value 0 to the key `color` in the dictionary `window_counts`. The variable `color` holds the value of `colors[1]`, and `window_counts` previously included `color` with a value of 1. After the execution of this statement, the value associated with `color` in `window_counts` is changed to 0. The other variables (`found`, `i`, `n`, `j`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `color` is now `colors[1]`, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` includes `color` with a value of 0, and `j` is 1.

Output State: **`color` is now `colors[1]`, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` includes `color` with a value of 0, and `j` is 1**.
