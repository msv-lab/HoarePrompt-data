Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of `n` integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of `m` integers such that 1 ≤ ∑(i=1 to m) k_i ≤ n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping from 1 to m to the corresponding values in `k`, `current_counts` is updated for the color at index `right`, at least one value in `current_counts` is less than the corresponding value in `desired_counts`, and the function returns 'YES'.**
