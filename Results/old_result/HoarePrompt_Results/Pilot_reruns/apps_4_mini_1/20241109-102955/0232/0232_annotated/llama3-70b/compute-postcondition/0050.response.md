The code assigns an empty dictionary to `window_counts`. The initial state indicates that `found` can be either True or False, `i` is 1, and `n` is greater than 1. However, none of these variables are affected by the assignment of an empty dictionary to `window_counts`. 

Therefore, the output state remains unchanged for the other variables.

Output State: **`found` is True or False, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
