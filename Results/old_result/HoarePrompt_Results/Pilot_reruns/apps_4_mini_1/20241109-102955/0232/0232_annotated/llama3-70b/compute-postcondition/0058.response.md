Postcondition: ***`found` is True or False, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[1]`, and `window_counts[color]` is increased by 1. If all values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop. If the condition is not met, `found` remains unchanged.***
