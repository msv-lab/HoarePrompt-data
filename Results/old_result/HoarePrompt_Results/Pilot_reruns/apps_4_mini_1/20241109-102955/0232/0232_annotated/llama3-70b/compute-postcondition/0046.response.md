Output State: **`found` is True if there is a sequence of colors in `colors` from index `i` to `n-1` such that the counts of each color in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. `window_counts` contains the count of each color encountered from `colors[i]` to `colors[j]`, where `j` is the last index processed in the loop. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `found` remains False, `i` is 0, and `window_counts` is still an empty dictionary.**
