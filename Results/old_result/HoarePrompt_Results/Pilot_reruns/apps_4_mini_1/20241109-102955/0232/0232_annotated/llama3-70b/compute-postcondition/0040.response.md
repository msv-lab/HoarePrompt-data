Postcondition: ***`color` is `colors[1]`, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 1, `j` is 1, and if `color` is not already present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` is already present, `window_counts[color]` retains its previous value, which can either be 1 or an incremented value.***
