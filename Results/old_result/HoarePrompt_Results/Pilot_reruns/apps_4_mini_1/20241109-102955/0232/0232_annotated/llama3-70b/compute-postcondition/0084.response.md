Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `i` is 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, and `j` is 2. If `color` is not a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0, resulting in `window_counts` containing the key `color` with a value of 0. If `color` is already present in `window_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
