Output State: **If all values in `current_counts` match those in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES', and `left` will have incremented to the index after the last processed color. If at any point `current_counts[color]` is less than `desired_counts[color]` for any color, the loop continues until `left` equals `n`, and no return occurs. If the loop does not execute (i.e., if `current_counts` does not initially meet the requirements of `desired_counts`), `left` remains 0 and the function does not return anything.**
