Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `m` is a positive integer (1 ≤ m ≤ n), `colors` is a list of n integers where each integer is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}, `k` is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ ∑(i=1 to m) k_i ≤ n, `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping from 1 to m to the corresponding values in k, and `current_counts` is updated for the color at index `right`. If the count of each color in `current_counts` matches the corresponding value in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, if the counts do not match, the function does not return anything.***
