Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `color` is the third element of the `colors` list. If `color` is not already present in `color_counts`, it is added with a value of 0; otherwise, `color_counts[color]` remains unchanged.***
