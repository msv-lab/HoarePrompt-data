Postcondition: ***`found` is True if the values in `window_counts` match the corresponding `counts`, while `window_counts` remains unchanged, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is `i`, and `color` is the value of `colors[i]`. If the condition is not met, `found` remains False, and no changes are made to `window_counts`, `i`, `j`, or `color`.***
