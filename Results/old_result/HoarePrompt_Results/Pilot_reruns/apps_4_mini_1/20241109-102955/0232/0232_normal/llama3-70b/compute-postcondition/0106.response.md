Output State: **If `i` is less than `n`, the loop will execute at most `n - i` times. During each iteration, `color` will take on the value of `colors[j]` where `j` starts at `i` and increments by 1. If `window_counts` matches the corresponding `counts`, then `found` will be True, and the loop will break. If `i` is equal to or greater than `n`, the loop will not execute, and `found` will remain False, `window_counts` will remain unchanged, `i` will remain unchanged, and `j` will not be defined. If no match is found after all iterations, `found` will still be False.**
