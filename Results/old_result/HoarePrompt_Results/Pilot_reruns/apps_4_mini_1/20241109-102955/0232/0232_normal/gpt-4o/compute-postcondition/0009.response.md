Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `right` is 0, and `current_counts[colors[right]]` is equal to `desired_counts[colors[right]] - 1`. If all colors in `desired_counts` have their corresponding `current_counts` equal to the desired counts, the function returns 'YES'. If any color does not meet this condition, the function does not return 'YES' and the state remains unchanged.***
