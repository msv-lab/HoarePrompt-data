The variable `colors` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over the result of `input().split()`. This means that `colors` will now contain a list of integers that have been inputted, where each integer is constrained to be in the range {1, 2, ..., `m`} and the total number of integers in the list will be `n`. The values of `n` and `m` remain unchanged, and there are no effects on `counts`. Therefore, the output state is `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers from input, and `counts` remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers from input, `counts` is unchanged**
