Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 100, `m` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `m` ≤ `n`, `colors` is a list of `n` integers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `color` is the second element of the `colors` list. If `color` is not present in `color_counts`, then `color_counts[color]` is initialized to 0. If `color` was already present in `color_counts`, its value remains unchanged.***
