The values of the variables do not change but we break out of the loop we were directly inside. Therefore, the Output State is: `color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`color_counts` remains unchanged, `found` is True, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `j` is 0, and `window_counts[color]` is either 1 or remains unchanged.**
