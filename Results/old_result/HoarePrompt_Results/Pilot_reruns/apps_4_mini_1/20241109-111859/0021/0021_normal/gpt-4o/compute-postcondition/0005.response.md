The variable `dist2` is assigned the value `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`. The value of `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, and `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in the list `a`. The absolute difference is calculated based on these values.

Since the specific values of `n` and `max_pos` are not provided, we can only describe the possible outcomes. `dist2` will be set to the absolute value of the expression `n - 1 - max_pos`, which could vary depending on the values of `n` and `max_pos`.

Thus, the output state will reflect the state of the variables involved:

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`; `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos)`**
