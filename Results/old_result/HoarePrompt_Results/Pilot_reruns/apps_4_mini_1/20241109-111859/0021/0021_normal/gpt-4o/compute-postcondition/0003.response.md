The code assigns the value of `max_pos` to be the index of the first occurrence of the value `n` in the list `a`. The variable `n` is a positive integer, and `a` is a list of integers. Since the problem states that `n` is between 2 and 100, it is assumed that `n` is present in the list `a`. Therefore, `max_pos` will hold a valid index corresponding to the first occurrence of `n` in `a`. Other variables `min_pos` and `a` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from the input; `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in `a`; `max_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of `n` in `a`.**
