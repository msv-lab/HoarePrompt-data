To determine the output state after executing the given code snippet, we analyze the impact of the code on the variables based on the initial state.

1. **Understanding the Expression**:
   - `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a`.
   - `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`.
   - The expression `abs(pos1 - posn)` calculates the absolute distance between the two indices (`pos1` and `posn`).
   - We then subtract `1` from that distance to find the number of elements between the two indices.
   - The second part, `n - 2`, calculates the maximum possible distance considering the size of the list minus the two endpoints (`1` and `n`).

2. **Calculating `max_dist`**:
   - The `max` function takes two values: `abs(pos1 - posn) - 1` and `n - 2`.
   - The result will be the larger of these two values.

3. **Variables Not Affected**:
   - The values of `n`, `a`, `pos1`, and `posn` will remain unchanged after this assignment, but `max_dist` will be updated.

4. **Output State**:
   - `max_dist` is assigned the calculated value, but since we are not provided with specific values for `pos1`, `posn`, or `n`, we can only describe the relationship.

Given the analysis, the output state that summarizes the information is:

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from the input; `pos1` is the index of `1` in the list `a`; `posn` is the index of `n` in the list `a`; `max_dist` is assigned the value max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
