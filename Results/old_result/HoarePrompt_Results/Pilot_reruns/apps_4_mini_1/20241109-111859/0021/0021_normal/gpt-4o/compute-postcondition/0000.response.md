The variable `n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. However, since the value of `n` is not specified by the input at this moment, we cannot determine its exact value. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` remains a list of n distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to n.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100, and `a` is a list of n distinct integers containing all integers from 1 to n**
