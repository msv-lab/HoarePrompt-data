The variable `a` is assigned a new value based on the input provided. The `input()` function will accept a space-separated string of integers, which will then be converted to a list of integers by `map(int, ...)` and wrapped in `list(...)`. The previous state of `n` remains unchanged, but `a` now holds the values entered by the user. The output state will reflect that `a` is now a list of integers based on the input.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 2 ≤ `n` ≤ 100; `a` is a list of integers from the input**.
