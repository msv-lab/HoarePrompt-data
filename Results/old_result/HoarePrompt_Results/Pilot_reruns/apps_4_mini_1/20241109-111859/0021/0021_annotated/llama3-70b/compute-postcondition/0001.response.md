The variable `a` is assigned a list created by mapping the `int` function over the input values, which are split into separate strings. The input values will be a list of `n` distinct integers. The previous state of `n` remains unchanged, but the value of `a` is now a list of integers derived from the input. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `a` based on the input received.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from input**
