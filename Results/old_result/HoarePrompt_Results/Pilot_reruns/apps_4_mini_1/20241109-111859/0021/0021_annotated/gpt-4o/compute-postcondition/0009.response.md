Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers; `max_pos` is the index of `n` in `a`; `dist1` is `max_pos`; `dist2` is `abs(n - 1 - max_pos); `min_pos` is defined; `dist4` is abs(n - 1 - min_pos); `max_distance` is the maximum of `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, `dist4`, and the function prints `max_distance`.**
