The function `func` accepts two parameters: `n` and `a`. The parameter `n` is an integer such that \( 2 \leq n \leq 100 \), and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. After executing the function body, the output is not specified, but it is implied that the function processes the permutation in some manner based on the constraints provided. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list a of n distinct integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to n.**
