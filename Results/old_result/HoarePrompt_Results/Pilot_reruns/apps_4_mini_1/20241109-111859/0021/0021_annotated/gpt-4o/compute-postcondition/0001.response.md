The variable `a` is assigned the value of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which means it will take a line of input (a string of space-separated integers), split that string into individual components, convert each component to an integer, and then create a list from those integers. The values in `a` will correspond to the integers provided in the input, which must be distinct integers between 1 and `n`, matching the permutation requirement. 

The variable `n` is already defined as an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), but the exact value of `n` is not specified in the initial state. The input provided will determine the content of the list `a`. 

Therefore, the output state includes the unchanged value of `n` and the new list `a`, which will hold the integers inputted by the user.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100 (inclusive), `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers representing a permutation of the integers from 1 to `n`**
