Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n` (where 2 ≤ n ≤ 100) and a list `a` of `n` distinct integers representing a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. It calculates the maximum distance between the indices of the integers 1 and `n` in the list and prints this maximum distance, adjusted by the minimum distance between them. The function assumes valid inputs according to the given constraints and does not handle cases where the input doesn't meet these constraints. **
