To determine the output state, we need to analyze the provided code snippet and its impact on the initial state.

1. We have `pos1`, which is the index of `1` in list `a`.
2. We have `posn`, which is the index of `n` in list `a`.
3. The snippet calculates `max_dist` using the formula `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`.

Since `pos1`, `posn`, and `n` are defined in the initial state and are integers, we can use these to compute `max_dist`.

- `abs(pos1 - posn)` gives the absolute difference between the positions of `1` and `n`.
- Subtracting `1` from this value will adjust for the distance calculation.
- `n - 2` gives another potential distance based on `n`.

The `max` function will take the larger of these two computed values to define `max_dist`.

Therefore, the output state will reflect the computed value of `max_dist`, along with the unchanged initial state of the other variables.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 ≤ n ≤ 100; `a` is a list of n distinct integers from input; `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`; `posn` is the index of n in list `a`; `max_dist` is calculated as max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)**
