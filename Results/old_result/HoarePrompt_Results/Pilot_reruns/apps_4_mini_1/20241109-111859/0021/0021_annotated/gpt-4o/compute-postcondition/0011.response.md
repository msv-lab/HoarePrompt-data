Functionality: ** The function accepts an integer `n`, which must be between 2 and 100 inclusive, and a list `a` containing `n` distinct integers that form a permutation of integers from 1 to `n`. It calculates and prints the maximum distance between the positions of the integer `1` and the integer `n` in the list `a`, relative to the start and end of the list. The function does not return any value. **
