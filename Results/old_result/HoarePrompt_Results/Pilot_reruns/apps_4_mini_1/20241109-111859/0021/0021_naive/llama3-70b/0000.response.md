To evaluate the given program against the problem description, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description Recap
The task is to find the maximum possible distance between the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in a permutation of distinct integers from 1 to n after performing exactly one swap.

### Program Analysis
```python
n = int(input())
a = list(map(int, input().split()))
pos1 = a.index(1)
posn = a.index(n)
max_dist = max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
min_dist = min(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)
print(max(max_dist, n - 1 - min_dist))
```

1. **Input Handling**: The program correctly reads the size of the permutation (`n`) and the permutation itself (`a`).
   
2. **Finding Positions**: It uses `a.index(1)` to find the position of the minimum element (1) and `a.index(n)` to find the position of the maximum element (n).

3. **Distance Calculation**:
   - `max_dist` is calculated as `max(abs(pos1 - posn) - 1, n - 2)`. This seems incorrect, as it doesn't consider the actual positions after a swap â€” it just calculates the distance between the current positions minus one, or a constant `n - 2`.
   - `min_dist` is similarly calculated, which is not necessary for the maximum distance.

4. **Output Calculation**: The final output uses the maximum of `max_dist` and `n - 1 - min_dist`. However, this logic does not adhere to the requirement of maximizing the distance after a swap.

### Potential Case for Failure
Consider the case when:
Input:
```
4
1 2 3 4
```
Here, the current distance between 1 (at index 0) and 4 (at index 3) is 3. Performing a swap between 1 and 4 would yield:
```
4 2 3 1
```
The distance between 4 and 1 would be 3 again. 

However, the program would compute:
- `pos1 = 0`, `posn = 3`
- `max_dist = max(3 - 1, 2) = max(2, 2) = 2` (which is incorrect)
- `min_dist = min(3 - 1, 2) = min(2, 2) = 2`
- The print statement would output `max(2, 4 - 1 - 2) = max(2, 1) = 2`, which is incorrect.

The program does not correctly compute the maximum distance possible after exactly one swap, as it does not account for all possible swaps to calculate the maximum distance.

### Conclusion
The program fails to fulfill the requirement of maximizing the distance between the minimum and maximum elements after a swap.

Correctness: **False**.
