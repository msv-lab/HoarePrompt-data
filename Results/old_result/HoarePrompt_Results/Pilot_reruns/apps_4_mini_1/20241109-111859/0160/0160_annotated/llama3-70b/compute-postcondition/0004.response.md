The variable `gcd` is updated to be the greatest common divisor of the current value of `gcd` and `A[i]`. The initial value of `gcd` is `A[0]`, and `i` is 1, which means `A[i]` corresponds to `A[1]`. Therefore, the value of `gcd` will now be the `gcd` of `A[0]` and `A[1]`. The states of the other variables are not affected, so the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `gcd` is the gcd of `A[0]` and `A[1]`, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `gcd` is the gcd of `A[0]` and `A[1]`, `i` is 1**
