Postcondition: ***`gcd` is at least 1, `i` is 1, and `max_divisor` is at least 1. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. This ensures that `max_divisor` retains its previous value or is set to the quotient of `gcd` and `i`, depending on the condition. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged.***
