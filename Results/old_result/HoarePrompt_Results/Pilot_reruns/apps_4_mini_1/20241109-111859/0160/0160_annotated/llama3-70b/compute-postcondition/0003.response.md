To determine the necessary states for the loop to execute, let's analyze the provided state and the for loop structure.

1. The variable `N` is an integer that satisfies the condition \(2 \leq N \leq 500\). This means that the loop will iterate at least once, as the range starts from 1 and goes up to \(N-1\).
2. The variable `K` does not influence the loop's execution directly, as it is not used within the for loop.
3. The list `A` has `N` integers, and each integer satisfies the condition \(1 \leq A[i] \leq 10^6\). This means that there are valid elements in the list.
4. The variable `gcd` is initialized to the value of `A[0]`, but it does not affect the execution of the loop either, as it is not modified before the loop starts.

Given the loop definition `for i in range(1, N):`, the loop will execute if `N` is at least 2, which it is, according to the provided state.

Now we need to identify the states that are relevant at the start of the loop:

- The loop index `i` will be initialized to 1 at the start of the first iteration.
- `gcd`, initialized to `A[0]`, will be relevant during the loop but is not necessary to modify since it is already set.

Thus, the necessary states for the loop to execute correctly are:

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `gcd` is `A[0]`, `i` is 1**
