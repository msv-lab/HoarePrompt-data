Postcondition: ***`gcd` is at least 9, `i` is 3, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i` if `gcd` is divisible by `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is also updated to the maximum value between its current value and `gcd // i`. If `i * i` equals `gcd`, `max_divisor` remains unchanged. If `gcd` is not divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` remains as it was before executing this fragment.***
