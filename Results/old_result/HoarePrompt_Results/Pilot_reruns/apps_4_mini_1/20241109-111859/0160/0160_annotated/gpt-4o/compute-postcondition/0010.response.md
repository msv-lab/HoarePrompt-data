The statement `divisors.add(i)` adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. The value of `i` is calculated as `int(math.sqrt(x))`, but since `x` is not provided in the initial state, we cannot determine its specific value. However, the operation does not modify any other variables apart from adding `i` to the set `divisors`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `divisors` now includes the new value `i`.

Output State: **`N` is an integer between 2 and 500, `K` is a non-negative integer up to 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers where each integer is between 1 and 10^6, `i` is int(math.sqrt(x)), and `divisors` now includes `i`.**
