The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. `x` is an integer which is subject to the constraints provided. After executing the function body, it calculates `divisors`, which is a set containing all unique divisors of `x`. The function then returns the sorted list of `divisors` in reverse order. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept an integer `x` and return a sorted list of its unique divisors in reverse order.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x and returns a sorted list of unique divisors of x in reverse order.**
