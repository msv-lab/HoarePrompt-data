The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its current value and `gcd // i`. Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 1, `gcd // i` will be equal to `gcd`. This means that `max_divisor` will either remain the same or increase to `gcd`. Therefore, the output state will reflect that `max_divisor` could be either unchanged or updated to the value of `gcd`.

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is either `gcd` or remains the same, `i` is 1**
