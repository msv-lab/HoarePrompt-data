The value of `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and the result of `gcd // i`. Since `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `gcd // i` will yield a non-negative integer. However, without knowing the specific values of `max_divisor`, `gcd`, and `i`, we cannot determine the exact new value of `max_divisor`. Therefore, the output state reflects the fact that `max_divisor` is updated based on the maximum calculation and the state of the other variables remains unchanged. 

Output State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1; `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `gcd // i`.**
