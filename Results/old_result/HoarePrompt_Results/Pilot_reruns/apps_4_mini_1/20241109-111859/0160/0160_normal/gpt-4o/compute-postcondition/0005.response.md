According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(x)) + 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, the variable `i` must be less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at its value in the loop range. In the next iteration, `i` will increase by 1. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is still within the valid range for the loop to execute again. 

To adjust the state, we need to ensure that `i` is equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. This indicates it is the last value for which the loop can execute. Additionally, `divisors` may need to reflect any changes based on the new value of `i` if `x` is divisible by `i`. However, since it is already established that `divisors` includes 1 and potentially `x` if `x` is divisible by `i`, it does not require further adjustment for this task. 

Thus, we need to ensure that `x` is a square number or that `x` is such that `int(math.sqrt(x))` is reached. 

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `divisors` is a set that contains 1 and potentially `x`, `i` is int(math.sqrt(x))**
