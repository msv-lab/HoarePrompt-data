According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the upper limit defined by `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently at a value that is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(gcd))`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.

Since the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `int(math.sqrt(gcd)) + 1`, if `i` is currently `k`, it must be updated to `k + 1` for the loop to execute again. The upper limit does not change, as it is defined by `gcd`.

State: **`gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum of its previous value and `i` if `gcd` is divisible by `i`, `i` is updated to `k + 1, where k is the current value of i`**
