The code adds the value `x // i` to the set `divisors`. The variable `i` is defined as the integer square root of `x`, which means that `i` is a non-negative integer such that `i * i <= x < (i + 1) * (i + 1)`. Therefore, `x // i` will be an integer as well.

Since `divisors` now includes `i`, we need to consider that the value being added is `x // i`. The states of the other variables are not affected by this operation.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, and `divisors` now includes `x // i`**
