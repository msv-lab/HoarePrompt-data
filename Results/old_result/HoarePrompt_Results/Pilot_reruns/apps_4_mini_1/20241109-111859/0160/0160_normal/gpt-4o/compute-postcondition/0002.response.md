The code adds the value of `i` to the set `divisors`. Since `i` is initialized to 1, the set `divisors` will now contain the value 1. The other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `divisors` now contains {1}, `x` is an integer such that x >= 1, `i` is 1.

Output State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6, `divisors` now contains {1}, `x` is an integer such that x >= 1, `i` is 1**
