According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `N`. The loop starts from `i = 1` and goes until `i < N`, which means for the loop to execute, `N` must be at least 2, which is already satisfied by the given state (2 <= N <= 500). 

At the beginning of the loop, `i` must be initialized to 1, as the loop starts from this value. The variable `gcd` is assigned the value of `A[0]`, which is already initialized before the loop. 

Thus, the necessary states for the loop to execute are that `i` is initialized to 1 and that `gcd` has the value of `A[0]`, which is valid since `A` is a list of `N` integers.

State: **`N` is an integer such that 2 <= `N` <= 500, `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= `K` <= 10^9, `A` is a list of `N` integers, `gcd` is the value of `A[0]`, `i` is 1**
