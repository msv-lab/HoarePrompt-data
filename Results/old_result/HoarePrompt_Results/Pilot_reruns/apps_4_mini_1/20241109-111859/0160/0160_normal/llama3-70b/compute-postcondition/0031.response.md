Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers, `N` and `K`, and a list of `N` integers `A`. It computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the integers in `A` and then finds and prints the largest divisor of this gcd. The function assumes valid input based on provided constraints and does not handle cases where the input is malformed or out of bounds. **
