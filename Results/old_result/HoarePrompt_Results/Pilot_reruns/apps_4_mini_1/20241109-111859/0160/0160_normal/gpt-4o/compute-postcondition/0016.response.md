The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. The parameter `x` is an integer, and it is presumed to be part of the calculations involving `N`, `K`, and `A`, which are described as follows: `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500; `K` is a non-negative integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9; `A` is a list of N integers where each A[i] is an integer such that 1 <= A[i] <= 10^6. The function computes all divisors of `x` up to `sqrt(x)` and returns them as a sorted list in descending order.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, calculates all divisors of x, and returns a sorted list of these divisors in descending order.**
