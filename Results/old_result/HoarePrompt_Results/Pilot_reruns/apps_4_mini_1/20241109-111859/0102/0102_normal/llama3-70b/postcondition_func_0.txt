The function accepts no parameters and reads an integer input `s` from the user, which must be between 0 and 99. Based on the value of `s`, it prints the English word representation of that number. It handles numbers less than 10 using the `ones` list, numbers between 10 and 19 using the `teens` list, and numbers from 20 to 99 by combining entries from the `tens` and `ones` lists with a hyphen if necessary. The function does not return any value. It also does not handle cases where the input is outside the range of 0 to 99, which could lead to unexpected behavior if invalid input is given.
