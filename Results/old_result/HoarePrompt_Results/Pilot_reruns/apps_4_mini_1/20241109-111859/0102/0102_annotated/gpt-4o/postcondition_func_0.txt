The function accepts an integer `n` and aims to return its English word representation for numbers in the range 0 to 99. It returns 'zero' for 0, the corresponding word for numbers 1-9, 'ten' for 10, and the appropriate words for numbers 11-19. For multiples of ten in the range 20-90, it returns the corresponding word from the `tens` list. For other numbers between 10 and 99 that are not multiples of ten, it returns a concatenation of the word for the tens and the word for the units with a hyphen in between. However, the function contains an error due to the use of an undefined variable `n` instead of `s`, which prevents it from executing correctly. As a result, it does not handle any cases properly and would raise a NameError instead of returning the expected string representations.
