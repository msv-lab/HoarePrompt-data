Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ `s` ≤ 99. If `s` is between 10 and 99 and is a multiple of 10, the function returns the corresponding string from `tens[s // 10]`. If `s` is between 10 and 99 and is not a multiple of 10, the function returns the string from `tens[s // 10]` concatenated with a hyphen and the string from `ones[s % 10]`, effectively representing the English word for the number `s`. If `s` is less than 10 or greater than 99, the function does not execute any return statement.***
