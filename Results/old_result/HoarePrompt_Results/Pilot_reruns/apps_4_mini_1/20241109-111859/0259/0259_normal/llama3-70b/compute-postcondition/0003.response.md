The values of `s` and `d` are assigned based on the input provided by the user, which gets split into two separate integers. The initial state indicates that `n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, and `buses` is an empty list. Since `s` and `d` are not previously defined in the initial state, they will take on values based on user input. The other variables remain unaffected.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `t` is an integer between 1 and 100000, `buses` is an empty list, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
