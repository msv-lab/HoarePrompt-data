The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 

- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes (1 <= n <= 100).
- `t` is a positive integer representing the time to wait (1 <= t <= 100000).
- `bus_routes` is a list of tuples where each tuple contains two positive integers `s_i` and `d_i` representing the start time and duration of each bus route, respectively (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000 for each bus route i, where 1 <= i <= n).

After executing the function body, it calculates the smallest wait time from all bus routes based on the start times `s_i` and the time `t`, and then returns `chosen_route`, which corresponds to the bus route with the minimum wait time.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n (number of bus routes), t (time to wait), and bus_routes (list of tuples with start and duration times), and returns the chosen bus route with the smallest wait time calculated from the bus routes.**
