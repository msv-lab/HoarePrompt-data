Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is `s_0` from bus_routes[0], `d_i` is `d_0` from bus_routes[0], `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0. If `(t - s_i) % d_i` equals 0, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time until the next bus arrives.***
