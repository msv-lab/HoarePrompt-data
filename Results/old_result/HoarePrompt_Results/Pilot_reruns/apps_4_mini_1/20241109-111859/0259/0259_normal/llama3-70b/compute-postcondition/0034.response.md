Functionality: ** The function accepts no parameters but prompts the user for input consisting of two integers `n` and `t`. It then reads `n` pairs of integers `(s, d)` representing bus schedules into a list. The function calculates the earliest bus time based on the formula `(t - s) % d` for each bus and returns the 1-based index of the bus that has the minimum time. If no buses are provided, it will print `-1`. The function prints the result, which indicates the bus with the earliest arrival time based on the input data. **
