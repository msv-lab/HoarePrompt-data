The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are updated to the values from `bus_routes[i]`. The previous values of `s_i` and `d_i` are replaced, but the specific values of `bus_routes[i]` are not provided in the initial state. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, `wait_time` is calculated based on the relationship between the new `s_i` and `t`, and `i` is incremented by 1.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, `wait_time` is calculated based on the new `s_i` and `t`, and `i` is incremented by 1.**
