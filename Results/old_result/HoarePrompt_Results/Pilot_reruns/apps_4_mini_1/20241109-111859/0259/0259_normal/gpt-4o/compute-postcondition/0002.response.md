According to the code, the loop executes over the range determined by the variable `n`. Since `n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), the loop will execute at least once, as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. 

Before the loop starts, the variables `i`, `s_i`, `d_i`, `min_wait_time`, and `chosen_route` need to be established for the first iteration. The variable `i` should be initialized to 0 for the first iteration of the loop. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` will correspond to the first bus route when `i` is 0, meaning we need to reference the values of `s_0` and `d_0` (the starting values for the first route). The `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` will remain as initially defined since they are meant to be adjusted within the loop body.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is `s_0`, `d_i` is `d_0`, `min_wait_time` is float('inf'), `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0**
