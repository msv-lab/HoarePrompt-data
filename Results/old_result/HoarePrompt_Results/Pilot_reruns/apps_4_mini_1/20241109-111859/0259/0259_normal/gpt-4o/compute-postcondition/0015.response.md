The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `0`. This assignment does not depend on the previous values of any other variables, and it does not affect them either. The values of `n`, `t`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `i` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `wait_time` is now 0.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is updated to the new value from `bus_routes[i]`, `i` is incremented by 1, and `wait_time` is now 0**
