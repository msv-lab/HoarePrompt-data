Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated from `bus_routes[i + 1]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0, `min_wait_time` is updated to 0, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, while `min_wait_time` is updated to this newly calculated `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` remains set to `i + 1`. Additionally, the value of `wait_time` will always be non-negative since it represents a waiting period based on the bus schedule.***
