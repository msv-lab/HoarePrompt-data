The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The initial state indicates that `s_i` and `d_i` are updated from `bus_routes[i + 1]`, and since `t` is a positive integer, the expression `(t - s_i) % d_i` will yield a non-negative result. The value of `wait_time` is therefore calculated based on the values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged in this statement.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `i + 1`, `t` is a positive integer, `s_i` and `d_i` are updated from `bus_routes[i + 1]`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.**
