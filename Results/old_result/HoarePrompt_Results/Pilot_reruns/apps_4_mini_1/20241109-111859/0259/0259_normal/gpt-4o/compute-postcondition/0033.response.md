Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the smallest wait time calculated from all bus routes based on the start times `s_i` and the time `t`. `chosen_route` is the index (1-based) of the bus route with the smallest wait time. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains as float('inf') and `chosen_route` remains -1. If all `s_i` are less than `t`, the `wait_time` will be calculated based on the modulo condition, and `min_wait_time` will reflect the minimum wait time from those calculations. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` will be directly calculated as `s_i - t`. Thus, if there are no valid bus routes (e.g., all `s_i` conditions lead to infinite wait times), `min_wait_time` will remain unchanged at float('inf') and `chosen_route` will remain -1.**
