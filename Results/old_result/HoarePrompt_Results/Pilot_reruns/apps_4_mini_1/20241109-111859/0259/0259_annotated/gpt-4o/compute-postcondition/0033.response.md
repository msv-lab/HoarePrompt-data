Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the minimum wait time calculated based on the bus routes, with a value of positive infinity if no route is chosen; `chosen_route` is the index (1-based) of the chosen bus route or remains -1 if no suitable route exists. The loop executes `n` times if `n` is at least 1. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, leaving `min_wait_time` as positive infinity and `chosen_route` as -1. Each `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers from `bus_routes`, and `wait_time` is calculated for each route based on the comparisons with `t`. If no `wait_time` is less than the initial `min_wait_time`, then it remains unchanged, and if no valid routes are found, `chosen_route` remains -1.**
