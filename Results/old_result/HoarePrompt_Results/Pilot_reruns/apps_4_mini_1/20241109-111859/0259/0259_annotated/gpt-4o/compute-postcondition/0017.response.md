Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is `n`, and `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]`. If the time `t` minus `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0, indicating that the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, representing the time to wait for the next bus, ensuring that it is non-negative. This logic accounts for all scenarios including when `t` is less than, equal to, or greater than `s_i` in relation to the bus schedule determined by `d_i`.***
