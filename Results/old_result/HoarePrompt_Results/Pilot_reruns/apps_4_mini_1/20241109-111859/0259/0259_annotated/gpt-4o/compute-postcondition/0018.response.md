Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is `n`, and `s_i`, `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `t` minus `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is set to 0, indicating that the bus arrives exactly at time `t`. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, ensuring it represents a non-negative waiting time for the next bus, effectively covering all scenarios where `t` is less than, equal to, or greater than `s_i` in relation to the bus schedule determined by `d_i`.***
