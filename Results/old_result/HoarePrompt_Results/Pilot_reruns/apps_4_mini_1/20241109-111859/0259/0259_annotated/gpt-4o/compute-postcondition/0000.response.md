The code assigns `min_wait_time` to positive infinity (float representation), which means it is initialized to a value that is greater than any finite number. The previous values of `n`, `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is that `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), each `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000) for i from 1 to n; `min_wait_time` is set to positive infinity**.
