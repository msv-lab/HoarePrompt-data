The `wait_time` variable is initialized to 0. The values of `n`, `t`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the current values of the variables involved.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is `n`, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[n]`, `wait_time` is 0**
