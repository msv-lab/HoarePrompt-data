According to the code, the loop iterates over a range from `0` to `n-1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `n + 1`, which is beyond the range of the loop (since the loop index `i` should be less than `n`). Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `n`, and `n` must remain unchanged as a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100).

State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is n, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`.**
