Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), each `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers (1 <= s_i, d_i <= 100000) for i from 1 to n. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. In all cases, `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity if no `wait_time` is less than it, and `chosen_route` remains -1 if no route is chosen. The variable `i` is incremented by 1 through each iteration, starting from 0.***
