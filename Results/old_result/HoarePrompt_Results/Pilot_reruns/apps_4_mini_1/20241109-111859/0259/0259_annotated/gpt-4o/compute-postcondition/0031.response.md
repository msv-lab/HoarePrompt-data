Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 <= n <= 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 <= t <= 100000), `i` is n + 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. The `wait_time` is calculated based on the comparison of `s_i` and `t`, ensuring it is non-negative. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `wait_time` is greater than or equal to `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` remain unchanged. In all cases, `wait_time` is guaranteed to be non-negative.***
