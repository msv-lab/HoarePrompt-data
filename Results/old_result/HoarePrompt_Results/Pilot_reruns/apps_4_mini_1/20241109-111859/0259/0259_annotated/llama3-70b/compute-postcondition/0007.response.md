The code appends a tuple `(s, d)` to the list `buses`. Since `buses` initially contains one tuple, after executing the code, `buses` will contain two tuples: the original tuple and the newly appended tuple. The values of `n` and `t` are not affected by this operation, and their specific values are not disclosed, but they remain as positive integers. Therefore, the output state reflects the updated content of `buses` while retaining the values of `n` and `t`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the previous value, `t` is a positive integer, and `buses` contains two tuples: the original tuple and the newly assigned tuple (s, d)**
