The variable `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The value of `i` is not specified in the initial state, so we do not have the exact value for `chosen_route`. However, the assignment does not affect other variables. Therefore, the output state indicates that `chosen_route` is assigned a value based on the current value of `i`.

Output State: **`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`; `chosen_route` is assigned the value of `i + 1**.
