The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on predefined constraints: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 100), `t` is a positive integer (1 ≤ t ≤ 100000), and for each bus route, `s_i` and `d_i` are positive integers (1 ≤ s_i, d_i ≤ 100000). 

The function's output is determined by these constraints, but the details about the specific outputs based on the inputs are not provided. Thus, the functionality of the function is not explicitly defined in terms of what it returns based on the input parameters.

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters and operates based on internal constraints related to bus routes, but the specific return value is not defined.**
