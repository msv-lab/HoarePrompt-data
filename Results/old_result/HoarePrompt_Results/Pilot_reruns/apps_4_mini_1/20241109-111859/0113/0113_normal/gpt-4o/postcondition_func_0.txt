The function accepts a positive integer `n` (where 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9) and a non-negative integer `k`, computes a multiplier equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`, and returns the value of `n` multiplied by the result of `multiplier` divided by the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`. The output value `x` is calculated based on these inputs.
