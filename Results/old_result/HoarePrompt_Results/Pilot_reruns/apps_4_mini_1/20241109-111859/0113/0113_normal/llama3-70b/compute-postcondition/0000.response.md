The values of `n` and `k` are assigned based on the input provided, where `map(int, input().split())` takes two space-separated values from input and converts them to integers. The previous values of `n` and `k` are overwritten by the new input values. 

The output state will reflect that `n` is now a new positive integer (a specific input value) and `k` is a new non-negative integer (a specific input value) as provided by the user. 

Output State: **`n` is a new positive integer, `k` is a new non-negative integer**
