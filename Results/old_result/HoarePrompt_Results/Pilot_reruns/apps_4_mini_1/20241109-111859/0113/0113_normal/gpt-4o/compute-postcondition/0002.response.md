The function returns `x`, which is assigned the value of `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. The specific values of `n` and `multiplier` are not provided, but `x` depends on these calculations. The return statement does not change the state of the variables `n` and `multiplier`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 10^9; `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000; and the function returns `x`**
