The code executes a print statement that outputs `-1`. The values of the variables `res` and `s` are not altered as a result of this print statement. Therefore, the output state reflects the unchanged values of these variables while indicating the printed value.

Output State: **`res` is a string consisting of characters from 'a' to 'z', and `s` remains unchanged, and the function prints -1**
