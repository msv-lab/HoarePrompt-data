The value of `res` is updated by appending `char`, which is 'a'. Therefore, `res` will now include the previous value plus 'a', resulting in `res` being updated to include 'a' twice. The other variables `s` and `char` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `s` includes 'a' and 'b', `char` is 'a', `res` is updated to include 'a' appended to its previous value.

Output State: **`s` includes 'a' and 'b', `char` is 'a', `res` is updated to include 'a' appended to its previous value**
