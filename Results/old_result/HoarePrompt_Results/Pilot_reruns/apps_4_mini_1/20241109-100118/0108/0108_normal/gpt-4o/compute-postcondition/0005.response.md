Postcondition: ***`s` is an input string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 0. If the character at position `i` in the string `s` matches the character at position `j` in `target`, then `j` is increased by 1. If the character does not match, `j` remains unchanged. Additionally, since `s` has a length of at least 1, the character at `s[0]` is always defined.***
