The value of `j` is incremented by 1, but its previous value is unknown since it is only stated that `j` is less than 26. Therefore, the output state reflects that `j` has been increased by 1, while the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`s` is an input string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 100,000; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 2; `j` is increased by 1**
