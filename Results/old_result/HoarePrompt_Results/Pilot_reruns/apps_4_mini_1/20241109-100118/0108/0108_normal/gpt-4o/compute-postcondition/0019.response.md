Postcondition: ***If `j` is equal to `target_len`, then the function prints `target`. If `j` is less than `target_len`, which occurs when the string `s` does not contain all letters from 'a' to 'z' or is empty, then the function prints -1. In both cases, `i` is equal to the length of `s` or some value less than that based on the characters found, and if `s` is empty or does not begin with 'a', then `i` is 0 and `j` remains 0.***
