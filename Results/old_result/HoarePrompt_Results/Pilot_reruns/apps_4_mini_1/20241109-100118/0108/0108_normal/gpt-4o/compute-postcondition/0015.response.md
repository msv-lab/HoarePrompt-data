According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than the length of the string `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, `j` is unchanged and must be less than 26, and the length of `s` is between 1 and 100,000. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `len(s)` which is unknown, but `i` currently being 3 ensures that as long as `len(s) > 3`, it can execute again. The variable `j` must still be less than 26 to allow the loop to proceed.

Since `j` remains unchanged and must be less than 26, we do not need to adjust it. We do not have information about the length of `s` but since `s` consists of small English letters and can be up to 100,000 characters long, we can assume it is at least 4 characters long for the loop to execute again. 

Thus, the only state that may need to be adjusted is ensuring that `len(s)` is greater than 3, which implies that `i` should remain less than `len(s)`.

State: **`s` is an input string consisting of small English letters with a length greater than 3; `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'; `target_len` is 26; `i` is 3; `j` remains unchanged and must be less than 26.**
