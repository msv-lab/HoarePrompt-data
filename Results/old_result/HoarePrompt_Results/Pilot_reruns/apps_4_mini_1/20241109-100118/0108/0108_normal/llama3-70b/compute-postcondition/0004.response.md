The value of `res` is updated by concatenating `char` to it. Since `res` is initially an empty string and `char` is 'a', after execution, `res` becomes 'a'. The other variable `s` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `res` is 'a', and `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
