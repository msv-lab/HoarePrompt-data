Postcondition: ***`res` is a string consisting of characters from 'a' to 'z', where each character is repeated according to its original occurrences in `s`. If `res` contains all 26 letters of the alphabet, the function prints `res`. If `res` does not contain all 26 letters, the function prints -1, `s` remains unchanged, and `res` remains a string consisting of characters from 'a' to 'z', reflecting any modifications made during previous operations.***
