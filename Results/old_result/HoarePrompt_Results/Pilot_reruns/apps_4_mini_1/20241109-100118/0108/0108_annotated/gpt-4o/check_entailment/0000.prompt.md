You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given a string s consisting of |s| small english letters.

In one move you can replace any character of this string to the next character in alphabetical order (a will be replaced with b, s will be replaced with t, etc.). You cannot replace letter z with any other letter.

Your target is to make some number of moves (not necessary minimal) to get string abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz (english alphabet) as a subsequence. Subsequence of the string is the string that is obtained by deleting characters at some positions. You need to print the string that will be obtained from the given string and will be contain english alphabet as a subsequence or say that it is impossible.


-----Input-----

The only one line of the input consisting of the string s consisting of |s| (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5) small english letters.


-----Output-----

If you can get a string that can be obtained from the given string and will contain english alphabet as a subsequence, print it. Otherwise print «-1» (without quotes).


-----Examples-----

Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    s = input()
    #State of the program here: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters from user input
    target = 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    #State of the program here: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters from user input, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'
    target_len = len(target)
    #State of the program here: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters from user input, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', and `target_len` is 26
    i, j = 0, 0
    #State of the program here: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters from user input, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0
    while i < len(s) and j < target_len:
        if s[i] == target[j]:
            j += 1
        
        i += 1
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: `if s is an empty string then i is 0 and j is 0. If s contains at least one character and does not contain all characters of target, loop will execute until either i reaches len(s) or j reaches 26, with i being equal to len(s) and j reflecting the number of matched characters from target. If s contains all characters from target, then i equals len(s) and j equals 26.`
    if (j == target_len) :
        print(target)
        #State of the program here: `if s is an empty string then i is 0 and j is 0. If s contains at least one character and does not contain all characters of target, loop will execute until either i reaches len(s) or j reaches 26, with i being equal to len(s) and j reflecting the number of matched characters from target. If s contains all characters from target, then i equals len(s) and j equals 26; the function prints target.
    #State of the program after the if part has been executed: `if s is an empty string then i is 0 and j is 0. If s contains at least one character and does not contain all characters of target, loop will execute until either i reaches len(s) or j reaches 26, with i being equal to len(s) and j reflecting the number of matched characters from target. If s contains all characters from target, then i equals len(s) and j equals 26; the function prints target.
    else :
        print(-1)
        #State of the program here: if s is an empty string then i is 0 and j is 0. If s contains at least one character and does not contain all characters of target, loop will execute until either i reaches len(s) or j reaches 26, with i being equal to len(s) and j reflecting the number of matched characters from target. If s contains all characters from target, then i equals len(s) and j equals 26. The output from the print statement is -1.
    #State of the program after the else part has been executed: if s is an empty string then i is 0 and j is 0. If s contains at least one character and does not contain all characters of target, loop will execute until either i reaches len(s) or j reaches 26, with i being equal to len(s) and j reflecting the number of matched characters from target. If s contains all characters from target, then i equals len(s) and j equals 26. The output from the print statement is -1.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *If `j` equals `target_len`, the function prints `target`. If `j` does not equal `target_len`, the function prints -1. The variable `j` reflects the number of matched characters from `target`, which could be 0 if `s` is an empty string, or could be between 1 and 26 if `s` contains some characters but not all from `target`. If `s` contains all characters from `target`, `j` equals 26. Thus, the function's output depends on whether all characters from `target` are matched.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function accepts no parameters and reads a string `s` from user input. It checks if `s` contains all the letters of the English alphabet ('a' to 'z'). If it does, the function prints the entire alphabet; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not handle empty input, and if `s` is empty, it will print -1, as no letters can be matched. Additionally, the function only checks for the presence of the letters but does not validate the input string for non-lowercase characters or other unexpected inputs.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
