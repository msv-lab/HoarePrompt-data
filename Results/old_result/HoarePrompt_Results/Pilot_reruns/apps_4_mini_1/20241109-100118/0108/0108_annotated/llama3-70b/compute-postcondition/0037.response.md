Output State: **`res` is a string composed of letters from `s` sorted in alphabetical order, with each letter repeated according to its occurrences in `s`. `s` will be empty after the loop if it originally contained letters from 'a' to 'z'. If `s` contains letters not in the alphabet or is already empty initially, `res` will remain empty, and `s` will be unchanged. If `s` contains no occurrences of the current `char` in the loop (from 'a' to 'z'), the inner loop will not execute for that character, and the next character in `alphabet` will be processed.**
