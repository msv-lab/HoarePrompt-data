Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is increased by 1, and `i` is increased by 1, ensuring that `len(s)` is still greater than `i` and `target_len` remains greater than 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `target[j]`, `j` remains 1, and `i` is still increased by 1, while also maintaining the initial conditions.***
