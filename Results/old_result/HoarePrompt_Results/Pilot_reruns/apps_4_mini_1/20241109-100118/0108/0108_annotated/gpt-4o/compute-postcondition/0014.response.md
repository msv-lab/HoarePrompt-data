The value of `i` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `i` is not specified, only that it is currently less than `len(s)`. The state of variables `s`, `j`, and `target_len` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `target_len` is greater than 1.

Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `i` is increased by 1, `len(s)` is greater than `i`, and `target_len` is greater than 1**
