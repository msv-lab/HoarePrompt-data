The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that follows `char` in the ASCII table. The value of `char` is 'a', and the ASCII value of 'a' is 97. The next character, which is 'b', has an ASCII value of 98. Therefore, `s` will become 'bb' after the execution of the code. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`alphabet` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'aaa', `char` is 'a', `s` is 'bb'**
