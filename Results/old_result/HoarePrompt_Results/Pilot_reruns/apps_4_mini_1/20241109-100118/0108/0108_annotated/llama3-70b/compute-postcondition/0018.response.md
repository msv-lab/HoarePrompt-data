In this case, `res` is a string of 'a's followed by an 'a', and `char` is 'a'. The operation `res += char` appends the value of `char` (which is 'a') to the end of `res`. Therefore, the new value of `res` will be the previous value plus one additional 'a'. The variable `s` remains unaffected as it is not involved in this operation.

Thus, the output state is: `s` contains at least one occurrence of 'b', `res` is a string of 'a's followed by 'aa', and `char` is 'a'.

Output State: **`s` contains at least one occurrence of 'b', `res` is a string of 'a's followed by 'aa', `char` is 'a'**
