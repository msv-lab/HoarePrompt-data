According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. For the loop to execute, `digits` must contain at least 1 element. The variable `digit` will take the value of each element in `digits` during the iterations. Since `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, it does not affect the execution of the loop directly but indicates the size of the `cube_faces` and `used_cubes` lists.

To ensure the loop executes, we need to confirm that `digits` is not empty. Assuming `digits` has at least one string representation of a digit, `digit` would be initialized to the first element in `digits`.

State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `digits` is a list of string representations of the digits in num with at least 1 element, `used_cubes` is a list of n `False` values, `digit` is the first element in `digits`**
