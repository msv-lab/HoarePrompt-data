According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the number of elements in the `digits` list and the current state of `digit`. For the loop to execute again, there must be at least one more element in the `digits` list beyond the current iteration.

Let's consider the states provided:
1. If `n` is at least 1 and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[0]`, `used_cubes[0]` is True and `found` is True, resulting in the function returning False, which means the loop would not execute again. 
2. If `digit` is not found in `cube_faces[0]`, then we can assume `used_cubes[0]` remains False and `found` remains unchanged.
3. If the loop has executed a second time and `used_cubes[1]` is False, and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[1]`, then `used_cubes[1]` becomes True and `found` becomes True. 
4. If `n` is at least 3 and has executed a third time with `used_cubes[2]` False, and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[2]`, then `used_cubes[2]` becomes True and `found` becomes True.

Given the context, to execute the loop one more time:
- We need `digits` to have at least one more element than currently processed.
- Thus, if the current index of processing is 2 (for the third element), we need to ensure `digits` has at least 4 elements for the loop to execute once more.

Therefore, the adjusted state should reflect these conditions.

State: **`n` is at least 4, `used_cubes` contains True values for indices where digits were found, and `found` remains unchanged.**
