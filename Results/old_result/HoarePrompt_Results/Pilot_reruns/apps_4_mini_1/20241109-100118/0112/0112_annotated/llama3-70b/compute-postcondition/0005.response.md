According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. If `cubes` contains at least 2 lists, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `cubes` contains at least 1 list, `cube` is the first list in `cubes`, and `n` is between 1 and 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `cubes` must contain at least 2 lists and `cube` should refer to the second list in `cubes`. 

State: **`n` is between 1 and 3, `cubes` contains at least 2 lists, `cube` is the second list in `cubes`, `digits` now contains string representations of the digits in `cube`**
