The function accepts an integer `num`, along with the integer `n` (expected to be between 1 and 3) and a list `cube_faces` (not shown in the code snippet, but expected to be a list of lists containing digits). It checks if all digits in `num` can be matched to the elements in `cube_faces` without reusing any cube face. If all digits can be matched, it returns `True`; otherwise, it returns `False`. Notably, if `n` is less than or equal to 0, the function does not perform any checks and will incorrectly return `True`. This is an edge case that should return `False` instead, as no digits can be matched if there are no cube faces. Additionally, the function's logic assumes `cube_faces` has been defined and is valid, which is not enforced in the code.
