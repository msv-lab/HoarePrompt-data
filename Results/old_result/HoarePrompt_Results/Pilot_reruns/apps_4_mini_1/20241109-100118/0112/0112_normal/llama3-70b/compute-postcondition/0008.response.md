The `digits` variable is updated to include string representations of each integer in `cube`. Since `cube` is the next element in `cubes`, the contents of `cube` will determine what is added to `digits`. The previous state of `digits` is also taken into account as it will now include both its previous contents and the new string representations from `cube`. Therefore, the output state reflects that `digits` has been updated accordingly.

Output State: **`digits` is updated with string representations of each integer in `cube`**
