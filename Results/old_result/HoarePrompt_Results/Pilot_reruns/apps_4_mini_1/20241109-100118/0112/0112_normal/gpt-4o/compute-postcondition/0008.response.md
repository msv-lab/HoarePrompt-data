Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `n` ≤ 3, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists containing 6 integers each, `digits` is a list of characters from the string representation of `num` with at least 1 character, and `digit` is the first character in `digits`. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is found in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the conditions are not met, `found` remains False, and `used_cubes[i]` remains unchanged.***
