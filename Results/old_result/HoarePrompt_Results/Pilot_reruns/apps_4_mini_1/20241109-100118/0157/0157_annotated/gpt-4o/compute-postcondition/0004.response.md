`total_fruits` is assigned the value of `max_lemons * 1 + max_lemons * 2 + max_lemons * 4`. This can be simplified to `total_fruits = max_lemons * (1 + 2 + 4)` which equals `total_fruits = max_lemons * 7`. The variable `max_lemons` is calculated as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, but since specific values for `a`, `b`, and `c` are not provided, the exact numerical value of `total_fruits` cannot be determined. However, it is specified that `max_lemons` is dependent on the inputs `a`, `b`, and `c`. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between `total_fruits` and `max_lemons`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000; `max_lemons` is assigned the value min(`a`, `b // 2`, `c // 4`); `total_fruits` is equal to `max_lemons * 7`**
