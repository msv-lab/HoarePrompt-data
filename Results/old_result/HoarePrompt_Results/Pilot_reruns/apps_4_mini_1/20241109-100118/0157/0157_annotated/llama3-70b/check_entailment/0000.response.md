To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description and the annotations, let's analyze both carefully.

### Problem Description:
Nikolay wants to cook a compote using lemons, apples, and pears in a specific ratio: 
- For every 1 lemon, he needs exactly 2 apples and 4 pears. 

The task is to determine the maximum total number of fruits (lemons + apples + pears) that can be used while satisfying this ratio. 

### Expected Output:
1. If he has insufficient fruits to meet the ratio requirements, the output should be `0`.
2. If he can use some fruits, the output should be the total number of fruits used based on the maximum lemons he can use given the constraints.

### Annotations and Code Analysis:
1. The function reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` (for lemons, apples, and pears respectively).
2. It calculates `min_lemon` as `min(a, b // 2, c // 4)`, which determines the maximum number of lemons that can be used based on the available apples and pears.
3. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits used as `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`, which simplifies to `min_lemon * 7`.

### Example Analysis:
- **Example 1:** 
  - Input: `2`, `5`, `7`
  - Calculation: 
    - `min_lemon = min(2, 5 // 2, 7 // 4) = min(2, 2, 1) = 1`
    - Output: `1 + 2 + 4 = 7` (correct)
  
- **Example 2:** 
  - Input: `4`, `7`, `13`
  - Calculation: 
    - `min_lemon = min(4, 7 // 2, 13 // 4) = min(4, 3, 3) = 3`
    - Output: `3 + 6 + 12 = 21` (correct)

- **Example 3:** 
  - Input: `2`, `3`, `2`
  - Calculation:
    - `min_lemon = min(2, 3 // 2, 2 // 4) = min(2, 1, 0) = 0`
    - Output: `0` (correct)

### Edge Cases:
- The code handles cases where some fruits are insufficient to meet the ratio, returning `0` as expected.

### Conclusion:
The code correctly implements the logic required to solve the problem as described. All tested inputs, including edge cases, yield the expected outputs. 

Therefore, there are no scenarios where the program fails to meet the requirements set out in the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
