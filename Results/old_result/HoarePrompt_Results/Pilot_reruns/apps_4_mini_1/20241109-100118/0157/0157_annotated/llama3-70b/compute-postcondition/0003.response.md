The variable `min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, so their specific values will determine the outcome. 

Since `b // 2` is calculated by performing integer division of `b` by 2, and `c // 4` is determined by integer division of `c` by 4, we do not know their exact values. Therefore, the output state reflects the original values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the calculated value of `min_lemon`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is min(a, b // 2, c // 4)**
