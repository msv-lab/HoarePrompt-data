The variable `max_lemons` is assigned the value of the minimum among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, and since `c` is constrained to be between 1 and 1000, `c // 4` will yield an integer value from 0 to 250. The values of `a` and `b // 2` depend on the input given for `a` and `b`. The output state reflects the values of all three variables and indicates the new value assigned to `max_lemons`.

Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ `c` ≤ 1000; `max_lemons` is assigned the value min(`a`, `b // 2`, `c // 4`)**
