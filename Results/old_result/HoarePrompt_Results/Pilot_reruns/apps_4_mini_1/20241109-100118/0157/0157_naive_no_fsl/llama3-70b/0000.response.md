Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly calculates the maximum total number of fruits Nikolay can use to make the compote based on the given constraints. 

### Explanation:
1. The program first reads the number of lemons (`a`), apples (`b`), and pears (`c`) from input.
2. It then computes the maximum number of lemons that can be used in the compote by determining the minimum of:
   - The number of lemons available (`a`).
   - Half the number of apples available (`b // 2`) since each lemon requires 2 apples.
   - A quarter of the number of pears available (`c // 4`) since each lemon requires 4 pears.
3. The variable `min_lemon` stores this minimum value, which represents the maximum number of lemons that can be used.
4. Finally, it calculates the total number of fruits used in the compote by summing `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4` (which accounts for the lemons, apples, and pears used respectively) and prints the result.

### Edge Cases:
- If any of the fruit counts are insufficient to make at least one complete set of fruits in the ratio of 1:2:4, the program correctly computes the result as `0`. For example, if there are 2 lemons, 3 apples, and 2 pears, the calculation of `min_lemon` will yield `0`, since `c // 4` would yield `0`.

- The program adheres to the problem constraints (positive integers between 1 and 1000) and handles the maximum limits well.

Since I cannot find any case where the program fails to meet the problem requirements, I conclude that the program is correct.
