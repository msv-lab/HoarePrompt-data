Functionality: ** The function accepts three integer inputs from the user: `a`, `b`, and `c`. It calculates the minimum value among `a`, half of `b`, and a quarter of `c`, referred to as `min_lemon`. The function then outputs the value of `7 * min_lemon`. However, since there are no checks for valid input outside of expected integer values, it may raise an error if the input is not convertible to an integer or if inputs are outside the assumed range, though it is presumed from the comments that valid inputs will be provided. The function does not handle any exceptions or provide any return values, only printing the result directly.**
