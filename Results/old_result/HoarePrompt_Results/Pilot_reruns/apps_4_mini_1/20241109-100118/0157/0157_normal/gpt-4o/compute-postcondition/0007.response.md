Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input. It calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be produced based on the constraints of available fruits: `a` lemons, half of `b` fruits, and a quarter of `c` fruits. It then computes the total number of fruits produced based on the maximum number of lemons, which is calculated as `7 * max_lemons`. Finally, it prints the total fruits produced. The function does not return any values. **
