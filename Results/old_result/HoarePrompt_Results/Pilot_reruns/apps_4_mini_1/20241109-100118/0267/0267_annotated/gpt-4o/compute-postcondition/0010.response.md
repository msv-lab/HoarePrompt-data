According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `r`. The loop is set to iterate from `l` to `r`, inclusive. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is equal to `l + 2`. For the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be less than or equal to `r`.

Given that `num` is currently `l + 2`, for the loop to execute again, `l + 2` must be less than or equal to `r`. Therefore, we can conclude that the state of `r` needs to be adjusted to ensure that `num` can take on the next value in the sequence, which would be `l + 3`.

Since `num` should be updated to `l + 3` for the next iteration, we need to set the conditions that ensure this. Specifically, `r` must be at least `l + 3` for the loop to continue.

State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` and `r` are integers such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, and `num` is equal to `l + 3` with `r` being at least `l + 3**.
