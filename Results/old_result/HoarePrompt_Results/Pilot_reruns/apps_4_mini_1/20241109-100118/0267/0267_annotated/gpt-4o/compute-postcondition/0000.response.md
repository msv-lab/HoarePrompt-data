The code initializes `total_sum` to 0. The values of `l`, `r`, and `k` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the initial values of these variables along with the updated value of `total_sum`.

Output State: **`l` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `r` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `l` ≤ `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ `k` ≤ 10, and `total_sum` is 0**
