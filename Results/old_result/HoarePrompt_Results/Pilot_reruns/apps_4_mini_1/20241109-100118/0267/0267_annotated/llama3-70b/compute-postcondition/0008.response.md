According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 1 to `k - 1`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `k - 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is currently `k - 2` since the loop starts at 1 and increments `i` until it reaches `k - 1`. 

Since `k` is greater than 1, `k - 1` must be at least 1, which means the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `k - 1`. Therefore, the state of `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 2 + 1`, which is `k - 1`. Thus, `i` must be equal to `k - 1` at the start of the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted since `l` and `r` remain unchanged and valid.

State: **`l` is an integer such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, `r` is an integer such that `1 <= l <= r < 10^18`, `k` is greater than 1, `dp[n, k]` is `9 * 10`, `i` is `k - 1`**
