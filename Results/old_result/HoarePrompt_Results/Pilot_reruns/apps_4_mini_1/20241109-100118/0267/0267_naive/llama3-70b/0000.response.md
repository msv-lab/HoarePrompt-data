To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, let's analyze the key requirements and the logic of the code.

### Problem Requirements:
1. Calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` (inclusive) such that each number contains at most `k` different digits.
2. The output should be the sum modulo `998244353`.

### Program Analysis:
The function `func_1(l, r, k)` appears to rely on a helper function `count(n, k, dp)` to compute the sum of valid numbers up to `n`. Here are the important points to consider:

1. **Base Cases**: The helper function handles cases where `k == 0`, and if `n` is less than `10 ** k`, it simply returns `n`. This part seems reasonable, but we need to ensure it captures all valid numbers.

2. **Counting Valid Numbers**: 
   - The code seems to compute the number of valid numbers using dynamic programming and some mathematical formulations. However, it doesn't explicitly generate and validate each number from `l` to `r` to ensure they meet the criteria of having at most `k` different digits.
   - The approach relies on counting and formulas rather than direct iteration, which could lead to incorrect sums if edge cases are not handled.

3. **Potential Issue**:
   - For a specific example, consider `l = 100`, `r = 200`, and `k = 1`. The valid numbers would be `111`, `222`, etc., which all contain only one digit. The current implementation may not correctly identify all such numbers within the range since it executes based on conditions rather than checking each number directly.

### Example Case:
Let's consider the case where `l = 100`, `r = 200`, and `k = 1`. The expected valid numbers are:
- `111`
- `222`

However, the program might not properly count these numbers if its counting logic fails to enumerate numbers correctly based on the digit restriction.

### Conclusion:
Given that the program does not directly enumerate the numbers and may fail to properly account for all valid numbers in specific edge cases, it does not fulfill the problem requirements in every potential scenario.

Correctness: **False**.
