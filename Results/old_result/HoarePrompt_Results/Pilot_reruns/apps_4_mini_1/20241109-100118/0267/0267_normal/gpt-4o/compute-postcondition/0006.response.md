Postcondition: ***`l` is an integer such that 1 <= `l` <= `r`, `r` is an integer such that `l` <= `r` < 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 <= `k` <= 10, and `total_sum` is initially 0. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, `total_sum` is updated to `(0 + (l + 1)) % MOD`, where `num` is `l + 1`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns false, `total_sum` remains 0. This ensures that `total_sum` only reflects the contribution of `num` when the condition is satisfied, while remaining unchanged otherwise.***
