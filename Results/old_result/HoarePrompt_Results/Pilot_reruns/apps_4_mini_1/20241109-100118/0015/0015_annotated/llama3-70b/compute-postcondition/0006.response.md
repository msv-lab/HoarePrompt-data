Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values. If `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, then 'YES' is printed, indicating that the difference between `b` and `a` is a multiple of `c` and non-negative. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed, indicating that either the difference is not a multiple of `c` or is negative. This covers all cases, including when `c` is zero, which would result in a division by zero error if not handled separately.***
