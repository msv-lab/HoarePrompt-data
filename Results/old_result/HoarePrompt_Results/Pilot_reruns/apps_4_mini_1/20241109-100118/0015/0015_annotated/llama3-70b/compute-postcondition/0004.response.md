The code executes a print statement that outputs the string 'YES'. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state includes the current values of `a`, `b`, and `c`, along with the indication that 'YES' has been printed.

Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers assigned from input values, and 'YES' has been printed**
