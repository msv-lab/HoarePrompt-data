Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9. If `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`, then 'YES' is printed, indicating that the difference between `b` and `a` is a multiple of `c` and non-negative. If either condition is not met, 'NO' is printed, indicating that either the difference is not a multiple of `c` or it is negative.***
