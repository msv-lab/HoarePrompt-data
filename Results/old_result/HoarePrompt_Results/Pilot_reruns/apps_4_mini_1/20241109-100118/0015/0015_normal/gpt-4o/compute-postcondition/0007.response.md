Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `c` are integers such that -10^9 ≤ `a`, `b`, `c` ≤ 10^9. If `b` is equal to `a`, the output is 'YES'. If `c` is equal to 0, the output is 'NO'. If `c` is not zero and the difference `(b - a)` is a multiple of `c` and non-negative, then the output is 'YES'. Otherwise, the output is 'NO', indicating that either `c` is zero, the difference is not a multiple of `c`, or the result of `(b - a) / c` is negative. Additionally, if `b` is less than `a` and `c` is positive, or if `b` is greater than `a` and `c` is negative, 'NO' will be printed due to the sign mismatch.**
