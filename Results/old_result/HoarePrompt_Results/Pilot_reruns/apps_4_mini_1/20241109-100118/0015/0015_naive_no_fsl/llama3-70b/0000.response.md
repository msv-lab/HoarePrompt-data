Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to determine if Vasya's favorite integer `b` appears in the sequence defined by the first element `a` and the common difference `c`. Hereâ€™s how it works:

1. **When `c == 0`:** 
   - The sequence is constant (all elements are equal to `a`). 
   - The program checks if `a` is equal to `b`. If they are equal, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO". This correctly handles cases where the sequence does not change.

2. **When `c != 0`:**
   - The program checks if `(b - a) % c == 0`, which verifies if `b` can be reached from `a` using steps of size `c`. This ensures that `b` can be expressed as `a + k * c` for some integer `k`.
   - The condition `(b - a) / c >= 0` ensures that `k` is a non-negative integer, which is necessary because `i` must be a positive integer for the sequence terms.

The program covers the possibilities outlined in the problem statement, including:
- When the sequence does not progress (i.e., when `c` is zero).
- When `b` is less than `a` and `c` is positive (the sequence increases).
- When `b` is less than `a` and `c` is negative (the sequence decreases).

Given that it successfully handles all specified scenarios and edge cases, I conclude the program is correct.
