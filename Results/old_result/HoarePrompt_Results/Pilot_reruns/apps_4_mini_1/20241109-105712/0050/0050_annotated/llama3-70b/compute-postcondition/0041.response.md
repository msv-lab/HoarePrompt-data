The function `func` does not have any parameters directly passed to it in its definition. However, it relies on the following inputs based on the provided constraints:

1. `n` - a positive integer such that \(1 \leq n \leq 30\).
2. `m` - a positive integer such that \(1 \leq m \leq 30\).
3. `r` - a positive integer such that \(1 \leq r \leq 1000\).
4. `s` - a list of integers representing the prices of shares, where each price is between 1 and 1000.
5. `b` - a list of integers representing the selling prices of shares, where each price is between 1 and 1000.

The function's output is not explicitly defined in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot describe the exact return value of the function. 

Functionality: **The function accepts five inputs: positive integers `n`, `m`, and `r`, and lists of integers `s` and `b`, representing share prices and selling prices respectively. The exact return value based on these inputs is not specified.**
