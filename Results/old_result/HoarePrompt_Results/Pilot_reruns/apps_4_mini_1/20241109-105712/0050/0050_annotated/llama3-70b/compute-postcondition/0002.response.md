The variable `b` is assigned the value of a list created by mapping the `int` function over input values obtained via `input().split()`. The initial state specifies `s` as a list of integers based on user input, but it does not affect the assignment to `b`. The value of `b` will reflect the user input as a list of integers.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 30; `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 30; `r` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000; `s` is a list of integers based on user input; `b` is a list of integers based on user input.**
