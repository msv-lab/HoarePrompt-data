The code takes input as a space-separated string of integers, splits this string, and then maps each split string to an integer before converting it into a list. The variable `s` will hold this list of integers. However, the previous values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected directly by this operation. The value of `s` depends on the input provided, which is unknown at this stage. Therefore, the output state indicates that `s` is a list of integers based on user input, while `n`, `m`, and `r` remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 30; `m` is a positive integer between 1 and 30; `r` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000; `s` is a list of integers based on user input.**
