Functionality: ** The function accepts three integers: `n` (the number of buy prices), `m` (the number of sell prices), and `r` (the available budget). It reads two lists of integers representing the buy prices (`s`) and sell prices (`b`). If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints `r`, indicating no profitable transaction is possible. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the budget at the minimum buy price, computes the remaining budget after purchasing those shares, and then calculates the total amount of money by selling those shares at the maximum sell price. Finally, it prints the total amount of money that can be obtained. The function assumes valid input and does not handle any input errors or edge cases such as empty lists or invalid data types. **
