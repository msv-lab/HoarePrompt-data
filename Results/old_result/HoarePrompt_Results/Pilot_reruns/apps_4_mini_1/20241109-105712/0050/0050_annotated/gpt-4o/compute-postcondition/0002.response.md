The value of `b` is assigned the result of `list(map(int, input().split()))`, which takes a line of input, splits it into individual string elements, converts each element to an integer, and then creates a list from these integers. The variables `n`, `m`, `r`, and `s` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of input integers representing buy prices; `b` is a list of input integers.

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned values from input; `s` is a list of input integers representing buy prices; `b` is a list of input integers**
