Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are assigned values from input, `s` is a sorted list of integers from user input, `b` is a sorted list of integers from user input in descending order. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is updated to `shares + (r // s[i])`, and `r` is updated to `r % s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop is exited, leaving `shares` unchanged and `r` at its current value. This means that if `r` is not sufficient to cover `s[i]`, no further shares can be calculated, and the program breaks out of the loop.***
