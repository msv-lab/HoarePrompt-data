The function `func` accepts the following parameters: `n` and `m`, which are integers constrained to the range 1 to 30; `r`, which is an integer constrained to the range 1 to 1000; `s`, which is a list of `n` integers where each integer `s_i` is constrained to the range 1 to 1000; and `b`, which is a list of `m` integers where each integer `b_i` is also constrained to the range 1 to 1000. 

The function's output is not specified in the provided information, so we cannot ascertain the exact return value based on the given constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters n, m, r, s, and b, where n and m are integers between 1 and 30, r is an integer between 1 and 1000, s is a list of n integers each between 1 and 1000, and b is a list of m integers each between 1 and 1000. The return value is not specified.**
