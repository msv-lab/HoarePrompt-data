Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representation of a non-negative integer (which is '0' if initially empty), and `b` is a string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros (which is '0' if initially empty). The program prints '<' if the length of `a` is less than the length of `b`, '>' if the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, '<' if `a` is less than `b`, '>' if `a` is greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. This covers all cases, including scenarios where both `a` and `b` may be empty or consist of the value '0'.***
