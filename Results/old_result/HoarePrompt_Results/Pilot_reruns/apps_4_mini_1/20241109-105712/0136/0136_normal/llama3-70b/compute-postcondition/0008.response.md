Functionality: ** The function accepts two non-negative integer strings from user input, removes any leading zeroes, and then compares the two strings lexicographically. It prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if the first string is lexicographically less than the second, and '>' if the first string is greater than the second. The function does not return any value; it only prints the comparison result. **
