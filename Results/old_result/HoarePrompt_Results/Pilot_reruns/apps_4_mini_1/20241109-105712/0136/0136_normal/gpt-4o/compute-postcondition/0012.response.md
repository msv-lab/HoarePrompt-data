Postcondition: ***`a` is a string representation of a non-negative integer, which is '0' if it was initially empty. `b` is a string representation of a non-negative integer without leading zeros; if `b` is empty, it is updated to '0'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. Otherwise, the program prints '='. This accounts for all cases, including scenarios where both `a` and `b` are empty or equal.***
