The code assigns the value of `data[0]` after removing any leading zeros using the `lstrip('0')` method. The previous value of `data[0]` is a string that may contain leading zeroes, and after applying `lstrip('0')`, the result will be a string representation of the non-negative integer without those leading zeros. If `data[0]` only contains zeros, it will become an empty string. The other variables remain unaffected. 

Output State: **`a` is the string representation of the non-negative integer from `data[0]` without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string, and `data` is a list containing the input strings split by whitespace.**
