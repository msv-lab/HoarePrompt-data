Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are strings with leading zeroes removed. If `a` is equal to `b`, an equal sign '=' is printed. If `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the output is '<'. Otherwise, the output is '>', which covers the case when `a` is greater than `b`. All cases where `a` and `b` are equal or different are considered, ensuring that the comparison respects the lexicographical order of the strings.***
