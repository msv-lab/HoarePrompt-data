Postcondition: ***`a` is the input string without leading zeros, and `b` is the input string after removing leading zeros. If `a` is equal to `b`, the output will print '='; if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the output will print '<'; otherwise, the output will print '>'. This covers all cases, including scenarios where `a` and `b` are equal or when `b` has leading zeros removed, ensuring a comprehensive comparison of the strings.***
