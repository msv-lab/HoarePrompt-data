Postcondition: ***`a` is the input string without leading zeros and `b` is the input string after removing leading zeros. If `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, the output is '<'. Otherwise, the output is '>'. This handles all cases, including when `a` and `b` are equal, in which case the output implicitly indicates that '>' would be printed.***
