The function reads two non-negative integers as strings from user input, removes any leading zeroes, and compares them. It prints '<' if the first number is less than the second, '>' if it is greater, and '=' if they are equal. If either input is empty, it is treated as '0'. All edge cases regarding leading zeroes and empty inputs are handled.
