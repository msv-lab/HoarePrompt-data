You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two very long integers a, b (leading zeroes are allowed). You should check what number a or b is greater or determine that they are equal.

The input size is very large so don't use the reading of symbols one by one. Instead of that use the reading of a whole line or token.

As input/output can reach huge size it is recommended to use fast input/output methods: for example, prefer to use scanf/printf instead of cin/cout in C++, prefer to use BufferedReader/PrintWriter instead of Scanner/System.out in Java. Don't use the function input() in Python2 instead of it use the function raw_input().


-----Input-----

The first line contains a non-negative integer a.

The second line contains a non-negative integer b.

The numbers a, b may contain leading zeroes. Each of them contains no more than 10^6 digits.


-----Output-----

Print the symbol "<" if a < b and the symbol ">" if a > b. If the numbers are equal print the symbol "=".

The function outputs '<' if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, '>' if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are compared as strings, and the `data` remains unchanged throughout.

The program prints '>' if the length of `a` is greater than the length of `b`, '<' if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, '>' if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are compared as strings, and the `data` remains unchanged throughout. All edge cases regarding empty strings and leading zeroes have been addressed.
    #State of the program after the else part has been executed: *`a` is the string value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, or '0' if `a` is empty. `b` is '0' if initially empty, or retains its original string value without leading zeroes.

    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`a` is the string value of `data[0]` without leading zeroes, or '0' if `a` is empty. `b` is '0' if initially empty, or retains its original string value without leading zeroes. The program compares the lengths of `a` and `b`, and if `a` has a shorter length, it prints '<'; if `a` has a greater length, it prints '>'; if both have equal lengths, it prints '<' if `a` is lexicographically less than `b`, '>' if `a` is lexicographically greater than `b`, and '=' if `a` is equal to `b`. The values of `a` and `b` are compared as strings, and the `data` remains unchanged throughout. All edge cases regarding empty strings and leading zeroes have been addressed.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function reads two non-negative integers as strings from user input, removes any leading zeroes, and compares them. It prints '<' if the first number is less than the second, '>' if it is greater, and '=' if they are equal. If either input is empty, it is treated as '0'. All edge cases regarding leading zeroes and empty inputs are handled.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
