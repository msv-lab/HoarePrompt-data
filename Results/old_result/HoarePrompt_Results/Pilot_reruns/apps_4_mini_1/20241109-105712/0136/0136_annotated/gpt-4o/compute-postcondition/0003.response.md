The value of `a` is assigned the string value '0', which overwrites its previous value. The values of `b` and `data` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is '0'; `b` is the string value of `data[1]` without leading zeroes; `data` is unchanged.

Output State: **`a` is '0'; `b` is the string value of `data[1]` without leading zeroes; `data` is unchanged.**
