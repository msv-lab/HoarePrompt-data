To determine the correctness of the provided program against the problem description, we need to analyze it step by step.

### Problem Analysis:
The task is to compute the probability that at least two out of `k` people share the same birthday, given that there are `2^n` days in a year. The result should be returned as an irreducible fraction `A/B`, where both `A` and `B` are coprime integers, and their values are taken modulo \(10^6 + 3\).

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(n, k):
    total_days = 2 ** n
    numerator = 1
    denominator = 1
    for i in range(k):
        numerator *= total_days - i
        denominator *= total_days
    gcd = math.gcd(numerator, denominator)
    numerator //= gcd
    denominator //= gcd
    return (numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3), denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3))

(n, k) = map(int, input().split())
(A, B) = func_1(n, k)
print(A, B)
```

### Analysis of the Program:
1. **Understanding the Loop**:
   - The program calculates the numerator and denominator of the probability in a loop that iterates `k` times.
   - The numerator is calculated as the product of available days minus the number of people already accounted for (`total_days - i`).
   - The denominator is simply `total_days` raised to the power of `k`.

2. **GCD Calculation**:
   - The program computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the numerator and denominator to simplify the fraction.

3. **Handling Edge Cases**:
   - The program uses `2 ** n`, which could potentially lead to very large numbers, especially since `n` can be as high as \(10^{18}\).
   - However, the program does not check if `k` exceeds `total_days` (i.e., if `k > 2^n`). In this case, it is guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday, and thus the output should be `1 1`.

4. **Potential Issues**:
   - If `k > total_days`, the program will incorrectly compute the probability using the formulas established, leading to incorrect values for `A` and `B`.
   - The program does not handle the edge case where `k` is greater than `2^n`. For example, if `n = 1` and `k = 3`, the output should be `1 1`, but the current logic could yield an incorrect result.

### Conclusion:
Given the analysis, the program does not correctly handle the case when `k` exceeds `2^n`. Therefore, the correctness of the program is:

Correctness: **False**.

**Counterexample**: For the input `1 3`, where `n = 1` (thus `2^n = 2`), the expected output is `1 1` as it's guaranteed that at least two people will share a birthday. However, the program would attempt to calculate a probability, leading to an incorrect result.
