The value of `denominator` is updated by multiplying it with `total_days`. The previous value of `denominator` is 1, and `total_days` is 2, so `denominator` becomes 1 * 2 = 2. The other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is 2, `numerator` is 2, `denominator` is 2, `i` is 0**
