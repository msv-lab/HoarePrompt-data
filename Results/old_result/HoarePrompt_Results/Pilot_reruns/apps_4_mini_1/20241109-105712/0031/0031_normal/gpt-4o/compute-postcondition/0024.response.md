To determine the output state after executing the provided code, we will analyze the variables and their interactions step by step.

1. **Initial State Analysis**:
   - `p_no_shared` is the value of `numerator`.
   - `p_total` is the value of `denominator`.
   - `p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`.
   - `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`.
   - `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.
   - `g` is assigned the result of `func_1(A, B)`.

2. **Code Execution**:
   - The statement `A //= g` performs an integer division of `A` by `g`, updating the value of `A`.

3. **Impact on Variables**:
   - The value of `A` is changed (updated) by performing integer division with `g`.
   - The values of `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, `p_shared`, `B`, and `g` remain unchanged during this operation.

4. **Output State Construction**:
   - We need to express the final state of the variables. `A` will now hold a new value which is the result of `A // g`, but we do not know the specific numerical values of `A` or `g` after their respective assignments (as they depend on the inputs to `func_1` and the initial values of `numerator` and `denominator`).

Thus, we summarize the final state:

Output State: **`p_no_shared` is the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated as (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, `A` is the result of (previous value of `p_shared // g`), `B` is the value of `p_total`, and `g` is the result of func_1(A, B)**.
