The `numerator` is assigned the value of `numerator // gcd`. Given that `numerator` is 1 and `gcd` is also 1, the calculation results in `numerator` becoming 1 // 1, which is 1. The states of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `k` is less than 2, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, and `gcd` is 1.

Output State: **`k` is less than 2, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `gcd` is 1**
