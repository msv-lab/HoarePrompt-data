The task requires verifying whether the provided Python program meets the specifications outlined in the problem description regarding the Birthday Paradox and its associated calculations.

### Initial Assessment
The program is intended to compute the probability that at least two out of `k` people have the same birthday, given that there are `2^n` days in a year. The output should be in the form of an irreducible fraction \( \frac{A}{B} \).

The code defines a function `func_1(n, k)` that calculates:
- The total number of days as \( 2^n \).
- A numerator and denominator based on the number of people \( k \).

However, there are some potential issues:
1. The function does not handle the scenario where \( k \) is greater than \( 2^n \) correctly. According to the Birthday Paradox, if \( k \) exceeds the number of days, the probability of at least two people sharing a birthday is certain (i.e., \( \frac{1}{1} \)).
2. The loop iterates \( k \) times, which could lead to an overflow or very large numbers given the constraints of \( k \) and \( n \).

### Review of Output Hints
The output hints indicate that:
- The function accepts parameters \( n \) and \( k \).
- It calculates a fraction based on \( k \).
- It explicitly states that if \( k \) is less than 2, the return should be (1, 1), which aligns with the problem description.

However, the hints also suggest that the logic for \( k \geq 2 \) is not implemented correctly, which is a significant concern as it directly impacts the correctness of the solution.

### Conclusion
The program does not accurately handle all cases outlined in the problem description. Specifically:
- It fails to account for cases where \( k \) is greater than \( 2^n \).
- The calculation logic does not handle edge cases appropriately.

Given that there are potential inputs (e.g., \( n = 1, k = 3 \)) where the code will not return the correct results, the overall correctness of the program can be deemed false.

Correctness: **False**.
