The value of `total_days` is assigned the value `2 ** n`, which is 2 raised to the power of `n`. The value of `n` can be any integer between 1 and 10^18, so `total_days` will be a very large integer depending on the specific value of `n`. The value of `k` is not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, and `total_days` is equal to `2 ** n`.

Output State: **`n` is an integer between 1 and 10^18, `k` is an integer between 2 and 10^18, `total_days` is equal to `2 ** n`**
