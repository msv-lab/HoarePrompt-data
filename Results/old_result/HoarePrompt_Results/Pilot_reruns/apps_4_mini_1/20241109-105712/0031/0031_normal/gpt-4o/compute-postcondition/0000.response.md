The code assigns the value of `10 ** 6 + 3` to the variable `MOD`. This operation does not affect the values of `n` and `k`, which remain as integers within the specified bounds. The calculation for `MOD` results in a value of `1000003`. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`, and `MOD` is 1000003.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18`, `k` is an integer such that `2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18`, and `MOD` is 1000003**
