Output State: **`numerator` is the product of `(total_days - i)` for `i` ranging from `0` to `k-1`; `denominator` is now `denominator` divided by `gcd`; `total_days` is `2^n`; `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`; the function returns `numerator % (10 ** 6 + 3)` and `denominator % (10 ** 6 + 3)`.**
