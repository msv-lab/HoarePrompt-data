The code executes a print statement with the values `1` and `1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `MOD` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects that the print operation outputs the specified values while the state of the other variables remains unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `MOD` is 1000003, and the output is 1 1**
