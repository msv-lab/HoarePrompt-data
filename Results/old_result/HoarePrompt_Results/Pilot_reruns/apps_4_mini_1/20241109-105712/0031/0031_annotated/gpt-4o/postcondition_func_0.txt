The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`. It computes the greatest common divisor (GCD) of `a` and `b` using the Euclidean algorithm, but only if `b` is greater than 0. If `b` is less than or equal to 0, the function returns `a` unchanged. Therefore, if `b` is non-positive, the function does not perform a GCD computation and simply returns the value of `a`.
