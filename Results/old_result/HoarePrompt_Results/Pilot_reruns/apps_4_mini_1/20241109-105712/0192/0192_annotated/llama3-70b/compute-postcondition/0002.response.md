The function `func` does not accept any parameters. However, it operates on two integer values, `x` and `y`, which must satisfy the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function's output has not been specified in the provided information. Therefore, we cannot determine the exact return value or its conditions. 

Functionality: **The function does not accept any parameters, but it operates on two integers x and y with the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The return value is not specified.**
