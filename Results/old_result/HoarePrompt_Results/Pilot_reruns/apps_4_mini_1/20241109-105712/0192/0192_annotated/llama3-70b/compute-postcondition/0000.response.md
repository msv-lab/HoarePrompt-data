The values of `x` and `y` are assigned based on the `input` which accepts two integers. However, the specific values of `x` and `y` after the execution depend on the input provided. The only constraints given are that `3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000`, which means after the execution, `x` and `y` will hold values that satisfy these conditions. Therefore, the output state reflects the conditions before the assignment.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000**
