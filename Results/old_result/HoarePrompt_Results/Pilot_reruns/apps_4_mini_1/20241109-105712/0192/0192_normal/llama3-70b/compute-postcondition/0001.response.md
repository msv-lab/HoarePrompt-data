The code prints the absolute difference between `x` and `y`. Given that `y` is less than `x`, the result of `abs(x - y)` is simply `x - y`. The values of `x` and `y` are input integers satisfying the condition 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the output will reflect the absolute difference calculated from those values.

Output State: **`x` and `y` are assigned input integers such that 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000, and the output is `x - y`**
