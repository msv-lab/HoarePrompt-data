The function accepts two integers `x` and `y` from user input, where 3 ≤ `y` < `x` ≤ 100,000. It calculates and prints a non-negative integer based on the formula `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`, which effectively computes the ceiling of half the difference between `x` and `y`. The function does not return a value; it only prints the result.
