The function `func` accepts two parameters: `x` and `y`. Both `x` and `y` are integers, with the constraints that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. However, the output of the function is not provided in the prompt. Therefore, based on the available information, I can only describe the parameters and their constraints.

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters, x and y, which are integers with the constraints 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The specific return value of the function is not described.**
