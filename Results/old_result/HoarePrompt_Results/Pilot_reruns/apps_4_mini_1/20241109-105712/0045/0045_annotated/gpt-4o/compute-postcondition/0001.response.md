The function returns `-1`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `min_sum` remain unchanged, as the return statement does not alter the state of these variables. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, and the function returns `-1`.

Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer, `min_sum` is calculated as k * (k + 1) // 2, and the function returns -1**
