Functionality: ** The function accepts two integers `a` and `b`, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of those two integers. If `b` is initially 0, the function will return `a` unchanged, which is consistent with the mathematical definition of GCD. The function handles both positive and zero values for `b`. **
