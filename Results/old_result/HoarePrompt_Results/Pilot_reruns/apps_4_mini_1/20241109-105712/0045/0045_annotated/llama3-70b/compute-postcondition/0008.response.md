The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `a` and `b`. Both `a` and `b` are positive integers. After executing the function body, `a` holds the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the original values of `a` and `b`. The function returns the value of `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `a` and `b`, compute their greatest common divisor, and return that divisor. 

Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters a and b, both positive integers, and returns the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b.**
