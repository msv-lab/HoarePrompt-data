Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `min_sum` is calculated as `k * (k + 1) // 2`, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`, and `remainder` is decreased by 1. The `sequence` is a list of size `k` containing the values `[(d * (i + 1)) for i in range(k)]`, with `sequence[-1]` increased by 1. If `remainder` is 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement; otherwise, the program continues execution with the current values of `n`, `k`, `min_sum`, `d`, `remainder`, and `sequence`. Additionally, if `remainder` is initially 0, it indicates that all necessary conditions have been met, and the loop is exited accordingly.***
