The value of `remainder` is decreased by 1. The values of `k`, `i`, and `sequence[i]` are not directly affected by this operation, but we note that `remainder` changes from its previous value to one less than before. Therefore, the output state reflects the change in `remainder` while maintaining the other variable states.

Output State: **`remainder` is decreased by 1, `k` is at least 2, `i` is 0, and `sequence[i]` is increased by 1**
