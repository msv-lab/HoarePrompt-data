The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `a` and `b`. Both parameters are related to the values of `n` and `k`, which are positive integers. The output of the function is determined by the value of `b`. If `b` is greater than 0, `a` is the last non-zero value of `b`; if `b` is 0, `a` remains the initial value of `n` (or `k`). The function ultimately returns the value of `a`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two parameters `a` and `b`, and return the last non-zero value of `b` if `b` is greater than 0, or the initial value of `n` (or `k`) if `b` is 0. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `a` and `b`, and returns `a` as the last non-zero value of `b` if `b` is greater than 0; otherwise, it returns the initial value of `n` (or `k` if `b` was 0).**
