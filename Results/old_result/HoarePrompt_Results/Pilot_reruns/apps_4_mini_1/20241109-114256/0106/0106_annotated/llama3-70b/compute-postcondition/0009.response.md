Postcondition: ***`a_block`, `b_floor`, and `b_block` are calculated based on the values of `a` and `b`, where `a_floor` and `b_floor` represent the respective floor values of `a` and `b`. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is determined by the difference multiplied by 5, plus 10. If `a_floor` is less than or equal to `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated similarly, reflecting the difference in the opposite order, ensuring that the calculation accounts for all possible scenarios between `a_floor` and `b_floor`. Additionally, `min_block_time` is computed based on the minimum of the absolute difference and `n` minus the absolute difference multiplied by 15, which provides a comprehensive measure of the time adjustments based on block values.***
