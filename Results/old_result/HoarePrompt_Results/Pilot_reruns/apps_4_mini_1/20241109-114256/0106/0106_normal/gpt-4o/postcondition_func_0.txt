The function accepts three positive integer parameters `n`, `m`, and `k` (where 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000) and two distinct integers `a` and `b` (where 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k). It calculates the time required to move from the location of `a` to the location of `b` by determining the exit time based on the floor of `a`, the minimum walking time between the blocks of `a` and `b`, and the time to reach the target floor of `b`. The total time returned accounts for all these factors, ensuring it reflects the movement dynamics accurately.
