The variable `reverse_walk_time` is assigned the value `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15`. The calculations involve the values of `block_a`, `block_b`, and `n`. The `abs(block_a - block_b)` calculates the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`. Since `block_a` and `block_b` are distinct integers, `abs(block_a - block_b)` will yield a positive integer. 

The expression `(n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n` ensures that the result remains within the range of `0` to `n-1`, and then it is multiplied by `15` to get the `reverse_walk_time`. 

Assuming `block_a` and `block_b` are such that their absolute difference is less than or equal to `n`, the value of `reverse_walk_time` will be calculated accordingly. Other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000; `a` and `b` are distinct integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k; `block_a` and `floor_a` are values from `get_location(a)`; `block_b` and `floor_b` are values from `get_location(b)`; `direct_walk_time` is calculated as `abs(block_a - block_b) % n * 15`; `reverse_walk_time` is (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15**.
