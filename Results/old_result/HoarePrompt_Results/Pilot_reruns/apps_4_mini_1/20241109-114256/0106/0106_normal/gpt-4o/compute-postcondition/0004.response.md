The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. `apartment` is a distinct integer representing an apartment number such that 1 ≤ apartment ≤ n·m·k. After executing the function body, it calculates two values: `block` and `floor`. The value of `block` is calculated as (apartment - 1) // (m * k) + 1, and the value of `floor` is calculated as (floor_within_block // k) + 1, where `floor_within_block` is derived from (apartment - 1) % (m * k). The function then returns `block` and `floor`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and return the corresponding `block` and `floor` within a specified building structure. 

Functionality: **The function accepts an integer apartment, and returns the corresponding block and floor of that apartment.**
