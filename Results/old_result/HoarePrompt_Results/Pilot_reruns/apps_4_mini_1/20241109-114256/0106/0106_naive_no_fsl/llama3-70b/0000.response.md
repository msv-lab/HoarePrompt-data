To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code step by step based on the problem description and the examples given.

1. **Input Parsing:**
   - The program reads three integers `n`, `m`, `k`, which represent the number of blocks, floors per block, and apartments per floor, respectively.
   - It also reads two integers `a` and `b`, which are the apartment numbers of Edward and Natasha.

2. **Calculating Floors and Blocks:**
   - The code calculates the floor and block (entrance) for both apartments:
     ```python
     a_floor = (a - 1) % m + 1
     a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1
     b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1
     ```
   - This part seems correct since it correctly determines the floor and block from the apartment number.

3. **Calculating Minimum Time to Transition Between Blocks:**
   - The time taken to transition between blocks is calculated:
     ```python
     min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15
     ```
   - This effectively calculates the time taken for Edward to walk around the building to Natasha's block, either clockwise or counterclockwise.

4. **Calculating Time to Move Between Floors:**
   - The code calculates the time taken to move between the floors:
     ```python
     if a_floor > b_floor:
         min_floor_time = (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10
     else:
         min_floor_time = (b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10
     ```
   - However, the time calculation here appears to be incorrect. The program adds an additional 10 seconds when `a_floor > b_floor`, which is not consistent with the problem description. The 10 seconds should only account for the lift waiting time, not for the stair movement.

5. **Output:**
   - Finally, it prints the total time:
     ```python
     print(min_block_time + min_floor_time)
     ```

### **Potential Issues:**

- The calculation for `min_floor_time` is flawed because it incorrectly adds 10 seconds to the time taken to move between floors. The lift takes 10 seconds to arrive, but when moving between floors using stairs, it should not include this waiting time.

### **Test Case to Highlight the Issue:**

Let's consider a case where Edward is on the highest floor and needs to go down to the first floor:

- Input: 
  ```
  2 3 4
  12 2
  ```
  - Here, Edward is in block 1 on floor 3 (apartment 12), and Natasha is in block 1 on floor 1 (apartment 2).
  - Expected time using stairs: 2 floors down (2 * 5 = 10 seconds).
  - Total block transition time (0 seconds since both are in block 1).
  - The program would output `10 + 10 = 20` seconds due to the incorrect logic for floor time.

### **Conclusion:**
Since there exists a case where the program does not function as expected according to the problem description due to incorrect handling of the `min_floor_time`, we conclude:

Correctness: **False**
