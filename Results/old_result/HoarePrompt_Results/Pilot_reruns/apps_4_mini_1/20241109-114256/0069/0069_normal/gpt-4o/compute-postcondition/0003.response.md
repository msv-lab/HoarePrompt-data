The value of `index` is assigned to 1. The value of `data` and `T` remain unchanged as they are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `data` is a list of strings obtained from input split by whitespace, `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, and `index` is 1.

Output State: **`data` is a list of strings obtained from input split by whitespace, `T` is the integer value of `data[0]`, and `index` is 1**
