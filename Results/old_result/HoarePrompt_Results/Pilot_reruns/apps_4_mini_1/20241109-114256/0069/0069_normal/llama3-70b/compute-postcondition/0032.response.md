Output State: **If `T` is greater than 0, the loop executes `T` times. After each iteration, `n` and `x` are derived from input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, and `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`. `balance` is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `balance` equals `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If `cnt0` is not equal to `cnt1` and `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. Special care is needed when `cnt0` equals `cnt1` to avoid division by zero. If `T` is 0, the loop does not execute, and no variables are assigned.**
