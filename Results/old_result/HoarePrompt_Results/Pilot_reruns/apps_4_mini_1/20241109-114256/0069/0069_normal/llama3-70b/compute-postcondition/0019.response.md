Postcondition: ***`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 1, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is divisible by `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`. Additionally, if `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, special handling may be required since division by zero could occur, and that case should be considered in the logic.***
