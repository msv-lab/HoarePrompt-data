Postcondition: ***If `_` is less than `T`, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on user input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which calculates the number of steps required to reach the target based on the balance of '0's and '1's. This condition also implicitly handles edge cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1`, leading to a division by zero; in such a scenario, if `(x - balance) % 0 == 0`, it would print -1.***
