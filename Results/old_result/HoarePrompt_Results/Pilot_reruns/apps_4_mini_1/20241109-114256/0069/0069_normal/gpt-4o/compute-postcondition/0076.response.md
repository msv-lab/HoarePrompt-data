According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop will iterate from 1 to `n`, inclusive. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, `i` will be `n + 1`. So for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than or equal to 1, and `i` will start at 1.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to 0s, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1**
