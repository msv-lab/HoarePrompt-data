The code appends `-1` to the list `results`. Since no previous values of `results` are provided, we can only state that `-1` is added. The initial state indicates that if `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` would be populated, but since the code snippet does not affect `prefix_balances`, we will only focus on `results`. 

Output State: **`prefix_balances` remains [0], `results` has -1 appended to it**
