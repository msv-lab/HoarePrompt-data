According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue to execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 2. Since `n` is at least 1, it will still allow the loop to execute again. 

Therefore, the necessary adjustments are:
- `i` should be updated to 2.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to 0s, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2**
