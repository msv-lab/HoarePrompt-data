The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value `prefix_balances[i - 1]`. The current string character `s[i - 1]` is checked: if it is '0', 1 is added; if it is '1', -1 is subtracted. The initial state indicates that `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, and `i` is initially 1. Therefore, after executing the code:

- `prefix_balances[i]` will be equal to `prefix_balances[0]` (which is 0) plus 1 if `s[0]` is '0', or minus 1 if `s[0]` is '1'.

Thus, the output state will reflect the updated value of `prefix_balances[1]` based on the character at `s[0]`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is updated at index 1 based on the value of `s[0]`; `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1**
