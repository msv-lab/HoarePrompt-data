According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `T`. Since `T` is a positive integer, the loop will execute as long as `T` is at least 1. At the end of the last iteration, the loop variable `_` will be equal to `T - 1`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `T` must be at least 1, and `_` should start at 0 for the first iteration. 

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `_` is 0**
