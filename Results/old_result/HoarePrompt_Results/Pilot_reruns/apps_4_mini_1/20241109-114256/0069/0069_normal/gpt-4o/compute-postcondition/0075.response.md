The variable `prefix_balances` is assigned a new list which is initialized to contain `0` values. The length of this list is `n + 1`, where `n` has been previously assigned the value `int(data[index])`. Other variables such as `results`, `T`, `x`, `s`, `index`, and `balance` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state reflects the new value of `prefix_balances` based on the value of `n`.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to 0s**
