According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 4, and `n` must be at least 4 to ensure that the condition `i <= n` holds true. Therefore, `n` needs to be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 4.

State: **`prefix_balances` at index 3 is updated based on `prefix_balances[2]` and the value of `s[2]`, `i` is 4, `n` is greater than or equal to 4**
