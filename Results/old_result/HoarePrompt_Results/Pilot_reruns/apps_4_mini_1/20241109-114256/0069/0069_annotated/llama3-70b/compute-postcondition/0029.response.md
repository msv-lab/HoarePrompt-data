Postcondition: ***`T` is `T - 1`, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, and `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`. If the difference `(x - balance)` is perfectly divisible by the difference `(cnt0 - cnt1)`, the function prints -1. Otherwise, the function prints the result of the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1`, which accounts for cases where `cnt0` equals `cnt1` leading to potential division by zero. In such cases, it's implied that the program should handle this scenario to avoid an error, potentially by checking if `cnt0` is equal to `cnt1` before performing the division.***
