Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer and is initially 1. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is incremented to 2. If these conditions are not met, `count` remains 1. Additionally, `prefix_balances` is a non-empty iterable with at least 2 elements, and `b` is the second element in `prefix_balances`.***
