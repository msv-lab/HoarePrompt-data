The value of `T` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is `T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^5), `x` is an integer (-10^9 ≤ x ≤ 10^9), and `s` is a binary string of length `n` consisting of characters '0' and '1'.
