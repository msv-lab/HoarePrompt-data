Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0 if `n` is 0 or less. If `balance` equals 0, and if `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`; if `x` is not present, 0 is appended to `results`. If `balance` is not 0, `count` is equal to the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, and `count` is appended to `results`. This covers all cases for various values of `balance` and the presence of `x` in `prefix_balances`.***
