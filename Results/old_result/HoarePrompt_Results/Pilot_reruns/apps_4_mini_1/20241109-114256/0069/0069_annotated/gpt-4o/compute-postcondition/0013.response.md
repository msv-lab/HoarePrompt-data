Output State: **`T` is a positive integer (1 <= T <= 100), `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is `int(data[2])`, `s` is the binary string from `data[3]`, `data` is a list of strings obtained from input, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` initialized to zeros, `i` is 1, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`.**
