According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list needs to have at least 4 elements. At the end of the last iteration, `results` has at least 3 elements, and `result` is the third element in `results`. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, `results` must have at least 4 elements, `result` should be the fourth element in the list, and the loop variable will now refer to that fourth element.

State: **`T` is greater than 0, `results` is a list with at least 4 elements, `result` is the fourth element in `results`**
