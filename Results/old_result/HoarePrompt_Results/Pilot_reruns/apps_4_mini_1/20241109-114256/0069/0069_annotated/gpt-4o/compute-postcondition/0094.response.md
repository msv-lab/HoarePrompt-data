According to the code, the loop iterates over the `prefix_balances` list. Since `prefix_balances` has a length of `n + 1`, it contains `n + 1` elements. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `b` takes on the next value in the list. 

At the end of the last iteration, `b` would have been the last element of the `prefix_balances` list. Given that the list has all elements as 0, `b` would be 0 in the last iteration. Thus, to execute the loop one more time, we need to ensure that the loop has not yet completed its iterations.

Since `b` is the current element being iterated over, we need to set `b` to the next index in the list, which would be `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`, and we also need to ensure that the iteration has not exceeded the length of the list.

Therefore, since the `prefix_balances` list has a length of `n + 1`, and `b` must be the next index, it is necessary to adjust the state to reflect that we are considering the next index, which would be `1` (the first index in the list) and `prefix_balances` still being a list of length `n + 1` with all elements as 0.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` with all elements as 0, `b` is the first element in the list (0)**
