Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` where each element is 0. If `x` is present in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to `results`. If `x` is not present in `prefix_balances`, 0 is appended to `results`. In the case where `n` is 0 or less, `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros, and the loop does not execute.***
