The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the value of `s[i - 1]`. Since `i` is 1, we look at `prefix_balances[1]`, which will be assigned the value of `prefix_balances[0] + (1 if s[0] == '0' else -1)`. Given that `prefix_balances` is initially filled with zeros, `prefix_balances[0]` is 0. The value of `s[0]` will determine whether we add 1 or subtract 1. Therefore, `prefix_balances[1]` will be either 1 (if `s[0]` is '0') or -1 (if `s[0]` is not '0'). The states of other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of length `n + 1` filled with zeros; `balance` is updated; `x` is assigned a value; `results` is unchanged; `_` is less than `T`; `n` is greater than or equal to 1; `s` is assigned a value; `index` is increased by 3; `i` is 1; `prefix_balances[1]` is either 1 or -1 depending on `s[0]`.**
