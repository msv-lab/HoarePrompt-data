The values of `n` and `x` are assigned the result of `map(int, input().split())`, where `input()` accepts a line of input and `split()` separates it into components. The previous values of `n` and `x` are now replaced by two integer values entered by the user. The other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer (1 ≤ T ≤ 100), `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is an input binary string of length `n`, `cnt0` is the count of '0's in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1's in `s`, `balance` is `cnt0 - cnt1`, `T` is incremented (T + 1).
