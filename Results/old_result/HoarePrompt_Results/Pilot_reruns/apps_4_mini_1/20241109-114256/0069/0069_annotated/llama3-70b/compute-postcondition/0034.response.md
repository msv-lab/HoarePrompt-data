Functionality: **The function accepts an integer T denoting the number of test cases, and for each test case, it takes two integers n and x, followed by a binary string s of length n. It calculates the difference between the counts of '0's and '1's in the string (balance) and determines how many additional operations are needed to make this balance equal to x. If the balance is already equal to x, it prints n + 1; if cnt0 equals cnt1 and the adjustment cannot be made, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the number of operations required to reach the desired balance. If T is 0, no output is produced.**
