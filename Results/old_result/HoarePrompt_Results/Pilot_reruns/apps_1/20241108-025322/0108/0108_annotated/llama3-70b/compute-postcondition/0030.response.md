Example Answer:
The `char` in `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the ASCII sequence, and this replacement only occurs once. The value of `char` is then concatenated to the previous value of `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is the previous value of `res` concatenated with the replaced `char`, and `char` is still in `s`.
Output State: **`res` is the previous value of `res` concatenated with the replaced `char`, and `char` is still in `s`**
