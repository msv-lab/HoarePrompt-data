Example Answer:
The value of `j` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `j` is unknown, so the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 4, `j` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 4, `j` is incremented by 1**
