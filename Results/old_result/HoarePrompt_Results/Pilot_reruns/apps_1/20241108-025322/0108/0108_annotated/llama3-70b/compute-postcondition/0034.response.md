According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the presence of `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is still in `s`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is the updated string after adding `char` to it, and `char` is still in `s`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`res` is the updated string after adding `char` to it, `char` is still in `s`**
