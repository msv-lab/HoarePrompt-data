The variable `target` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. Since `s` is not affected by the code snippet, the output state is: s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, target is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
Output State: **s is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, target is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'**
