Example Answer:
`res` will have `char` added to it. The contents of `char` are not given, so we cannot determine the exact value of `res`. The variable `s` will be modified accordingly by removing the characters up to and including the last occurrence of `char`. 
Output State: **`res` will have `char` added to it, `s` will be modified accordingly**
