According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` and `alphabet`. If `char` is in `alphabet`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `char` is in `s` then `res` is the string formed by replacing each `char` with the character that comes after it in `alphabet`, otherwise `res` remains unchanged and `char` is still in `s`. So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the next character in `alphabet` after the current `char` should be checked. 
State: **If `next_char` is in `s` then `res` is the string formed by replacing each `next_char` with the character that comes after it in `alphabet`. If `next_char` is not in `s`, `res` remains unchanged and `next_char` is still in `s**
