According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 3. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1
- If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` needs to be incremented by 1

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 4, `j` is incremented based on the condition**
