Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code takes a string `s` as input and checks if it contains the English alphabet as a subsequence. It iterates through the characters of `s` and compares them to the characters of the target string `'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'`. If all characters match in order, it prints the target string. Otherwise, it prints -1. The code follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases as it ensures the subsequence contains the English alphabet in order.
