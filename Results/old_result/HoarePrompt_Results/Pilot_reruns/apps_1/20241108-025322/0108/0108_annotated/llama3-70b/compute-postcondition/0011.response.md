Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the next character in the alphabet by incrementing the ASCII value of `char` by 1. Since `char` is the first character in `alphabet`, the next character in the alphabet is the second character in `alphabet`. Therefore, after execution, `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced with the second character in `alphabet`.

Output State: **`s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet, `res` is the first character in `alphabet` followed by `char`, `alphabet` is not empty, `char` is the second character in `alphabet`**
