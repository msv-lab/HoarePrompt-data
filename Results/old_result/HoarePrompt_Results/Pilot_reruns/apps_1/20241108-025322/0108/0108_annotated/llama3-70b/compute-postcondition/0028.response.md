According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `res` is appended with the value of `char`. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the value of `char` needs to still be in the string `s` after being appended to `res`.
State: **`res` is appended with the value of `char` and `char` is still in `s`**
