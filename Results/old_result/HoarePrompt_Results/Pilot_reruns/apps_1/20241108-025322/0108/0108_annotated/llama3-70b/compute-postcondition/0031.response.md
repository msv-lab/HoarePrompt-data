According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the character `char` is present in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `res` is the previous value of `res` concatenated with the replaced `char`, and `char` is still in `s`. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `char` needs to remain in `s`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`res` is the previous value of `res` concatenated with the replaced `char`, and `char` is still in `s`**
