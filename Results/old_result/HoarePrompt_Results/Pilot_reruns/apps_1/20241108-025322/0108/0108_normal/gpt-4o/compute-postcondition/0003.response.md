Example Answer:
`i` and `j` are assigned the value 0. The variables `s`, `target`, and `target_len` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 0, `j` is 0**
