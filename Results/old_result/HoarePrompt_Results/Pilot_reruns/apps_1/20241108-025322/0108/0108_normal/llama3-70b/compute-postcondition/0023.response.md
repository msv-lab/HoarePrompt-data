According to the code, the loop can execute again if `char` is still present in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is added to `res` in the order they were replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `s` has `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet and `char` is present in the modified `s`, `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters, and `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string after the last replacement, `char` is added to `res`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`char` is added to `res` in the order they were replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `s` has `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet and `char` is present in the modified `s`; `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters; `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string after the last replacement, `char` is added to `res`**
