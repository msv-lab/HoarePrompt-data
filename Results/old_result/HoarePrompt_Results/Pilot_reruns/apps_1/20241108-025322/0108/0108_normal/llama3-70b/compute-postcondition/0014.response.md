According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `char` is present in `s` and `char` is one of the characters in the `alphabet` string. At the end of the last iteration, if `char` is present in `s`, `res` will contain all occurrences of `char` in the order they were replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `s` will have `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` will contain all lowercase English letters, and `char` will be one of the characters in the `alphabet` string. To execute the loop one more time, `char` should be the next character in the `alphabet` string after the last replacement.
State: **If `char` is present in `s`, `res` will contain all occurrences of `char` in the order they were replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `s` will have `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` will contain all lowercase English letters, `char` will be the next character in the `alphabet` string after the last replacement**
