Example Answer: 
`res` is appended with the value of `char`, which is one of the characters in the `alphabet` string followed by the character `char`. Since `char` is not the last character in the alphabet, the next character in the alphabet is added to `res`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string that includes the character `char`, `char` is one of the characters in the `alphabet` string followed by the character `char` and `char` is not the last character in the alphabet.
Output State: **`s` is a string with `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string that includes the character `char`, `char` is one of the characters in the `alphabet` string followed by the character `char` and `char` is not the last character in the alphabet**
