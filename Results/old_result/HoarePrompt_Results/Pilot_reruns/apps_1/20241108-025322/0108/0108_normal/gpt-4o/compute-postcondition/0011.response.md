According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `target_len`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, and `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` matches `target[j]`. If `s[i]` matches `target[j]`, `j` is increased by 1.

To execute the loop one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` needs to be less than the length of `s`.
- `j` needs to be less than 26.
- If `s[i]` matches `target[j]`, then `j` needs to be increased by 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is increased by 1, `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on whether `s[i]` matches `target[j]`. If `s[i]` matches `target[j]`, `j` is increased by 1**
