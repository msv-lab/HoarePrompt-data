Example Answer: 
The character `char` in string `s` is replaced by the next character in the alphabet using the `replace` function. The new character is calculated by incrementing the ASCII value of `char` by 1. The `replace` function only replaces the first occurrence of `char`. After execution, the new value of `s` will have `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string that includes the character `char`, `char` is one of the characters in the `alphabet` string followed by the character `char`.
Output State: **`s` is a string with `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string that includes the character `char`, `char` is one of the characters in the `alphabet` string followed by the character `char`**
