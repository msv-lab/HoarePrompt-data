Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the `res` string. Since `res` already contains `char`, the final state is the same as the initial state with the addition of the character `char` at the end. 
Output State: **`s` is a string with `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string that includes the character `char`, `char` is one of the characters in the `alphabet` string followed by the character `char`**
