Example Answer:
The `char` in string `s` is replaced with the next character in the alphabet using the `replace` function. Since `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last replacement, `char` is added to `res`. The modified `s` now contains the updated `char`. 
Output State: **`char` is added to `res` in the order they were replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `s` has `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet and `char` is present in the modified `s`; `alphabet` contains all lowercase English letters; `char` is the next character in the `alphabet` string after the last replacement, `char` is added to `res`**
