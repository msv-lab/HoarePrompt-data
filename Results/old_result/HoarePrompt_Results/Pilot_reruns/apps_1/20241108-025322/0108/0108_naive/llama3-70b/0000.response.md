Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program iterates over the alphabet and replaces each character in the input string with the next character in alphabetical order until the entire alphabet is found in the input string. If the resulting string has a length of 26, it means that all characters of the alphabet have been found in the input string in order, and the program prints the resulting string. If the resulting string does not have a length of 26, it means that it was not possible to create the alphabet as a subsequence, and the program prints -1. The logic of the program correctly follows the problem description and there are no potential cases identified where the program does not work as expected.
