Functionality: ** The function `func` reads three input integers `a`, `b`, and `c`, calculates the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`, and then prints the result of the expression `min_lemon + min_lemon * 2 + min_lemon * 4`. The function does not have explicit return values or conditions stated in the annotations, so it operates based on the input values without any specific return logic mentioned. **
