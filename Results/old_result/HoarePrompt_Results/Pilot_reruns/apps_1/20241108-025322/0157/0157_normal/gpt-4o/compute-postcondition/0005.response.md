Example Answer:
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Since the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are not specified, we cannot determine the exact value of `max_lemons`. However, `total_fruits` is calculated as the sum of `max_lemons` multiplied by 1, 2, and 4. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer, and the `total_fruits` are calculated based on the aforementioned formula.
Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is a positive integer, and the `total_fruits` are calculated based on the aforementioned formula**
