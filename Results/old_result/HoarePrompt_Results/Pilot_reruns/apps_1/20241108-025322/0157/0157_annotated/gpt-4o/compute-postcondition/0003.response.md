Example Answer:
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The previous values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are known. Therefore, `max_lemons` will be assigned the minimum value among the inputs. 
Output State: **`a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is a user input integer, `c` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among a, b // 2, and c // 4**
