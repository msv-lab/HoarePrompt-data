Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly handles the case where the difference between any two neighboring elements is 0 (c = 0). It checks if the favorite number b is equal to the first element of the sequence, in which case it prints "YES". 
For the case where the difference between neighboring elements is not 0 (c != 0), the program checks if the difference between b and a is divisible by c and if the result is non-negative. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES"; otherwise, it prints "NO". 
The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
