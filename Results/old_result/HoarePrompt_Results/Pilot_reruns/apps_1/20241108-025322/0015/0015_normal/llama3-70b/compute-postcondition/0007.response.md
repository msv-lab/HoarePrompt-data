Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `c` is 0, then if `a` equals `b`, the program prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not 0 and the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is satisfied, then 'YES' is printed. In all other cases, including when the condition is not met or when `c` is not equal to 0, 'NO' is printed. `a`, `b`, and `c` remain unchanged regardless of the outcome of the if else block.***
