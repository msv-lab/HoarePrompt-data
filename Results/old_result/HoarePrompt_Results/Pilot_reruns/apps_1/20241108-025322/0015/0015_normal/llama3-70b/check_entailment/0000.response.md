Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input.
- If `c` is 0, it checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' in that case, correctly handling the scenario where `b` is the first element of the sequence.
- If `c` is not 0, it verifies if `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0` to print 'YES', which is consistent with the condition that Vasya's favorite number `b` appears in the sequence with a common difference `c`.
- The code covers all possible cases based on the problem description and provides the correct output for each.

Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases mentioned in the problem description.
