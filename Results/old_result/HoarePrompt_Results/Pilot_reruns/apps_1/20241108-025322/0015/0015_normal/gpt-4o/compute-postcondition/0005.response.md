Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers after mapping. If the condition `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0` is satisfied, then the program prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The program handles all cases where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers after mapping, ensuring that the result is accurately determined based on the conditions `(b - a) % c == 0` and `(b - a) / c >= 0`.***
