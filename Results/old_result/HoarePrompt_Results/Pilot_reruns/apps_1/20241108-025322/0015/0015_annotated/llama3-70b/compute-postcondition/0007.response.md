Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are values assigned based on user input. If c is 0 and a is equal to b, 'YES' is printed; if a is not equal to b, 'NO' is printed. If c is not 0, the condition (b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0 is checked. If the condition is met, 'YES' is printed; otherwise, 'NO' is printed. The variables `a`, `b`, and `c` retain their original values after the if-else block executes. The postcondition covers all edge cases and outcomes of the if-else block.***
