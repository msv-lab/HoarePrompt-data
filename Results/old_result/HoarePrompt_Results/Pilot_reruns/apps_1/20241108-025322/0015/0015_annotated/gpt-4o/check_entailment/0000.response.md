Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes three integers as input representing the first element of the sequence, Vasya's favorite number, and the difference between neighboring elements.
2. The program then correctly checks if Vasya's favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence and prints "YES" in that case.
3. If the difference between neighboring elements is zero, the program correctly prints "NO" as the favorite number will not appear in the sequence.
4. In all other cases, the program correctly checks if the favorite number can appear in the sequence by verifying if it satisfies the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) and prints "YES" or "NO" accordingly.

Overall, the program covers all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
