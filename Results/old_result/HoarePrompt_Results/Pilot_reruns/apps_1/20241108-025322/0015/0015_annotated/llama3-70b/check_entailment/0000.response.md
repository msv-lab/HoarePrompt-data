Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the problem description, the provided code, and the annotations, it can be observed that the code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. The code handles the cases where the difference between neighboring elements is zero, as well as the cases where the difference is non-zero. The code appropriately checks if Vasya's favorite number b appears in the generated sequence and outputs "YES" or "NO" accordingly. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of the code flow and the expected outcomes based on the input values. Additionally, the code covers all possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description, making it a correct solution.
