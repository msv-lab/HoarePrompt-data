Example Answer:
The code simply prints 'YES' to the console. There is no change in the state of the variables `a`, `b`, and `c` as they are not used in the code snippet. Therefore, the output state is `a, b, c` are integers within the valid range.
Output State: **`a, b, c` are integers within the valid range**
