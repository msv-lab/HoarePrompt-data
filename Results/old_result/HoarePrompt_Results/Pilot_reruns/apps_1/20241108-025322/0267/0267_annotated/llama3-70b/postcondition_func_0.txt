The function func_1 accepts three parameters l, r, and k. It utilizes these parameters as inputs for count function calls, calculates the final result by subtracting the results of count(r, k, dp) from count(l - 1, k, dp), and returns the result after applying the modulus operation with MOD. The function relies on a dictionary dp to store intermediate results during the computation.
