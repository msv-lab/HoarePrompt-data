The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. `l` and `r` are integers such that $1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}$, and `k` is an integer such that $1 \le k \le 10$. After executing the function body, the function iterates through the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive). For each `num` in this range, if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and taking the modulo `MOD`. The relationship between `l`, `r`, and `num` is maintained with `l` being less than or equal to `r`, and `num` being updated accordingly. If `func_1(num, k)` is false for all numbers in the range, then `total_sum` remains 0. The function returns `total_sum`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`. It iterates through the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) and updates `total_sum` by adding `num` and taking the modulo `MOD` if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true for a particular `num`. If `func_1(num, k)` is false for all numbers in the range, `total_sum` remains 0. The function returns `total_sum`.**
