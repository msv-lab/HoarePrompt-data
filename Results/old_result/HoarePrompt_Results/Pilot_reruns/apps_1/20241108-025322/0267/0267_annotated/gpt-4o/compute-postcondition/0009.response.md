Postcondition: ***`total_sum`, `l`, `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and taking the modulo operation with `MOD`. The relationship between `l`, `r`, and `num` is maintained with `l` being less than or equal to `r`, and `num` being equal to the current `num` + 1 or remains the same based on the evaluation of `func_1(num + 1, k)`. No changes occur if `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false.***
