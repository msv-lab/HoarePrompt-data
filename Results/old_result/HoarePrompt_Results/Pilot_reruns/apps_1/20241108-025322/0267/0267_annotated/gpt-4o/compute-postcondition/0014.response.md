Functionality: ** The function func_2 accepts three parameters: l, r, and k. It iterates through the range from l to r (inclusive) and updates total_sum by adding num and taking the modulo MOD if func_1(num, k) evaluates to true for a particular num. If func_1(num, k) is false for all numbers in the range, total_sum remains 0. The function then returns total_sum. **

The code executes the loop correctly as per the annotations, updating total_sum based on the condition of func_1(num, k). However, one potential edge case that is not covered in the annotations is if l is greater than r, in this case, the loop won't execute, and total_sum will remain 0.
