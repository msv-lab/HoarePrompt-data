Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After carefully reviewing the provided Python program and the problem description, it can be observed that the program accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement. 

The `func_1` function calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. It achieves this by calling the `count` function for both `r` and `l - 1` and then taking the difference to get the desired sum. The program considers all potential cases and edge cases, ensuring that the calculations are correct for each scenario. 

The `count` function is responsible for computing the number of valid numbers within a given range that satisfy the condition of having at most `k` different digits. It utilizes dynamic programming to store and retrieve previously computed values, optimizing the calculation process. The function handles all possible cases based on the provided constraints and accurately returns the expected results.

Overall, the program aligns with the problem description and provides the correct output for various test cases. Hence, the correctness of the program is verified to be True.
