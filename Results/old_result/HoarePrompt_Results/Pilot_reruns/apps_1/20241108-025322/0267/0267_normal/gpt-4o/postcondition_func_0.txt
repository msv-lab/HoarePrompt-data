The function func_1 accepts an integer n and a positive integer k. It then converts n to a string, creates a set of its characters, and checks if the length of the set is less than or equal to k. The function returns True if the condition is met and False otherwise. The function does not handle cases where n is negative or where k is not a positive integer.
