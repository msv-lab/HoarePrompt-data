The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`, all of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop won't execute, and `total_sum` will remain 0. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop iterates through each `num` in the range `l` to `r` inclusive. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true for a specific `num`, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. After the loop finishes, `total_sum`, `l`, and `r` retain their integer values, and the function returns `total_sum`.
Functionality: **The function accepts three integer parameters l, r, and k. If l is greater than r, total_sum remains 0. Otherwise, it iterates through the range from l to r inclusive, updates total_sum based on func_1(num, k) evaluation, and returns the final total_sum value.**
