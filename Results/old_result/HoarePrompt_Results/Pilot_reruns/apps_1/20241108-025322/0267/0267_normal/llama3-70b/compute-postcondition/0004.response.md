Output State: **n is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, k is a positive integer less than or equal to 10, dp is a dictionary storing the results of subproblems. If (n, k) is already in dp, the function returns the value stored at dp[n, k]. If (n, k) is not in dp, the function continues with its execution. If k is equal to 0, the function returns 0. dp[n, k] is assigned the value of n**
