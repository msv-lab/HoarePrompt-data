According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `k` is greater than 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **n is a non-negative integer less than 10^18, k is greater than 1, dp[n, k] is updated based on the calculation, i is 3**
