Correctness: **False**

The code does not handle cases where the input number `n` is negative, as the function `func_1` only checks if the length of the set of characters of `n` is less than or equal to `k`. This means negative numbers are not accounted for, which violates the problem description. The program should consider negative numbers within the given range as well.
