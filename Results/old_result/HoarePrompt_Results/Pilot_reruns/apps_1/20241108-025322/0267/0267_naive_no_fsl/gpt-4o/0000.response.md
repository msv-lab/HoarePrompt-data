Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines two functions, func_1 and func_2, which correctly check if a number contains at most k different digits and calculates the sum of numbers from l to r that satisfy this condition. The input is correctly taken, the calculations are done modulo 998244353, and the output is printed as expected. The program seems to follow the problem description for all potential cases, and the examples provided also produce the correct output. Therefore, the code is correct.
