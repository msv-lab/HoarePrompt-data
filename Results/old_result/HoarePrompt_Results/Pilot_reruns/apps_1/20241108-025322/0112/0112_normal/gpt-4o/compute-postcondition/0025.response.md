According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If there are more elements in the `digits` list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `used_cubes` has at least one element set to True, `found` is False. To execute the loop one more time, the `digits` list needs to have more elements, so it needs to be adjusted accordingly. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`used_cubes` has at least one element set to True, `found` is False, `digits` list has more elements**
