Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0. `used_cubes` is a list of n elements. If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the loop breaks. In all other cases, the program remains in the same state as the precondition, with no changes to any variables.***
