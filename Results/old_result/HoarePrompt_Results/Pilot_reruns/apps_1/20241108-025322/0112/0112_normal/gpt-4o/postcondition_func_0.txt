The function func_1 accepts an integer n representing the number of cubes Masha has and a list of lists cubes containing the digits on each face of the cubes. It calculates the smallest number that can be formed using these digits if n is at least 1, or returns 0 if n is 0. The function iterates through numbers starting from 1 until it finds the smallest number that can be formed using the digits on the cubes. If n is 0, the function returns 0.
