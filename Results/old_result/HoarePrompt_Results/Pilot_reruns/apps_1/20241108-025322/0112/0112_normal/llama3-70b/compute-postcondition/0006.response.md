The code snippet updates the set `digits` by adding the string representation of each digit in the second cube. Since the cube is the second cube in the list, we can assume it has a value. Therefore, each digit of the cube will be added to the set `digits`.

Output State: **n is greater than 0, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, digits is a set containing '1', '2', '3', '4', '5', '6', '7', '8', and 'cube' is the second cube in the list**
