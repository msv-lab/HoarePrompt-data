Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` as input and then reads `n` lists of 6 integers each representing the faces of `n` cubes. It extracts all unique digits from these cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts them in descending order, and concatenates them to form a single integer `max_num`. Finally, it prints out the value of `max_num`. The function handles the case where '0' is part of the extracted digits and correctly removes it.**
