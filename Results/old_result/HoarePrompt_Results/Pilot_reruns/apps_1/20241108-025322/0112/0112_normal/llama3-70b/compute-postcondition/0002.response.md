Example Answer:
The set `digits` is initialized as an empty set. Since no other variables are affected by this code, the output state is: n is an input integer, cubes is a list of n cubes where each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers, digits is an empty set.
Output State: **n is an input integer, cubes is a list of n cubes where each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers, digits is an empty set**
