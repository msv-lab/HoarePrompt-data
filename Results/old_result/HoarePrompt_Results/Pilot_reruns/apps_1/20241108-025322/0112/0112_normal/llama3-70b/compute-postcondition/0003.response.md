According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop will execute. At the start, n being an input integer does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0. Additionally, at the beginning of the loop, the digits set is empty. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, the cubes list must have at least 1 cube, and the cube being iterated on is the first cube in the list.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, digits is an empty set, cube is the first cube in the list**
