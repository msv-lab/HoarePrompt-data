Example Answer:
The function returns `True`. Since the loop does not execute when `digits` is empty, the values of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `used_cubes` is a list of n boolean values where each element is True if the cube is used, the loop successfully matches each digit with a cube. If `digits` is empty, the loop does not execute and returns False.
