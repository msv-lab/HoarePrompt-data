According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `cubes` list. If there are more lists in the `cubes` list, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list containing at least 3 lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list including the digits from the third list, `cube` is the third list in the `cubes` list. So for the loop to execute one more time, the `cubes` list must contain at least 4 lists and the `cube` variable should be set to the fourth list in the `cubes` list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list containing at least 4 lists of integers, `digits` is a set containing all the digits from all the integers in the `cubes` list including the digits from the fourth list, `cube` is the fourth list in the `cubes` list**
