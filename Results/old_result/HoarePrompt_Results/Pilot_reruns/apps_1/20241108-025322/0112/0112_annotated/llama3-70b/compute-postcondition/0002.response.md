Example Answer:
The set `digits` is initialized as an empty set. Since no other variables are affected by this code snippet, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `digits` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 3), `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers, `digits` is an empty set**
