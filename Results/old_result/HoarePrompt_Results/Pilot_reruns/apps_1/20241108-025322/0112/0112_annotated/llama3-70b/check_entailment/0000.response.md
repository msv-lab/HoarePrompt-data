Correctness: **False**

The code provided does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The issue lies in the fact that the code only considers the digits present on the cubes and forms the largest number possible without leading zeros. However, the code does not take into account the possibility of forming all numbers from 1 to x using the given cubes.

For example, in the second test case:
Input:
3
0 1 3 5 6 8
1 2 4 5 7 8
2 3 4 6 7 9

The code will output 98, which is the largest number that can be formed with the digits present on the cubes. However, the correct output should be 97, as it is possible to form all numbers from 1 to 97 using the given cubes.

Therefore, the code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
