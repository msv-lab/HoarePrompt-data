Example Answer:
The code reads `n` lists of integers input by the user and stores them in the list `cubes`. Since `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 3, the code will create a list of lists containing integers based on user input. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 â‰¤ n â‰¤ 3), `cubes` is a list containing `n` lists of integers**
