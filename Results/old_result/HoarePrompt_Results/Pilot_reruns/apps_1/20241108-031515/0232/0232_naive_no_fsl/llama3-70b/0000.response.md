Correctness: **True**

The program correctly follows the problem description by taking the input values, iterating through the intervals of Jedi Knights, and checking if there exists an interval with the prescribed color counts. The logic implemented in the code seems to cover all potential cases and accurately determines whether such an interval exists or not.
