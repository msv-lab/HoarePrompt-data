Postcondition: ***`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, `i` is less than `n`, `window_counts` contains the key `color` with an updated count value of 1, `j` is equal to the current index in the loop, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary, `color` is added to `window_counts` with a count value of 1. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, `found` is set to True, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. If the condition is not satisfied, the program continues execution without any changes to the initial state described in the precondition.***
