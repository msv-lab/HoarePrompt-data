Example Answer:
A dictionary `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The variables `found` remains False, `i` remains 0, and `n` remains greater than 0. The initialization of the dictionary does not affect the other variables.
Output State: **`found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
