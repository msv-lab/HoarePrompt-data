According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, found is False does not impact the execution of the loop, so it remains the same. The states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
