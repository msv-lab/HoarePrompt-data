Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The program reads the input values correctly.
- It then iterates through windows of colors to check if the counts match the desired counts.
- If a match is found, it sets `found` to True and breaks out of the loop.
- Finally, it prints 'YES' if a match is found, and 'NO' otherwise.
- The code seems to be following the problem description and the output hints correctly for all potential cases.
