The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. If `n` is less than 5, the function computes the factorial of `n` and returns the last digit of that factorial. Specifically, for `n` values of 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, the respective last digits of the factorial calculations are 1, 1, 2, 6, and 4. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is 5 or greater; otherwise, it returns the last digit of the factorial of `n` for values less than 5. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, returns 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5; if `n` is less than 5, it returns the last digit of the factorial of `n`.**
