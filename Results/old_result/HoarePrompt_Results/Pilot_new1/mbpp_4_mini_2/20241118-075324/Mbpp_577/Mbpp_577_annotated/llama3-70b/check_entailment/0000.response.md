Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly implement the requirement of finding the last digit of the factorial of a given number. According to the problem description, the function should return the last digit of the factorial of `n`. 

Let's analyze the provided code:

1. If `n < 2`, it returns `n`. For `n = 0`, the factorial is `1`, and thus the last digit should be `1`. For `n = 1`, the factorial is also `1`, and the last digit should be `1`. The code returns `0` for `n = 0` and `1` for `n = 1`, which is incorrect.

2. If `n` is `2` or `3`, it returns `n`, which means it would return `2` for `n=2` (correct last digit is `2`) and `3` for `n=3` (correct last digit is `6`, but it returns `3`, which is incorrect).

3. If `n` is `4`, it correctly returns `4`, as `4! = 24`, and the last digit is `4`.

4. For any `n` greater than `4`, it returns `0`. However, for any `n >= 5`, the factorial ends with `0` because of the multiplication by `10` (from `2 * 5`), so it should return `0` for all `n >= 5`. The program does return `0` for `n > 4`, but the reasoning and cases for `n < 5` are incorrect.

The annotations mention that for `n` greater than `4`, it returns `0`, which is correct. However, they do not correctly cover the cases for `n = 0`, `1`, `2`, and `3`, which are critical edge cases in the context of factorials.

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for several inputs, particularly for `n = 0`, `1`, and `3`. Therefore, it is incorrect.

In conclusion, since the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, the correctness is determined to be **False**.
