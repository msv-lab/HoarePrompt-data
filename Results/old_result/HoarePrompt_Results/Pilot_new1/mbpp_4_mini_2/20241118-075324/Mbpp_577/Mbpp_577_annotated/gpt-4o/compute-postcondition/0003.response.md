The variable `factorial` is initialized to 1. The previous state of `n` is not affected by this assignment, and since `n` is a non-negative integer less than 5, its value remains unchanged. Therefore, the output state reflects the initialization of `factorial` while keeping `n` as is.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than 5; `factorial` is 1**
