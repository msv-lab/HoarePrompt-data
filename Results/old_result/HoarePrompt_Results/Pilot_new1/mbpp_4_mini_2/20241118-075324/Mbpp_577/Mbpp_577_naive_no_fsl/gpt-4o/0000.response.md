Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case when `n` is 0 or 1. According to the problem description, the program should return the last digit of the factorial of any non-negative integer `n`, including 0 and 1. 

- For `n = 0`: The factorial of 0 is 1, and therefore the last digit should be 1.
- For `n = 1`: The factorial of 1 is also 1, and thus the last digit should again be 1.

However, the current implementation does not address these cases and would return `1` correctly for both. But since it explicitly checks for `n >= 5` and returns `0`, it fails to handle these edge cases correctly.

Thus, the program is incomplete and does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
