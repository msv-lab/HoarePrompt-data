Output State: **If `num` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and the function returns False. If `num` is 2 or greater, the loop checks for divisibility starting from `i = 2` up to `i = int(num ** 0.5)`. After the loop executes, if `i` is equal to or less than `int(num ** 0.5)`, and if `num` is divisible by `i`, the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, it implies `num` is prime, but no return statement is executed, indicating further logic may be needed to handle the return for prime cases.**
