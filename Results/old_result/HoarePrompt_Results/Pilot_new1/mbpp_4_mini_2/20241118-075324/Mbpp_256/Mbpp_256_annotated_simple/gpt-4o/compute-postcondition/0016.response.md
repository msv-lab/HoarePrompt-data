According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 2, and `is_prime` has `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` as False. The loop starts with `i` equal to 2. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to the integer value of the square root of `n`. Since `i` is currently 2, we need to ensure that `2` is still less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. 

If `i` is currently 2, then for the loop to execute again, we need to increment `i` to 3 for the next iteration. Therefore, we need to ensure that `i` is set to 3 and check if it is still within the bounds defined by `n`. 

Since we have no further constraints on `n` other than it being at least 2, we can conclude that `n` must be at least 9 for `i` to be 3 and still satisfy `i <= int(n ** 0.5)`.

State: **`n` is at least 9, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False, `i` is 3**
