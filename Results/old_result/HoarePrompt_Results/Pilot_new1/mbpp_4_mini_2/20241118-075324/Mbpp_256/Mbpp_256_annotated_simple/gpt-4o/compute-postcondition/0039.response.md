The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, the function does not return any value. Additionally, the program returns the sum of the boolean values in the list 'is_prime', which counts the number of True values, representing the prime numbers in the range from 2 to n-1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2; if `n` is greater than 2, it counts and returns the number of prime numbers in the range from 2 to n-1. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns 0 if n is less than or equal to 2; if n is greater than 2, it returns the count of prime numbers in the range from 2 to n-1.**
