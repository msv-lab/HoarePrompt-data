Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 9, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False. If `is_prime[3]` is True, all multiples of 3 from 9 up to but not including `n` are marked as False in `is_prime`. If `is_prime[3]` is False, the list remains unchanged with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False.***
