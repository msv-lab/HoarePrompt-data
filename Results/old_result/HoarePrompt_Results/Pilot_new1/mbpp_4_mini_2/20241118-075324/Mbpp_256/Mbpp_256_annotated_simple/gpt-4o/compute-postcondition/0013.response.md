According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `4 + 2i` and `n` is greater than `4 + 2i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value in the range, which is `j + i`. 

Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to `4 + 2i + i`, which simplifies to `4 + 3i`. Since `n` is already greater than `4 + 2i`, it will also be greater than `4 + 3i` if `i` is at least 1.

Thus, the updated state will reflect these changes:
State: **`n` is greater than `4 + 3i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2]` is True, `is_prime[4]` is False, `j` is `4 + 3i`, and `is_prime[j]` is False**
