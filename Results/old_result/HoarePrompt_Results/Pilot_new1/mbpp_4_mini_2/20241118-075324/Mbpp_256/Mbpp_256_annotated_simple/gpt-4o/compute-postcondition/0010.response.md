The value of `j` is calculated as `4 + i`. Since `n` is greater than `j + i`, it implies that `j` is a valid index for the `is_prime` list. The code sets `is_prime[j]` to `False`. The previous values indicate that `is_prime[4]` is currently `False`, and the value of `is_prime[j]` is being set to `False`, which does not change its state.

Therefore, the output state remains consistent with the previous values, and the impact of the code is that `is_prime[j]` is explicitly set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than `j + i`, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2]` is True, `is_prime[4]` is False, `j` is `4 + i`, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False**
