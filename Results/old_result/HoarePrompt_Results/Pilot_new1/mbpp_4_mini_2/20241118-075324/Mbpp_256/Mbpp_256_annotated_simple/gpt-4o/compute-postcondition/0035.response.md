Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 9, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` as False. If `is_prime[4]` is True and `n` is greater than 16, then all multiples of 4 from 16 up to `n` (exclusive) are set to False in the `is_prime` list. If `n` is less than or equal to 16, or if `is_prime[4]` is False, the `is_prime` list remains unchanged with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False.***
