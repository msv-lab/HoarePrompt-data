According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 12, and `n` is at least 12. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. Therefore, `j` must be adjusted to the next value calculated by the expression `j + i`, which results in `j` being 15 (since `i` is 3). The state of `n` remains unchanged as it is still at least 12.

State: **`n` is at least 12, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `is_prime[9]` is False, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, and `is_prime[12]` is now False**
