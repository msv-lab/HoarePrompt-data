According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 9, and `n` is at least 9. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value calculated by `j += i`, which means `j` will become 12 (since `i` is 3). 

Since `j` (12) must be less than `n` for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `n` is at least 12. 

Therefore, the adjusted states should be:
- `n` is at least 12 (to ensure `j` can be 12 and still be less than `n`)
- `j` is updated to 12.

State: **`n` is at least 12, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, and `is_prime[9]` is set to False**
