The loop iterates over a range starting from `i * i` and increments by `i` until it reaches `n`, marking multiples of `i` as non-prime in the `is_prime` list. 

If `i` is 2, the loop will execute for `j` values starting from 4, marking even numbers greater than 2 as False in the `is_prime` list. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`.

The loop will not execute if `i * i` is greater than or equal to `n`, which means for values of `i` greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, the loop will not run. 

Output State: **If `n` is at least 2 and `i` is 2, then `is_prime` will have `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, `is_prime[2]` as True, and all even indices greater than 2 will be set to False. If `i` is greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged except for indices already set to False.**
