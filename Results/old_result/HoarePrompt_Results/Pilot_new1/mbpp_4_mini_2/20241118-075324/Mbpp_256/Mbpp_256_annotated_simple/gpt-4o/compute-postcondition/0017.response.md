According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j`, which is initialized to `i * i`, and the range defined by `n`. Since `i` is 3, `j` will start at \(3 * 3 = 9\). The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n` and increments by `i` (which is 3) in each iteration.

Given that `n` is at least 9, the loop will execute starting from `j = 9`. For the loop to be executed correctly, the following states need to be established:

1. `n` must be at least 9 (which it is).
2. `j` should start at 9 (which it will, as \(i * i = 9\)).
3. The loop will execute as long as `j < n`.

Thus, the state can be summarized as follows:

State: **`n` is at least 9, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False, `i` is 3, `j` is 9**
