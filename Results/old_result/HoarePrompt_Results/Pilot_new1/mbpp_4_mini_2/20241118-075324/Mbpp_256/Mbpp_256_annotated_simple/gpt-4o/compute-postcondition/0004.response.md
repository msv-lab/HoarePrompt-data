The values of `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to `False`. The initial state indicates that `is_prime` is a list of length `n` initialized with all `True` values, but the specific values of `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are updated. The other elements of the list remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as `False`, `is_prime[1]` as `False`, and all other elements remain `True`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False, `is_prime[1]` as False, and all other elements remain True**
