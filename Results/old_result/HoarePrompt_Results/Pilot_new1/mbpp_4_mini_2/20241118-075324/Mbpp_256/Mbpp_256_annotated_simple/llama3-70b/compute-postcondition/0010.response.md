According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `num`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `num` is greater than 2. We need to check if `i` can be incremented and still satisfy the loop condition.

To prepare for the next iteration:
- The current value of `i` is 3. In the next iteration, `i` will be increased to 4.
- We need to ensure that `i` (which will be 4 in the next iteration) is still less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`.

Since `num` is greater than 2, and `i` is currently 3, we can conclude that `num` must be at least 17 for `int(num ** 0.5)` to be 4 or greater (since âˆš17 is approximately 4.12). Thus, to ensure the loop can execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `num` is at least 17.

State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 17, `i` is 4**
