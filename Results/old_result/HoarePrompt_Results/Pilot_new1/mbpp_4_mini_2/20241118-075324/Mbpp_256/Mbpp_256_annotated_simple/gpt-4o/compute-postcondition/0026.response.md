According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the result of the expression `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. The loop iterates from 2 up to `int(n ** 0.5)`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 9, which means that `int(n ** 0.5)` is at least 3. Since the loop starts at 2, it will execute for values of `i` from 2 up to at least 3. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. Therefore, if `i` is currently 3 (the last value it would take before the loop would stop), then for the loop to execute again, `i` needs to be incremented to 4. 

Thus, the conditions for `n` and `is_prime` remain unchanged, but `i` needs to be adjusted to 4. 

State: **`n` is at least 9, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False, `i` is 4**
