The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, the function does not return any value (implicitly returns None). Additionally, the function returns the count of prime numbers between 2 and n-1, which is the sum of True values in the list `is_prime`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2, or the count of prime numbers between 2 and n-1 if `n` is greater than 2.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter n, returns 0 if n is less than or equal to 2. If n is greater than 2, it returns the count of prime numbers between 2 and n-1.**
