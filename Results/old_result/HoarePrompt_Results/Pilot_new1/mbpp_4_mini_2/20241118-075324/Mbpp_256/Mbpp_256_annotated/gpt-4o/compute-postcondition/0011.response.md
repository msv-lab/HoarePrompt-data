According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `n` is greater than 6. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to calculate the next value of `j` based on the loop's range. The loop starts at `i * i` (which is 2 * 2 = 4) and increments `j` by `i` (which is 2) for each iteration. Thus, the next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which equals 4 + 2 = 6.

Now we need to check if this new value of `j` is still less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 6, `j` being 6 means that the loop will not execute again because the range is defined as `range(6, n, 2)`, and it will not include 6.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to reflect that `j` is now 6, while `n` remains greater than 6.

State: **`n` is greater than 6, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2]` is True, `is_prime[3]` is True, `is_prime[4]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `5` to `n-1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 6**
