The code assigns `False` to `is_prime[j]`. The value of `j` is not specified in the initial state, so we cannot determine the specific index being modified in the `is_prime` array. However, it is clear that one of the entries in the `is_prime` array is being updated to `False`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, `is_prime[2]` is True, `i` is 2, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False for an unspecified `j`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, `is_prime[2]` is True, `i` is 2, and `is_prime[j]` is set to False for an unspecified `j`.**
