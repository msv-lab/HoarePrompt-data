Output State: **If n is at least 2, then `is_prime[i]` will be set to False for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` to `n - 1` for each prime `i` found up to `sqrt(n)`. If n is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged for indices from `2` to `n-1`, which means `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, and `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`. If n is exactly 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged.**
