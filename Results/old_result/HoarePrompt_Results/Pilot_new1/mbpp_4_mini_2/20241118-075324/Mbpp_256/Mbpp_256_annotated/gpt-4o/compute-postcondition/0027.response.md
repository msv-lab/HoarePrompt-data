According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from `i * i` to `n`, with a step of `i`. For the loop to execute, the starting point `i * i` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` is at least 2 and `i` is equal to `int(n`, we need to ensure that `i * i < n`. 

Since `i` is equal to `int(n`, it means `i` is equal to `n` when `n` is an integer. In this case, `i * i` would be `n * n`, which is greater than or equal to `n` (and thus greater than `n` for all `n > 1`). Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` is less than the square root of `n` (i.e., `i < sqrt(n)`). 

Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, we can set `i` to a value that satisfies this condition. For example, if `n` is 4, then `i` could be 2. 

Thus, the adjusted state needs to ensure that `i` is less than `sqrt(n)` and `j` should be initialized to `i * i`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, `i` is less than sqrt(n), `j` is equal to i * i**
