Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, and if `is_prime[i]` is True, then for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n`, `is_prime[j]` is set to False. If `i` is greater than or equal to the square root of `n`, or if `n` is less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute, and `is_prime` remains unchanged for indices from `2` to `n-1`.***
