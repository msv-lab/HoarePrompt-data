According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `j` is less than `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is less than `sqrt(n)`. 

To determine the state at the beginning of the next iteration of the loop, we need to adjust `j`. The loop increments `j` by `i` in each iteration, so for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value, which is `j + i`.

Thus, the conditions for the next iteration would be:
- `n` remains greater than or equal to 2.
- `is_prime[j]` is still False for the updated index `j`.
- `j` is now `j + i`, which must still be less than `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[j]` is False for the updated index `j + i`, `j` is less than `n`, and `i` is less than `sqrt(n)`**
