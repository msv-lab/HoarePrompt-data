According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `num`. The loop starts at 2 and runs up to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. For the loop to execute, `num` must be at least 2, as the range starts at 2. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False and the loop will not execute. 

Given that `num` is a non-negative integer and we need to ensure the loop executes, we can conclude:
- `num` must be 2 or greater.
- The initial value of `i` will start at 2.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `num` is at least 2, and `i` is initialized to 2.

State: **`num` is 2 or greater, `i` is 2**
