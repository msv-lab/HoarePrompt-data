The code sets `is_prime[j]` to False. The variable `j` is currently 4, and `is_prime[4]` is being set to False. Since `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, we know that `is_prime[4]` was originally True. Therefore, after this assignment, `is_prime[4]` becomes False. The states of the other variables remain unchanged.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 6, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2]` is True, `is_prime[3]` is True, `is_prime[4]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `5` to `n-1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 4**
