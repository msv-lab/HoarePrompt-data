Output State: **`is_prime[j]` is False for all indices `j` that are multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to `n`, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is less than or equal to `sqrt(n)`, if `i` is greater than or equal to `sqrt(n)` the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged for indices in that range.**
