The function `is_prime` accepts a parameter `num`. `num` is a non-negative integer. 

- Case 1: If `num` is less than 2, the function returns `False`. If `num` is 2 or greater, the function does not return any value (implicitly returns `None`).
  
- Case 2: If `num` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and the function returns `False`. If `num` is 2 or greater, the loop checks for divisibility of `num` by integers starting from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any of these integers, the function returns `False`, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is not divisible by any of these integers, the loop completes without returning, and the function implicitly returns `None`.

- Case 3: If the function completes the loop without finding any divisors, it returns `True`, indicating that `num` is a prime number.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `is_prime` is to accept a non-negative integer `num` and determine whether it is a prime number, returning `False` for numbers less than 2 or non-prime numbers, `True` for prime numbers, and implicitly returning `None` for numbers 2 or greater that are not prime. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns `False` if `num` is less than 2 or if `num` is not prime. It returns `True` if `num` is a prime number.**
