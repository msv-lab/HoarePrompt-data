According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `i` is 2
- `j` is 6
- `n` is greater than 6

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to determine the next value of `j`, which is calculated as `j + i`. Since `j` is currently 6 and `i` is 2, the next value of `j` will be `6 + 2 = 8`.

Now we need to ensure that this new value of `j` is still less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 6, we can conclude that for the loop to execute again, `n` must be greater than 8.

Thus, the adjustments needed are:
- Update `n` to be greater than 8.
- Update `j` to be 8.

State: **`n` is greater than 8, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[2]` is True, `is_prime[3]` is True, `is_prime[4]` is False, `is_prime[5]` is True, `is_prime[6]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `7` to `n-1`, `i` is 2, `j` is 8**
