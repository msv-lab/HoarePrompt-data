According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have the following states:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2,
- `is_prime[j]` is False for the updated index `j + i`,
- `j` is less than `n`,
- `i` is less than `sqrt(n)`.

Since the loop uses `range(i * i, n, i)`, the next value of `j` will be `j + i`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the updated `j` (which would be `j + i`) is still less than `n`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state of `j` to be `j + i`, and we must ensure that `j + i` is still less than `n`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[j + i]` is False, `j` is less than `n - i`, and `i` is less than `sqrt(n)`**
