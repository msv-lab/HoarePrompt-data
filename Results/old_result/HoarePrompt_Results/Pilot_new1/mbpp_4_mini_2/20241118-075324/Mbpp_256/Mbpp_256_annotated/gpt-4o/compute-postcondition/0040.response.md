The function `func_1` accepts a non-negative integer parameter `n`. It first checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2; if so, it returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, the function uses the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm to determine the primality of numbers from 2 to `n-1`, storing the results in a list called `is_prime`. Finally, it returns the count of prime numbers in that range by summing the `True` values in the `is_prime` list.

However, the annotations suggest that if `n` is greater than 2, the function does not return any value (implicitly returns None), which is incorrect. The actual code does return the count of prime numbers in that case. 

Functionality: ** The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is greater than 2, it returns the count of prime numbers between 2 and `n-1`. **
