The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns `False` if `num` is less than 2 or if `num` is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `num`. It returns `True` if `num` is a prime number. If `num` is 2 or greater and not divisible by any integers in that range, it will return `True`, but if `num` is less than 2, it will return `False`. The function does not explicitly handle the case where `num` is exactly 2, but it will return `True` correctly since 2 is a prime number.
