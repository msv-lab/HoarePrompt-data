According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `j` and the range defined by `n`. The loop iterates over the range starting from `i * i` to `n`, incrementing by `i`.

At the end of the last iteration, we know:
- `n` is greater than or equal to 2,
- `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`,
- `i` is less than sqrt(n),
- `is_prime[j]` is set to False.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `n`. The current value of `j` is `i * i` from the start of the loop. Therefore, to ensure the loop can execute again, we need to adjust the state of `j` to be the next value in the range, which would be `j + i`.

Thus, we need to adjust the state of `j` to be `j` is less than `n` and incremented by `i`. Since `j` was set to `i * i` at the start of the loop, we can infer that for the loop to execute again, we need:

- `j` needs to be updated to `i * i + i`.

Since `j` is being set to False in the previous iteration, we don't need to change the state of `is_prime[j]` further.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from `2` to `n-1`, `i` is less than sqrt(n), `j` is less than n and `j` is `i * i + i`**
