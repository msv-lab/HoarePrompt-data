The variable `is_prime[j]` is assigned the value `False`. The initial state indicates that `is_prime[j]` was already `False` for the updated index `j`, and this assignment does not change its value. The other variables (`n`, `j`, and `i`) remain unaffected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[j]` is False for the updated index `j`, `j` is less than `n`, and `i` is less than `sqrt(n)`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[j]` is False for the updated index `j`, `j` is less than `n`, and `i` is less than `sqrt(n)`**
