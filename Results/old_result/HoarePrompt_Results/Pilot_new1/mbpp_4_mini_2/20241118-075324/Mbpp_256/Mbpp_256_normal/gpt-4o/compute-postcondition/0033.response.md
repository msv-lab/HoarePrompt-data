According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 24 and `n` is greater than 24. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be updated to the next value in the range, which is `j + i`. Since `i` is 4, the next value of `j` will be 28. Additionally, `n` must be at least 28 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the adjustments needed are: 
- `j` should be updated to 28.
- `n` should be adjusted to be greater than 28.

State: **`n` is greater than 28, `i` is 4, `j` is 28, `is_prime[16]` is set to False, `is_prime[20]` is set to False, `is_prime[24]` is set to False**
