According to the code, the loop executes based on the value of `i` and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than or equal to 9. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to evaluate `int(n ** 0.5)`. 

1. If `n` is exactly 9, then `int(n ** 0.5)` is 3, which means the loop will not execute again because `i` will become 4 in the next iteration (which is greater than 3).
2. If `n` is greater than 9, then `int(n ** 0.5)` will be greater than 3, allowing the loop to execute again with `i` incremented to 4.

Since we know `n` is greater than or equal to 9 and `i` is currently 3, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `n` remains greater than 9. 

Thus, the necessary adjustments to the state are:
- `n` must be greater than 9 to allow the loop to execute again.
- `i` will increment to 4 in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is greater than 9, `i` is 4**
