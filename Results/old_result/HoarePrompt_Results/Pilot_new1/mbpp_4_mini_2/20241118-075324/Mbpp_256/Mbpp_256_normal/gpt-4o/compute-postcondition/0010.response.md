The code assigns `False` to `is_prime[j]`. The value of `j` is 6, so `is_prime[6]` is set to `False`. Other variables are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 6, `i` is 2, `is_prime[i]` is true, `j` is 6, `is_prime[4]` is now False, and `is_prime[6]` is now False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 6, `i` is 2, `is_prime[i]` is true, `j` is 6, `is_prime[4]` is now False, `is_prime[6]` is now False**
