The statement `is_prime[j] = False` assigns the value `False` to the index `j` of the list `is_prime`. Since `j` is 12, this means `is_prime[12]` is set to `False`. The values of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `is_prime[9]`) remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, `is_prime[9]` is False, and `is_prime[12]` is set to False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, `is_prime[9]` is False, and `is_prime[12]` is set to False**
