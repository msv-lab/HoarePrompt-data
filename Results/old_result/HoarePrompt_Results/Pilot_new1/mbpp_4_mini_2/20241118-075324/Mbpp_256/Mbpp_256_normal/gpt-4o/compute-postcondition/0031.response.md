According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `n`, and `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 20, `n` is greater than 20, and `i` is 4. 

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust `j` to the next value according to the loop's increment. The loop increments `j` by `i` (which is 4) in each iteration. Therefore, the next value of `j` will be `20 + 4 = 24`. 

Since `n` is greater than 20, it does not need to be adjusted, but we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 24 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 24, `i` is 4, `j` is 24, `is_prime[16]` is set to False, and `is_prime[20]` is set to False**
