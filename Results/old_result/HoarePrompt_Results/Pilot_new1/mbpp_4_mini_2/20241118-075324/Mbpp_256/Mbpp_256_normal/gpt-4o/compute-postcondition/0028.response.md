The code assigns the value `False` to the index `j` of the list `is_prime`. The initial state does not provide information about the list `is_prime`, but the other variables `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state will reflect the unchanged values of `n`, `i`, and `j`, along with the assignment made to `is_prime[j]`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 17, `i` is 4, `j` is 16, and `is_prime[16]` is set to False**
