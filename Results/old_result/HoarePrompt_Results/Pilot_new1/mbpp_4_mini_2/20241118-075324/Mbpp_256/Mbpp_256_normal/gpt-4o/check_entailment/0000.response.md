To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the code and the problem description step by step.

**Problem Description**: The function should take a non-negative number and return the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.

**Program**:
```python
def func_1(n):
    if n <= 2:
        return 0
    is_prime = [True] * n
    is_prime[0] = is_prime[1] = False
    for i in range(2, int(n ** 0.5) + 1):
        if is_prime[i]:
            for j in range(i * i, n, i):
                is_prime[j] = False
    return sum(is_prime)
```

**Output hints**: The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is greater than 2, it counts and returns the number of prime numbers less than `n`. The function correctly identifies prime numbers using the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm.

**Initial Assessment**:
1. The function checks if `n` is less than or equal to 2 and returns 0, which is correct because there are no prime numbers less than 2.
2. For `n > 2`, the Sieve of Eratosthenes algorithm is implemented correctly to mark non-prime numbers.
3. The function then sums the `is_prime` list, which correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than `n`.

**Edge Cases**:
- When `n = 0` or `n = 1`, the function should return 0, which it does.
- When `n = 2`, the function also correctly returns 0.
- For `n = 3`, it should return 1 (the prime number is 2).
- For `n = 4`, it should return 2 (the prime numbers are 2 and 3).

**Output Hints Agreement**:
The output hints confirm that the function is expected to return 0 for `n <= 2` and correctly count primes for `n > 2`. The hints also mention the use of the Sieve of Eratosthenes, which is accurately reflected in the code.

**Conclusion**:
The function appears to handle all specified cases correctly based on both the problem description and the output hints. There are no edge cases that the function does not cover.

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function correctly implements the Sieve of Eratosthenes to count prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`, returning the expected results for all cases defined in the problem description.
