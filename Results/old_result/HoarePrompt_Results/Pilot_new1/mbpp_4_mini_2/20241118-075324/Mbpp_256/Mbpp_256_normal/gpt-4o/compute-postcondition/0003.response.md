The list `is_prime` is created with a length of `n`, and all its elements are initialized to `True`. The value of `n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function would have returned 0, but since the code provided does not include a return statement and only initializes the list, we don't have a return value. Therefore, the output state reflects the condition of `n` and the initialization of `is_prime`.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer; `is_prime` is a list of length `n` initialized to all True**
