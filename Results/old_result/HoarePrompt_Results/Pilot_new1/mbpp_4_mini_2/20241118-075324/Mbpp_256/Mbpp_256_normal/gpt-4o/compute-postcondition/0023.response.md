According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `j`, `n`, and `i`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `n` is greater than 12
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 15

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to check if `j` is less than `n`. Since `j` is currently 15 and `n` is greater than 12, we can conclude that `j` could potentially be less than `n` if `n` is greater than 15. 

However, since `j` is 15, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `j` will be updated to the next value in the range. The next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is `15 + 3 = 18`. 

Therefore, we need to adjust the state to indicate that `j` is now 18. We also need to ensure that `n` is greater than 18 for the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than 18, `i` is 3, `j` is 18, `is_prime[9]` is False, `is_prime[12]` is False, and `is_prime[15]` is set to False**
