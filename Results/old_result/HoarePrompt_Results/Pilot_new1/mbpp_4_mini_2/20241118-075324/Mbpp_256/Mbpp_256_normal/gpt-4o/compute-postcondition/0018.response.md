The code assigns the value `False` to the index `j` of the list `is_prime`. The variable `j` has a value of 9, which means `is_prime[9]` will be set to `False`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, and `is_prime[9]` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, and `is_prime[9]` is set to `False**
