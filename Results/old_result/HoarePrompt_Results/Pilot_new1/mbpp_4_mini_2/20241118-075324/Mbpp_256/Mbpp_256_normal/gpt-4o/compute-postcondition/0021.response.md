According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `j`, `n`, and `i`. The loop iterates with `j` starting from `i * i` and increments by `i` until it reaches `n`. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 12, `n` is greater than 12, and `i` is 3. For the loop to execute one more time, we need to check the next value of `j`, which would be `j + i = 12 + 3 = 15`. 

Since `n` is greater than 12, it is guaranteed that `j` (which will be 15) is still less than `n`. Therefore, we need to update `j` to 15 for the next iteration.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, `is_prime[9]` is False, and `is_prime[12]` is set to False**
