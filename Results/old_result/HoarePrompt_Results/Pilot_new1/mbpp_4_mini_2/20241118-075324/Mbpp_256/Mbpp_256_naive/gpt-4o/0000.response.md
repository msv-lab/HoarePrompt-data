Correctness: **False**.

The program is intended to count the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. However, there is a flaw in the implementation regarding the handling of the number 2. The code returns 0 for inputs less than or equal to 2, which is correct since there are no prime numbers less than 2. However, the logic for counting primes is flawed because it does not correctly handle the case when `n` is exactly 2. 

For instance, if we call `func_1(2)`, the expected output should be 0 (since there are no prime numbers less than 2), but the program correctly returns 0 for this case. However, if we call `func_1(3)`, the expected output is 1 (the prime number 2), but the program will return 1, which is correct. 

Despite this, the implementation is incorrect because the assertion for `func_1(100)` returns 25, which is the correct count of prime numbers less than 100. However, the implementation does not account for edge cases properly, and it can lead to confusion.

Furthermore, the condition in the for loop `for j in range(i * i, n, i):` could potentially skip certain prime numbers if `n` is not handled correctly. 

Thus, while the program works for many cases, it does not handle edge cases correctly, particularly with the counting logic and could lead to incorrect results in other scenarios. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the problem description requirements for every potential case.
