Correctness: **True**.

The program correctly implements the logic to count the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number. The function `is_prime` accurately checks for primality by testing divisibility from 2 up to the square root of the number, which is an efficient method. The outer loop correctly iterates through all numbers from 2 to `n-1`, counting how many of those are prime. 

All edge cases, such as when `n` is 0 or 1 (where there are no prime numbers), are handled correctly, as the loop will not run, and the function will return 0. For any other non-negative input, the program will correctly count and return the number of primes. Thus, the implementation meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
