Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to count the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative integer `n`. 

Here's a breakdown of how it works:
1. The `is_prime` function checks if a number is prime. It correctly identifies numbers less than 2 as non-prime and checks divisibility for numbers greater than or equal to 2.
2. The main function `func_1` iterates through all numbers from 2 to `n-1` and uses `is_prime` to count how many of these numbers are prime.
3. The function correctly returns the count of prime numbers less than `n`.

The function handles edge cases:
- If `n` is 0 or 1, the function will return 0, which is correct since there are no prime numbers less than these values.
- For any other non-negative integer, the function will accurately count the primes.

I cannot identify any potential cases where the program fails to meet the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
