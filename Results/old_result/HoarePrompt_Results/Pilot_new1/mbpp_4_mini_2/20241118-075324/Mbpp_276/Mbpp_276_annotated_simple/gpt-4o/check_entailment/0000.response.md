To evaluate the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the annotations.

### Problem Description
The program is supposed to take in the radius and height of a cylinder and return the volume.

### Annotated Program
```python
def func_1(radius, height):
    volume = math.pi * radius ** 2 * height
    return volume
    #The program returns the calculated volume as math.pi * radius
```

### Code Analysis
1. **Volume Calculation**: The formula for the volume of a cylinder is given by:
   \[
   \text{Volume} = \pi \times r^2 \times h
   \]
   where \( r \) is the radius and \( h \) is the height. The code correctly implements this formula.

2. **Return Statement**: The function computes the volume and returns it correctly.

3. **Imports**: The code uses `math.pi`, but it does not import the `math` module. This will lead to a `NameError` if the function is called because `math` is not defined.

4. **Annotations**: The annotation states that the program returns the calculated volume as `math.pi * radius`, which is incorrect. The correct formula involves multiplying by the height as well.

### Potential Issues
- **Import Error**: The program will not run successfully due to the missing import statement for the `math` module. Therefore, it cannot handle any input without raising an error.
- **Incorrect Annotation**: The annotation does not accurately describe the code's functionality.

### Conclusion
Given the issues identified, particularly the missing import statement that will prevent the function from executing correctly, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.

Correctness: **False**
