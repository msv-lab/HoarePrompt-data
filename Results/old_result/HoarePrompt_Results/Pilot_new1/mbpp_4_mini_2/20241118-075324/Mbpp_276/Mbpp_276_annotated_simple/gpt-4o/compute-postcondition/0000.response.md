The variable `volume` is assigned the value calculated from the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. The values of `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers, but their specific values are not provided. Therefore, `volume` is calculated based on these variables, resulting in a non-negative real number. The states of the other variables are not affected. 

Output State: **`radius` is a non-negative real number, `height` is a non-negative real number, and `volume` is a non-negative real number calculated as math.pi * radius ** 2 * height**
