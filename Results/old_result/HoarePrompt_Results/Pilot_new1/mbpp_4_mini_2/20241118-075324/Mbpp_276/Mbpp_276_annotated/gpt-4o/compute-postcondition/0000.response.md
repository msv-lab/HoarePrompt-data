The variable `volume` is assigned the value calculated by the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. Since `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers, `volume` will also be a non-negative real number. The specific values of `radius` and `height` are not provided, so we cannot calculate an exact numerical value for `volume`. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship defined by the formula.

Output State: **`radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers; `volume` is calculated as math.pi * radius ** 2 * height**.
