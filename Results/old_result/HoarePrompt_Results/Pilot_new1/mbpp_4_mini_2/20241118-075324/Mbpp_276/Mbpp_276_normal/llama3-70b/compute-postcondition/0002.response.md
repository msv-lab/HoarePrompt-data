Functionality: ** The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are expected to be non-negative real numbers, and it returns the volume of a cylinder calculated as π * radius² * height. However, the function does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` are negative, which could lead to incorrect results or undefined behavior.**
