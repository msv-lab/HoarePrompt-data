The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. After executing the function body, it returns the volume of a cylinder calculated as π * radius² * height. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative real numbers `radius` and `height` and return the volume of a cylinder based on these parameters.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters radius and height, both non-negative real numbers, and returns the volume of a cylinder calculated as π * radius² * height.**
