Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirement to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss by comparing the cost price and the selling price. The function `func_1` returns `True` if both prices are equal, indicating no profit or loss, and `False` otherwise. 

There are no edge cases or potential inputs that would cause the function to behave incorrectly according to the problem description. For example:

- If `cost_price` is 100 and `selling_price` is also 100, the function returns `True`, which is correct.
- If `cost_price` is 100 and `selling_price` is 90, the function returns `False`, which is also correct, indicating a loss.
- If `cost_price` is 100 and `selling_price` is 110, the function returns `False`, indicating a profit.

Since the function behaves as expected for all possible cases, it is correct.
