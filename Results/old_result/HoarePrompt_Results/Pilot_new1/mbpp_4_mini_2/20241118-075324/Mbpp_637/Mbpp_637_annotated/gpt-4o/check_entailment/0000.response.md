Correctness: **False**

The provided program checks whether the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`, returning `True` if they are equal and `False` otherwise. The problem description states that the function should determine if there is "no profit and no loss," which implies that the two values must be equal.

While the code does check for equality correctly, it does not handle any edge cases or potential issues that may arise from comparing different data types. For example, if `cost_price` is a string and `selling_price` is a number (e.g., `func_1("100", 100)`), the function will return `False`, but it does not consider this as a valid case of "no profit and no loss" because they are not directly comparable.

The annotations mention that the function simply checks for equality without addressing type comparisons. This observation reinforces the idea that the function might not behave as expected in all scenarios, particularly when data types are mixed.

Thus, since the program does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description, it is deemed incorrect.
