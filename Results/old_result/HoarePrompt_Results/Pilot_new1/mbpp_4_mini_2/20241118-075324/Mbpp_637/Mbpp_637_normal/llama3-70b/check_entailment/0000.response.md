The provided program is designed to check if the cost price and selling price are equal, which would indicate that there is no profit or loss. The implementation of the function `func_1` is straightforward; it simply compares the two input values.

Initially assessing the code against the problem description, it appears to correctly implement the requirement of checking for equality between `cost_price` and `selling_price`. If they are equal, the function returns `True`, indicating no profit or loss; otherwise, it returns `False`.

However, upon deeper inspection, there are potential edge cases that the code does not handle. The output hints mention that the function does not consider the types of inputs. For instance, if one were to pass a string and a number (e.g., `func_1(100, "100")`), the function would return `False`, but it doesn't account for the fact that this input type mismatch could be significant in a real-world scenario. The function assumes both inputs are numbers without any validation, which could lead to unexpected behavior if non-numeric types are passed.

The output hints accurately reflect the code's behavior, stating that the function will return `False` if the types differ. This reinforces the idea that the function is not robust against various input types, which could lead to incorrect assumptions about whether there is a profit or loss.

Given this analysis, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case due to its lack of type checking and handling for edge cases.

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to handle cases where the inputs are not numeric, which could lead to misleading results regarding profit and loss. For example, `func_1(100, "100")` would return `False`, even though they represent the same numerical value in a different format.
