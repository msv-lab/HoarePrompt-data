The function `func_1` is designed to check whether the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`. According to the problem description, it should return `True` if there is no profit and no loss, meaning the two prices are equal. Otherwise, it should return `False`.

Looking at the code:
```python
def func_1(cost_price, selling_price):
    return cost_price == selling_price
```
This function directly checks for equality between `cost_price` and `selling_price`, which aligns with the problem description. The assertions provided also confirm that the function behaves as expected for the given test cases.

Now, let's analyze the output hints:
- The output hints state that the function accepts two parameters, `cost_price` and `selling_price`, and returns `True` if they are equal; otherwise, it returns `False`.
- It also claims that there are no edge cases or missing logic in the implementation.

Upon reviewing both the code and the output hints, I find that they are consistent with each other. The function correctly identifies when there is no profit and no loss based on the equality of the two prices. Since the function handles the requirements stated in the problem description for all possible cases (including edge cases like zero or negative values, as equality still holds), there are no scenarios where the function fails to meet its specified behavior.

Therefore, since the code meets the problem description without any issues, I conclude:

Correctness: **True**. 

Explanation: The function accurately checks for equality between `cost_price` and `selling_price`, returning `True` for no profit/no loss scenarios and `False` otherwise. All potential cases are correctly handled as per the problem description.
