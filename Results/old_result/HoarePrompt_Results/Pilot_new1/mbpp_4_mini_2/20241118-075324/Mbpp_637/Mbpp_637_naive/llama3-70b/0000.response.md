Correctness: **True**.

The provided program correctly checks whether the given amount has no profit and no loss by comparing the cost price and selling price. The condition `cost_price == selling_price` accurately captures the requirement that there is neither profit nor loss. 

For any input where the cost price is equal to the selling price, the function will return `True`, indicating no profit and no loss, which aligns with the problem description. Conversely, if the cost price is not equal to the selling price, it will return `False`, indicating either a profit or a loss. 

Since the logic covers all potential cases as described, the program is correct.
