The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tup`. `lst` is a list, and `tup` is a tuple. After executing the function body, it returns a list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tup` converted to a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and return a new list that combines the elements of both. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst (a list) and tup (a tuple), and returns a list that is the concatenation of lst and the elements of tup converted to a list.**
