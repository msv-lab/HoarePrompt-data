Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the functionality described in the problem statement. The function `func_1` takes a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, then concatenates the list with the elements of the tuple (after converting the tuple to a list). 

The code handles all potential cases, including:
- An empty list and/or an empty tuple, which would simply return an empty list.
- A non-empty list and an empty tuple, which would return the original list.
- An empty list and a non-empty tuple, which would return a list containing the elements of the tuple.
- Both the list and tuple being non-empty, which would return a list containing all elements from both.

Since the function behaves as expected in every scenario, it meets the requirements set out in the problem description.
