Output State: **If `lst` is a list with at least 2 comparable elements, the loop checks if each element is greater than the next one. If any element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, the function returns False, indicating that the list is not in non-decreasing order. If the list has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute, and the function does not return anything, implying that the list is either empty or contains a single element, which is considered trivially sorted.**
