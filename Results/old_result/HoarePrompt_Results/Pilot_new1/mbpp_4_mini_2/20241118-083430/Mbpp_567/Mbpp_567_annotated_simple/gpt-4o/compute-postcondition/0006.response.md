Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements. If the last element of `lst` (i.e., `lst[i]`) is greater than the second-to-last element (i.e., `lst[i + 1]`), the function returns False. If `lst[i]` is less than or equal to `lst[i + 1]`, the function does not return anything, indicating that the list is in non-decreasing order at least for the last two elements.***
