Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` of comparable elements and returns True if all elements in `lst` are in non-decreasing order (i.e., each element is less than or equal to the next). If the list is empty, it will return True as there are no elements to violate the order. If any elements are not in non-decreasing order, it returns False. **
