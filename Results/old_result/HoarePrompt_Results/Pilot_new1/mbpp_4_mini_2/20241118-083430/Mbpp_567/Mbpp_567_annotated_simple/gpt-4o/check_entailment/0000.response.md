Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted in non-decreasing order. 

Here's the reasoning:

1. The function `func_1` iterates through the list `lst` using a loop that runs from the first element to the second-to-last element.
2. Inside the loop, it compares each element `lst[i]` with the next element `lst[i + 1]`.
3. If it finds any instance where `lst[i]` is greater than `lst[i + 1]`, it returns `False`, indicating that the list is not sorted.
4. If the loop completes without finding any such instance, it returns `True`, indicating that the list is sorted.

The annotations correctly describe the behavior of the code:
- The loop effectively checks for the condition of non-decreasing order.
- The function handles lists with fewer than 2 elements correctly by not executing the loop, which means such lists are considered sorted.

There are no edge cases or missing logic that would cause the program to fail for any input that adheres to the problem description. Therefore, the program is correct.
