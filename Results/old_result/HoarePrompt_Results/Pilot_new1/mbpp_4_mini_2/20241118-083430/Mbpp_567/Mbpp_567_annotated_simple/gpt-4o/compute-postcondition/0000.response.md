According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the list `lst`. For the loop to execute, `len(lst) - 1` must be at least 1, which means that `len(lst)` must be at least 2. Therefore, `lst` must contain at least 2 elements for the loop to run. 

At the start of the loop, the variable `i` should be initialized to 0, as it is the starting index of the range. 

State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements, `i` is 0**
