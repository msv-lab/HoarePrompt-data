The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of comparable elements. If `lst` is a list with at least 2 comparable elements, the function checks if each element is greater than the next one. If any element at index `i` is found to be greater than the element at index `i + 1`, the function returns `False`, indicating that the list is not in non-decreasing order. If `lst` has fewer than 2 elements, the function does not return anything, implying that the list is either empty or contains a single element, which is considered trivially sorted. If no elements violate the non-decreasing order condition, the function returns `True`, indicating that the list is in non-decreasing order.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, and returns `False` if the list is not in non-decreasing order. If the list is in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`. If the list has fewer than 2 elements, it does not return anything.**
