Functionality: ** The function accepts a list `lst` and returns `False` if any element is greater than the following element in a list of at least 2 elements. If the list has fewer than 2 elements, it does not return anything, leading to an implicit return of `None`. If the list is sorted in non-decreasing order, it returns `True`. **
