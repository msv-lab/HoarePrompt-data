Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 3 elements, and `i` is `len(lst) - 2`. If the element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, the function returns False. If `lst[i]` is less than or equal to `lst[i + 1]`, there is no return value, and the function continues execution.***
