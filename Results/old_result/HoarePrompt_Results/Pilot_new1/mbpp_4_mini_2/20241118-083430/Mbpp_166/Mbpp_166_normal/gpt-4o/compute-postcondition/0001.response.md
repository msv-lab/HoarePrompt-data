The variable `odd_count` is assigned the value of the length of `lst` minus the value of `even_count`. The length of `lst` is the total number of integers in the list, and `even_count` represents the count of even integers. Therefore, `odd_count` will represent the count of odd integers in the list. The values of `lst` and `even_count` are not changed by this operation.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst**.
