According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the value of `j` in relation to the length of `nums`. The loop starts at `j = i + 1` and continues until `j < len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 2`, which means the next value of `j` will be `i + 3`.

Since `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2`, for the loop to execute one more time, `len(nums)` must also be greater than `i + 3`. Therefore, we need to ensure that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 3`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `len(nums)` needs to be greater than `i + 3`
- `j` should be set to `i + 3` for the next iteration.

State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either even or odd, len(nums) is greater than `i + 3`, j is `i + 3`**
