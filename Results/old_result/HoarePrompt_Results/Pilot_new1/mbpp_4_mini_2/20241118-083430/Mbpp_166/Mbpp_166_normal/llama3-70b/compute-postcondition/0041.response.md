Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers are either even or odd. If `nums` is an empty list, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `nums` has only one integer, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `nums` has at least 2 integers, the loop executes for each pair of integers, and `count` is incremented by 1 for each pair that has the same parity.**
