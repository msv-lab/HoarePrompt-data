The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `nums`. `nums` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it returns the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both integers are either even or odd, which is represented by the value of `count`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `nums` and return the count of pairs of integers that are both even or both odd. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter nums, which is a list of integers, and returns the number of pairs of integers in nums that are either both even or both odd.**
