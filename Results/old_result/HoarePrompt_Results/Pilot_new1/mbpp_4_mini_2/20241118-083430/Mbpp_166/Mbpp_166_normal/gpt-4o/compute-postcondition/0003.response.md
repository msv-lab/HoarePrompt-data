The value of `odd_pairs` is assigned the result of the expression `odd_count * (odd_count - 1) // 2`. The previous value of `odd_count` is used for this calculation, but the specific value is unknown. Other variables remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`, `even_pairs` is calculated as even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2, and `odd_pairs` is calculated based on the value of `odd_count`.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`, `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`, `even_pairs` is calculated as even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2, and `odd_pairs` is calculated based on the value of `odd_count.**
