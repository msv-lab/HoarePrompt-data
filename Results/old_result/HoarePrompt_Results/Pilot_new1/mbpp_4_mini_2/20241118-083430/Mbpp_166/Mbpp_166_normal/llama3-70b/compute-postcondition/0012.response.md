According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the length of the `nums` list. The loop starts from `i + 1` and goes up to `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` has at least 2 elements, and the loop variable `j` is initialized to `i + 1`.

For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`. Since `j` starts from `i + 1`, we need to ensure that `i + 1` is less than `len(nums)`. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `j` is now `i + 1` and must be less than `len(nums)`. If `i + 1` is equal to `len(nums)`, the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to reflect that `j` is `i + 1` and `nums` still has at least 2 elements, but now we must ensure that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is such that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, and `j` is `i + 1`**
