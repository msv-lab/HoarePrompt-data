Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity (i.e., both are even or both are odd). If `nums` is empty or contains only one integer, the function returns 0, as there are no pairs to consider. **
