The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is not specified, but it is increased by 1. The states of the other variables `i` and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is increased by 1, `i` is such that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2`, `j` is `i + 2`.

Output State: **`count` is increased by 1, `i` is such that `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 2`, `j` is `i + 2**
