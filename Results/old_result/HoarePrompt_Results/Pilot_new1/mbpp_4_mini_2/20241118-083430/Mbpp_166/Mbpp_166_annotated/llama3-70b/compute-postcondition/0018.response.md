Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity. If `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` have the same parity, `count` is increased by 1. If `nums` has more than 2 elements and `nums[1]` and `nums[2]` have different parity, `count` remains unchanged.***
