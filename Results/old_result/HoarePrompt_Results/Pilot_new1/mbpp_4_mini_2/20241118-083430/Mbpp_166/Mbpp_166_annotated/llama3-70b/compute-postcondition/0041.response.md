Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity (both even or both odd). If `nums` has fewer than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `nums` has at least 2 elements, `count` will be incremented for each valid pair found. If there are no pairs with the same parity, `count` will remain unchanged after the loop completes.**
