Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity. If `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have the same parity, `count` is increased by 1. If they do not share the same parity, `count` remains unchanged. Additionally, it is ensured that `nums` has a length greater than `i + 3`, and `j` is equal to `i + 3`.***
