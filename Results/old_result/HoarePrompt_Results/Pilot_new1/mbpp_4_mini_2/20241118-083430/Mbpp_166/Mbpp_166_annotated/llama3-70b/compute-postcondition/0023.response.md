The value of `count` is incremented by 1, but the previous value of `count` is unknown. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity, and `count` is increased by 1.

Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity, and `count` is increased by 1**
