The variable `even_pairs` is assigned the value of `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`. The value of `even_count` is used to calculate `even_pairs`, but the specific value of `even_count` is not provided. Therefore, we can only express `even_pairs` in terms of `even_count`. The other variables remain unchanged. 

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`; `even_pairs` is `even_count * (even_count - 1) // 2`**
