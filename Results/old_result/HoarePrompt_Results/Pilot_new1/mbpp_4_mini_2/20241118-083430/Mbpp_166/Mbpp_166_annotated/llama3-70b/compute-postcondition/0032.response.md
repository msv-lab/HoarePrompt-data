According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `len(nums)`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2 and `j` is 3, with `len(nums)` being greater than 3. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be incremented to 4, and we need to ensure that `j` is still less than `len(nums)`. 

Since `len(nums)` is greater than 3, it is possible that `len(nums)` is at least 4, allowing `j` to be 4. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `j` is now 4.

State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `len(nums)` is greater than 4**
