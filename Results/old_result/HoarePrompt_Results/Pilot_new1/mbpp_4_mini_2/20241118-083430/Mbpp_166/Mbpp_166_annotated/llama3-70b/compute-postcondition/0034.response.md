Postcondition: ***`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity. If the integers at indices `i` (2) and `j` (4) in the list `nums` have the same parity, then `count` is incremented by 1. The list `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `len(nums)` is greater than 4. If the integers at indices 2 and 4 have different parity, `count` remains unchanged.***
