According to the code, the loop will execute based on the values of `i` and the length of `nums`. The loop starts with `j` being set to `i + 1`, which means `j` will start at 2 (since `i` is 1). 

For the loop to execute, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`. Since `nums` has at least 2 elements, `len(nums)` is at least 2. Therefore, `j` starting at 2 means that `len(nums)` must be greater than 2 for the loop to execute at least once.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
1. Ensure that `len(nums)` is greater than 2 to allow the loop to execute.
2. `j` is initialized to 2, which is `i + 1`.

State: **`count` is the number of pairs (nums[i], nums[j]) where both integers have the same parity, `i` is 1, `j` is 2, `nums` has more than 2 elements**
