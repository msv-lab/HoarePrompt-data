The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is not specified, but it represents the number of pairs where both integers have the same parity. Other variables (`nums`, `i`, `j`) are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state reflects the increment of `count`.

Output State: **`count` is incremented by 1, `nums` contains at least 2 elements, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `len(nums)` is greater than 4**
