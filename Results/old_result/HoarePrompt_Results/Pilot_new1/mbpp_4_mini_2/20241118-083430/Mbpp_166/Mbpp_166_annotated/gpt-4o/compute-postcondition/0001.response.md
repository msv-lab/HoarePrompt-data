The variable `odd_count` is assigned the value of `len(lst) - even_count`. The length of the list `lst` gives the total number of integers in the list, and subtracting `even_count` from this total provides the count of odd integers. The values of `lst` and `even_count` are not specified, but `even_count` is known to be the count of even integers within `lst`. Therefore, the output state reflects the relationship between these variables.

Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers; `even_count` is the count of even integers in `lst`; `odd_count` is the count of odd integers in `lst`.**
