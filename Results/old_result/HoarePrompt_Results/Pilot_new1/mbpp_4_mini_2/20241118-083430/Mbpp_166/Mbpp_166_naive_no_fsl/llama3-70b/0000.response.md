To determine the correctness of the provided program, we need to analyze the logic of the function `func_1` in relation to the problem description, which states that the function should count the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number.

### Analyzing the Code

1. The function uses two nested loops to iterate through all unique pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`.
2. For each pair, it checks if the result of the bitwise XOR operation `nums[i] ^ nums[j]` is even. This is done by checking if `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0`.
3. If the XOR result is even, it increments the count.
4. Finally, it returns the count of such pairs.

### Understanding XOR and Evenness

The result of `a ^ b` is even if and only if both `a` and `b` are either even or odd. This is because:
- Even ^ Even = Even
- Odd ^ Odd = Even
- Even ^ Odd = Odd
- Odd ^ Even = Odd

### Edge Cases

1. **Empty List**: If `nums` is empty, the function should return `0`, which it does correctly.
2. **Single Element List**: If `nums` contains one element, there are no pairs, and the function should return `0`, which it does correctly.
3. **All Even or All Odd**: If all numbers are even or all are odd, the function should count all pairs, which it does correctly.
4. **Mixed List**: If the list contains both odd and even integers, the function should only count pairs of the same parity, which it does correctly.

### Conclusion

The function correctly counts pairs of integers that xor to an even number based on the parity of the integers involved. I cannot find any potential case where the program does not work as expected according to the problem description.

Correctness: **True**
