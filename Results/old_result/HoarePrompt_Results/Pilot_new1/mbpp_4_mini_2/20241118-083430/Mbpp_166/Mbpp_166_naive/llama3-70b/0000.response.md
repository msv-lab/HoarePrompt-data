To determine the correctness of the provided program based on the problem description, we need to analyze whether the program correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that XOR to an even number.

### Analysis:
1. **Understanding XOR and Evenness**: 
   - The XOR of two integers is even if both integers are either even or both are odd. This is because:
     - Even XOR Even = Even
     - Odd XOR Odd = Even
     - Even XOR Odd = Odd
   - Therefore, to count pairs that XOR to an even number, we need to count pairs of even numbers and pairs of odd numbers.

2. **Program Logic**:
   - The program iterates through all pairs `(i, j)` where `i < j`.
   - It checks if `(nums[i] ^ nums[j]) % 2 == 0`, which is the correct condition for counting pairs that XOR to an even number.

3. **Potential Edge Cases**:
   - Consider a list with all even numbers (e.g., `[2, 4, 6]`), the program should count all pairs.
   - Consider a list with all odd numbers (e.g., `[1, 3, 5]`), the program should also count all pairs.
   - Consider a mixed list (e.g., `[1, 2, 3, 4]`), the program should count pairs of even numbers and pairs of odd numbers.

### Testing:
1. For an input list of all even numbers:
   ```python
   func_1([2, 4, 6])  # Expected output: 3 (pairs: (2,4), (2,6), (4,6))
   ```
2. For an input list of all odd numbers:
   ```python
   func_1([1, 3, 5])  # Expected output: 3 (pairs: (1,3), (1,5), (3,5))
   ```
3. For a mixed list:
   ```python
   func_1([1, 2, 3, 4])  # Expected output: 4 (pairs: (1,3), (2,4), (1,2), (3,4))
   ```

### Conclusion:
The program appears to correctly implement the requirement of counting pairs whose XOR results in an even number. The logic is sound, and it handles different cases without missing any edge cases.

Correctness: **True**.
