According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `j` and the length of `nums`. The loop will execute if `j` is less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i + 1`, and `nums` has at least 2 integers, which implies that `len(nums)` is at least 2. 

To determine the necessary adjustments:
1. The loop starts with `j` set to `i + 1`.
2. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`. Therefore, `j` should be adjusted to `i + 2` (moving to the next integer).
3. Since `j` is now `i + 2`, we also need to ensure that `len(nums)` is at least `i + 2` to allow the loop to continue.

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `len(nums)` must be at least `i + 2`.

State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least `i + 2` integers, j is `i + 2`**
