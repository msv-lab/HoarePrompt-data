According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `j` and the length of `nums`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `len(nums)`. At the end of the last iteration, `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, which means `j` can start from `i + 1` and go up to `len(nums) - 1`. 

Since `i` is `k + 1`, the next value for `j` will be `k + 2`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `len(nums)`, which means `len(nums)` must be greater than `k + 2`. 

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `len(nums)` must be greater than `k + 2`
- `j` should be `k + 2` as it's the next value in the iteration.

State: **`count` remains unchanged unless the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, in which case `count` is incremented by 1, `len(nums)` is greater than `k + 2`, `j` is `k + 2`**
