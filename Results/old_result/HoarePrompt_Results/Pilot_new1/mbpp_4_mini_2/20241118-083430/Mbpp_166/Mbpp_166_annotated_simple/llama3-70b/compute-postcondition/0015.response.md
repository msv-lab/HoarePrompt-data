According to the code, the loop iterates over the variable `j` starting from `i + 1` to `len(nums) - 1`. For the loop to execute, `i + 1` must be less than `len(nums)`. Given that `i` is equal to `len(nums)`, `i + 1` would be `len(nums) + 1`, which is greater than `len(nums) - 1`. Therefore, the loop cannot execute since the starting point of `j` is outside the valid range.

To allow the loop to execute, `i` must be adjusted to be less than `len(nums) - 1`, so that `i + 1` is at most `len(nums) - 1`. This means `i` should be set to `len(nums) - 2` or less.

State: **`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])`, `len(nums)` is greater than 1, `i` is less than or equal to `len(nums) - 2`**
