Postcondition: ***`count` represents the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` such that the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, `j` is `i + 2`, and `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 3`. If the XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, `count` is incremented by 1; otherwise, `count` remains unchanged. This accounts for the case where both `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` are even or both are odd, resulting in an even XOR. If `len(nums)` is not greater than `i + 3`, the condition is not evaluated.***
