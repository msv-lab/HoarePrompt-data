Output State: **`count` is the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` have the same parity (both even or both odd). If `len(nums)` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `len(nums)` is 2, the loop executes once and increments `count` by 1 if the XOR is even, otherwise `count` remains unchanged. If `len(nums)` is greater than 2, the loop will execute multiple times, and `count` will reflect the total number of valid pairs found.**
