The function accepts a list of integers and counts the number of pairs of even integers and pairs of odd integers within the list. It returns the total count of these pairs. Specifically, it calculates the number of ways to select two even integers and two odd integers from the list and sums these counts. The function handles cases where the list may be empty or contain only even or odd integers, returning 0 in those cases since no pairs can be formed.
