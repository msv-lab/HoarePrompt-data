Functionality: ** The function accepts a list of integers `nums` and returns the total number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` where both integers have the same parity (both are even or both are odd). If the length of `nums` is less than 2, it returns 0 since no pairs can be formed. The function correctly counts pairs based on the parity of the integers but does not explicitly check for edge cases related to empty lists or lists with a single element. **
