The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`. `lst` is a list of integers. After executing the function body, it calculates the sum of `even_pairs` and `odd_pairs` derived from `even_count` and `odd_count`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of integers `lst` and return the sum of pairs of even and odd counts derived from the integers in the list.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter lst, which is a list of integers, and returns the sum of even_pairs and odd_pairs calculated from even_count and odd_count.**
