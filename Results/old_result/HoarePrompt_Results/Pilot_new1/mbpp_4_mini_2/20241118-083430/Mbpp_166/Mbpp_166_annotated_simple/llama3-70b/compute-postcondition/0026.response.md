Output State: **`count` represents the number of pairs `(nums[i], nums[j])` such that the bitwise XOR of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, indicating that both numbers are either even or odd. If `len(nums)` is greater than `i + 1`, the loop will execute at least once, with `j` starting from `i + 1`. If `len(nums)` is equal to `i + 1`, the loop will not execute, and `count` remains unchanged. If `len(nums)` is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute, and `count` remains at its initial value.**
