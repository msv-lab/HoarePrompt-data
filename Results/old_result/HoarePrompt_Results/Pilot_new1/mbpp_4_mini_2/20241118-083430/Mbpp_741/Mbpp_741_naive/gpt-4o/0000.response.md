Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when the input string is empty. According to the problem description, the function should check whether all characters in the string are the same. However, the function returns `True` for an empty string, which is not consistent with the idea of checking uniformity of characters. An empty string does not have any characters, so it cannot be said that all characters are the same. 

For example:
- `func_1('')` should return `False` instead of `True`. 

Thus, the program fails to meet the requirements of the problem description for this case.
