According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. The loop iterates over each character in `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and `char` is the character that follows `first_char` in `s`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be updated to the next character in `s`. Since `char` is currently the character that follows `first_char`, we need to ensure that `char` now refers to the next character in the string. 

Therefore, to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `char` is now the next character in `s`, and `first_char` remains the same. The loop will continue until all characters in `s` have been processed.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the character that follows the current `char` in `s`**
