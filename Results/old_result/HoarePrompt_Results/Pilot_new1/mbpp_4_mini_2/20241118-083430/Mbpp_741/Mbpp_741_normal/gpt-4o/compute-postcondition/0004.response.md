According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is empty, an IndexError will occur, which means `s` must contain at least one character for the loop to execute. Additionally, if `s` contains characters, `first_char` is assigned the first character of `s`. Therefore, for the loop to be executed, `s` must contain at least one character, and `char` should be the first character in `s`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the first character of `s`**
