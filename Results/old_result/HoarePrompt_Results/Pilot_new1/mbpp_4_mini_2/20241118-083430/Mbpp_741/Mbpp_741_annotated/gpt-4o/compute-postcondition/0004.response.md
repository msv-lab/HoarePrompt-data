According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is an empty string, the loop will not execute. To ensure the loop executes, `s` must contain at least one character. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string containing characters, and `first_char` is the first character of `s`. So for the loop to be executed, `s` must be a non-empty string, and `char` will be the first character of `s` during the first iteration.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is `first_char`**
