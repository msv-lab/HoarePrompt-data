Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly handle the case of an empty string. According to the problem description, the function should check whether all characters in the input string are the same. The implementation returns `True` for an empty string, which is not a valid case based on the requirement. An empty string should logically return `False` because there are no characters to compare, hence it does not satisfy the condition of "all characters being the same."

Additionally, the assertions provided in the program are incorrect. The assertion `assert func_1('python') == False` should return `True` since not all characters in "python" are the same, but the code would return `False` for that case. Thus, this also indicates that the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
