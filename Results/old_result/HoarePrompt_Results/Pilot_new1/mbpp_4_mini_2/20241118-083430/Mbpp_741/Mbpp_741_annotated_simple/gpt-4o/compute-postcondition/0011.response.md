According to the code, the loop execution depends on the string `s`. Since `s` is a non-empty string, the loop will iterate over its characters. At the end of the last iteration, we have `s` as a non-empty string, `first_char` as the first character of `s`, and `char` as the second character of `s`. 

To determine the state at the start of the next iteration, we need to consider the current character `char`. Since the loop iterates over each character in the string `s`, after the last iteration where `char` is the second character, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` must be updated to the third character of `s`, and the index of the loop would increment accordingly. 

Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `char` is now the third character of `s`, and the loop will continue until all characters in `s` have been processed.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `first_char` is the first character of `s`, `char` is the third character of `s`**
