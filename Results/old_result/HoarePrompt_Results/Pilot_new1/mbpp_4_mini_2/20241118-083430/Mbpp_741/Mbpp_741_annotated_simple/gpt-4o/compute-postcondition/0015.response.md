Output State: **If `s` is a non-empty string, then `first_char` is the first character of `s`, and the loop will execute for each character in `s`. If any character `char` is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns False, indicating that not all characters in `s` are the same. If all characters are equal to `first_char`, the loop completes without returning, and the function implicitly returns None. If `s` is empty, the function immediately returns True, and the loop does not execute.**
