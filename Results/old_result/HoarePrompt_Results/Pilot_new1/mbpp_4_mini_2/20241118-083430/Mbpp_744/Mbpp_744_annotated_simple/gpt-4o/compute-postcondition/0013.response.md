The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`. `tup` is a tuple that can contain any type of elements, including None. 

- Case 1: If `tup` is a tuple containing at least one element, the function checks each element to see if any `item` is None. If it finds an `item` that is None, the function returns `True`. If the loop completes without finding None, the function does not return anything (implicitly returns None). If `tup` is an empty tuple, the loop does not execute, and the function also does not return anything (implicitly returns None).
  
- Case 2: The program returns `False`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return `True` if any element in the tuple is None; if the tuple is empty or does not contain None, it implicitly returns None. Additionally, it can return `False` under certain unspecified conditions.

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup, returns True if any element in tup is None; if tup is empty or does not contain None, it implicitly returns None. Additionally, it may return False under certain conditions.**
