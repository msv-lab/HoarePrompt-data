Correctness: **False**

The provided program is supposed to check if a given tuple contains any `None` values. However, it has a flaw in its logic regarding the return value when the tuple is empty. 

Hereâ€™s a breakdown of the issues:

1. If the tuple is empty (i.e., `tup = ()`), the loop does not execute, and the function implicitly returns `None`. This does not align with the expected behavior described in the problem statement, which should ideally return `False` for an empty tuple (indicating that there are no `None` values).

2. The program correctly identifies `None` values in non-empty tuples, returning `True` when a `None` is found and `False` otherwise. However, since it does not handle the empty tuple case correctly, it fails to meet the problem requirements for all potential inputs.

Thus, the program does not work as expected for the case of an empty tuple, leading to the conclusion that the correctness is **False**.
