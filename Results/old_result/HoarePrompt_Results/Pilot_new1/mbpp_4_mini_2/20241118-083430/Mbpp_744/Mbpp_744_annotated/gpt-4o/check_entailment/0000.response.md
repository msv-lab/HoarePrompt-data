Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not meet the problem description for every potential case. Specifically, the function does not handle the case when the input tuple `tup` is empty. According to the annotations, if `tup` is empty, the loop will not execute, and the function will not return anything, leaving the state unchanged. This means that the function does not explicitly return a value for an empty tuple, leading to an undefined return value.

The problem description states that the function should check if the given tuple has any `None` value or not, and it should return a boolean value (`True` or `False`) for all inputs, including an empty tuple. Therefore, the function fails to comply with the requirement of returning `False` for an empty tuple, which is a clear violation of the problem description.

The annotations correctly point out this issue, confirming that the function does not behave as expected when `tup` is empty. Hence, the function is incorrect.
