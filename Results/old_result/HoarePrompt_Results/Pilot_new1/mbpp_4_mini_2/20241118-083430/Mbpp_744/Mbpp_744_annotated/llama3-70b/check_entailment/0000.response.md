To determine the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze the problem description and the annotated code.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that checks if a given tuple contains any `None` values. If it does, the function should return `True`; otherwise, it should return `False`.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(tup):
    return any(x is None for x in tup)
    # The program returns True if any element in the tuple 'tup' is None, otherwise it returns False
```

### Analysis:
1. **Function Logic**: The function uses a generator expression within the `any()` function to check each element of the tuple `tup`. The expression `x is None` evaluates to `True` if an element is `None`, and `any()` will return `True` if at least one element satisfies this condition.

2. **Edge Cases**: The annotations state that the function does not handle any specific edge cases beyond checking for `None` values. However, the problem description does not mention any specific edge cases either. 

3. **Behavior with Different Inputs**:
   - If `tup` is an empty tuple `()`, the function will return `False`, which is correct since there are no elements to be `None`.
   - If `tup` contains elements that are not `None`, like `(1, 2, 3)`, the function will return `False`, which is also correct.
   - If `tup` contains at least one `None`, like `(1, None, 3)`, the function will return `True`, which is correct.

### Conclusion:
The function correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks for `None` values in the tuple and returns the expected results for all potential cases, including edge cases like empty tuples. 

Since the code adheres to the problem description and handles all cases correctly, I conclude that:

Correctness: **True** 

The function is correct because it successfully identifies whether any element in the tuple is `None`, fulfilling the requirements set out in the problem description.
