The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_dict`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. The parameter `student_dict` is a dictionary where the keys are strings representing student names, and the values are tuples containing two floats (student_height, student_weight). The parameters `min_height` and `min_weight` are floats representing the minimum height and weight, respectively. After executing the function body, it returns a dictionary of students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to filter and return a dictionary of students based on their height and weight compared to the specified minimum values.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary of students and their respective heights and weights, along with minimum height and weight values, and returns a dictionary of students who meet or exceed the specified height and weight criteria.**
