The function accepts a dictionary `student_dict` where keys are student names and values are tuples containing their height and weight. It also accepts two integers, `min_height` and `min_weight`. The function returns a new dictionary containing only those students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. If no students meet the criteria, an empty dictionary is returned.
