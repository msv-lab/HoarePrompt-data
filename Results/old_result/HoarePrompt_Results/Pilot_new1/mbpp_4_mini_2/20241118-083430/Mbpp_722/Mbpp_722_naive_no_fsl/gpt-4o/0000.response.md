Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly filters students based on their height and weight compared to the specified minimum values. The logic implemented in the function `func_1` uses a dictionary comprehension that iterates over each student in the input dictionary. It checks if both the height and weight of each student are greater than or equal to the provided minimum values. 

The assertions provided in the code serve as test cases, and they demonstrate that the function behaves as expected for the given inputs:

1. In the first assertion, only "Cierra Vega" meets the criteria of height >= 6.0 and weight >= 70, which is correctly returned.
2. In the second assertion, both "Cierra Vega" and "Kierra Gentry" meet the criteria of height >= 5.9 and weight >= 67, which is also correctly returned.
3. In the third assertion, all students meet the criteria of height >= 5.7 and weight >= 64, which is accurately returned.

Since all provided test cases pass and there are no identified edge cases or missing logic in the function that would lead to incorrect behavior, the program is correct.
