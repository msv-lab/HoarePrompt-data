To assess the correctness of the provided Python program against the problem description, let's break it down step by step.

**Problem Description:**
The function is supposed to filter students from a dictionary based on their height and weight, ensuring that both measurements exceed specified minimum thresholds.

**Program Analysis:**
The function `func_1` is defined as follows:
```python
def func_1(student_dict, min_height, min_weight):
    return {name: (height, weight) for (name, (height, weight)) in student_dict.items() if height >= min_height and weight >= min_weight}
```
This function is using dictionary comprehension to create a new dictionary containing only those students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`.

**Initial Assessment:**
- The function appears to fulfill the requirement of filtering students based on height and weight.
- However, it does not handle edge cases such as:
  - An empty input dictionary (`student_dict`).
  - Non-numeric height or weight values, which could lead to a TypeError if, for example, the input dictionary contains string representations of numbers or other types.

**Output Hints:**
The output hints state that the function will return a new dictionary containing only those students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`. It also mentions that the function does not handle cases where the input dictionary is empty or where height or weight values are not numeric.

**Agreement Check:**
The output hints align with the function's logic regarding filtering based on height and weight. However, they also highlight the function's failure to manage edge cases effectively.

**Conclusion:**
Since the code does not handle cases where the input dictionary is empty or where the height or weight values are not numeric, it does not meet the problem description's requirements for every potential case. Therefore, the function is incorrect.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Example of Incorrectness:** If we call `func_1({}, 6.0, 70)`, the function will return an empty dictionary, which is acceptable, but if we pass a dictionary with non-numeric values, for instance, `func_1({'John Doe': ('six', 'seventy')}, 6.0, 70)`, it will raise a TypeError because it attempts to compare strings with floats. This shows that the function does not handle all edge cases as required.
