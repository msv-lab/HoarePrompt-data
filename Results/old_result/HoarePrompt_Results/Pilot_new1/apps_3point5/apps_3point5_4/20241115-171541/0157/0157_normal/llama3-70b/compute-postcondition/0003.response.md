Example Answer:
`min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers, so after execution, `min_lemon` will hold the minimum value among these three calculated values. 
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `min_lemon` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
