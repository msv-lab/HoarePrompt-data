Example Answer: 
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The value of `a` is between 1 and 1000, and the values of `b` and `c` are unknown. The value of `b` is halved and the value of `c` is divided by 4 to calculate `max_lemons`. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer where 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`**
