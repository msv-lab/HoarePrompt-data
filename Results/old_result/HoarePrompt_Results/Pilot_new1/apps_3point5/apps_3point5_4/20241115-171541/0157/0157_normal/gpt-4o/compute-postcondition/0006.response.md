The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to calculate the sum of squares of the integers a, b, and c where a, b, and c are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000. The function then returns the result of this calculation. 
Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of squares of three positive integers a, b, and c, where 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, and returns the result.**
