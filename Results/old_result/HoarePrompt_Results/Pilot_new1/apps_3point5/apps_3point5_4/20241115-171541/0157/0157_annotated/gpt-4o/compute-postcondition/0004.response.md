Example Answer: 
`max_lemons` is calculated as the minimum value among a/2, b/2, and c/4. `total_fruits` is calculated as the sum of max_lemons multiplied by 1, 2, and 4. 
Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among a/2, b/2, and c/4, `total_fruits` is the calculated total number of fruits.
Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer such that 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among a/2, b/2, and c/4, `total_fruits` is the calculated total number of fruits**
