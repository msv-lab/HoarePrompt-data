Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote based on the given ratio of 1:2:4. The program calculates the maximum number of lemons based on the minimum of the ratios of lemons, apples, and pears, and then calculates the total number of fruits accordingly. The logic follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases, including the edge cases where Nikolay may not have enough pears to cook any compote. Therefore, the program is correct.
