Output State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`, `k` are all integers. The loop will execute for each `num` in the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. If `l` is greater than `r`, the loop does not execute and `total_sum` remains 0.**
