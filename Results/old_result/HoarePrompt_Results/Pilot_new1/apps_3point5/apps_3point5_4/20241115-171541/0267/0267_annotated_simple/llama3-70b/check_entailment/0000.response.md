Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code defines two functions, `func_1` and `count`, to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits.
2. The `count` function uses dynamic programming to store and retrieve intermediate results, optimizing the calculation process.
3. The `func_1` function calculates the result as the difference between the count of numbers up to `r` and the count of numbers up to `l-1`, then takes the result modulo `998244353`.
4. The code logic aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
5. Since there are no identified cases where the code does not work as expected, the correctness is determined to be True.
