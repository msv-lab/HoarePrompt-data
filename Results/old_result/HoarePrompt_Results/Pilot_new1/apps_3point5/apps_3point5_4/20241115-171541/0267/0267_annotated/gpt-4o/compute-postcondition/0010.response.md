Postcondition: ***total_sum is an integer. If func_1(num, k) evaluates to true for the next num, total_sum is updated to the result of (total_sum + num) % MOD. Otherwise, total_sum remains unchanged. This ensures that total_sum is correctly modified based on the condition of func_1(num, k) and the value of num, while maintaining its integrity in all other cases.***
