According to the code, the loop will execute if k is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, n is a non-negative integer and k is a positive integer, so we need to adjust the state to ensure that the loop can execute. Therefore, the adjusted state before the loop starts should be: n is a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary storing previously calculated values where dp[n, k] is assigned the value 9.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, dp is a dictionary storing previously calculated values with dp[n, k] assigned the value 9**
