Example Answer:
The expression `dp[n, k] %= MOD` updates the value of `dp[n, k]` by taking the modulo of the current value with `MOD`. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not impacted by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, dp[n, k] is updated by taking modulo with MOD.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is greater than 1, dp[n, k] is updated by taking modulo with MOD**
