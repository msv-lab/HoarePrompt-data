Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program reads the input correctly, extracts all unique digits from the cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, and then constructs the maximum number that Masha can make. This logic covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. There are no edge cases or scenarios mentioned in the problem description where the program fails to produce the correct output. Hence, the program is correct.
