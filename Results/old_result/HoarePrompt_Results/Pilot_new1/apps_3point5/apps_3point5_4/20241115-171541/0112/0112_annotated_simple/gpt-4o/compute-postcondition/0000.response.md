Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of individual digits of the number `num`. The value of `num` is not given in the initial state, so the output state is: n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube; digits is a list of individual digits of an unknown number.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube; digits is a list of individual digits of an unknown number**
