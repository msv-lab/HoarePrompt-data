Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to determine the maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes. It iterates through all the numbers from 1 to x and checks if each number can be formed using the available cubes. The function `can_form_number` checks if a given number can be formed using the faces of the cubes. The program correctly handles the case where Masha can't make a number due to the unavailability of certain digits on the cubes. The program uses sets to store the faces of each cube, making it easier to check for the presence of a digit. Overall, the program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
