Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input, extracts all unique digits from the cubes, removes '0' if it exists, sorts the digits in descending order, and then converts them to form the maximum number that Masha can make. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description as it finds the maximum number that can be formed using the given cubes. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected based on the problem requirements.
