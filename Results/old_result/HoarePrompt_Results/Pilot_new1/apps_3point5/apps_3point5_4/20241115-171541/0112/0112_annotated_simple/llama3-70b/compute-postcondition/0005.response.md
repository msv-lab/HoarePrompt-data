According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the cubes list has at least 2 sublists, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of sublists with at least 1 sublist, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first sublist of the cubes list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the cubes list must have at least 2 sublists.
State: **n is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of sublists with at least 2 sublists, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first sublist of the cubes list**
