The function `can_form_number` accepts three parameters: `n`, `cube_faces`, and `num`. `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the faces of the cube, and `num` is a positive integer representing the number to be checked for formation using the cube faces. 

After executing the function body, the function will iterate through the cube_faces to check if there is at least one unused cube with the specified digit in its faces. If such a cube is found, the corresponding value in used_cubes will be set to True, found will be set to True, and the loop will break. The loop will execute at most n times, depending on the number of cubes available. If no cube with the specified digit is found, found will remain False and used_cubes will not be modified. 

After the execution of the if-else block, if found is False, the program returns False. If there is no cube available or the digits list is empty, the loop will not execute, and the output will be the same as the initial state. 

In Case 2, the program returns True. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept the parameters `n`, `cube_faces`, and `num`, iterate through the cube faces to check if the specified digit can be formed using the cube faces, and return True if the digit can be formed, and False otherwise.
