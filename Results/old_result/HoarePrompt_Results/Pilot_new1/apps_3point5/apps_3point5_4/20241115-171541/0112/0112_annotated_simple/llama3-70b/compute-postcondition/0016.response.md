The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function reads input from the user for n number of cubes, where n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3. Each cube contains 6 integers representing the digits on each face, where each digit is between 0 and 9. The function then processes the input cubes and returns the total sum of all the digits on all faces of the cubes.
