According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an integer representing the number of cubes between 1 and 3, cube_faces is a list of n lists, used_cubes is a list of n booleans with at least one element set to True, and found is True. One of the cubes (indexed by i) that has not been used yet contains the digit in its faces, and the corresponding element in used_cubes is set to True.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following need to be adjusted:
- `n` should be adjusted to ensure that the loop can execute again, so it should be greater than the current value of `n`.
- `used_cubes` should be adjusted to ensure that there is at least one element set to False, indicating an unused cube.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **n is an integer representing the number of cubes, such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 4; cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, each integer in cube_faces is between 0 and 9 (inclusive); used_cubes is a list of n booleans with at least one element set to False; found is True**
