Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer, cube_faces is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers, num is a positive integer, digits is a list of string representations of the integer num with at least 1 digit, used_cubes is a list of n boolean values. If not used_cubes[i] and digit is in cube_faces[i], then the ith value in used_cubes is set to True and found is set to True. The program breaks out of the loop when i is less than n.***
