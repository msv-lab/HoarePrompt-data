Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values, creates a list of cubes represented by lists of integers, extracts individual digits from the cubes, removes '0' from the set of digits if present, sorts the digits in descending order, concatenates them to form a number, and then prints the maximum number formed from the digits.**
