The function `can_form_number` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer representing the number of cubes, and `cube_faces`, a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube. 

The function has two cases:
Case 1: If n is greater than 0, the function iterates through each digit in the list 'digits' and checks if the digit is present in any of the cube_faces. If the digit is found in any cube_faces, the corresponding index in 'used_cubes' is set to True, and 'found' is set to True. If the digit is not found in any cube_faces, 'found' remains False. If 'found' is False after the loop completes, the function returns False. If 'n' is 0, the loop does not execute.

Case 2: The function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept a positive integer `n` representing the number of cubes and a list of n lists `cube_faces` representing the numbers on the faces of the cubes. The function then checks if any digit is present in the cube_faces and returns True if any digit is found, otherwise it returns False.
