According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `cubes`. If the list of cubes contains at least 3 cubes, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 1, 2, or 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 2 cubes obtained from user input split by spaces for each iteration of the range of `n`; `digits` is a set containing the individual digits extracted from the cubes. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list of cubes must contain at least 3 cubes.
State: **`n` is 1, 2, or 3; `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 3 cubes obtained from user input split by spaces for each iteration of the range of `n`; `digits` is a set containing the individual digits extracted from the cubes**
