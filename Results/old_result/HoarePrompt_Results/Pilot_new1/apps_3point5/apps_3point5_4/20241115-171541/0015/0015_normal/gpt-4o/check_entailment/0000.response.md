Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code follows the problem description for every potential case. 
- If Vasya's favorite number `b` is equal to the first element of the sequence `a`, it prints 'YES', which is correct.
- If the difference between any two neighboring elements in the sequence is 0, it prints 'NO', which is also correct.
- If the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements `c` and the result is non-negative, it prints 'YES', which is accurate.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it prints 'NO', which aligns with the problem description. 

Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases based on the problem description.
