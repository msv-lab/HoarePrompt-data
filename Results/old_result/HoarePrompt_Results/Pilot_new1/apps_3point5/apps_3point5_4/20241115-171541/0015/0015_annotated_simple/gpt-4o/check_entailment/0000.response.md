Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes three integers as input representing the first element of the sequence, Vasya's favorite number, and the difference between neighboring elements.
2. It then checks if Vasya's favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence, in which case it prints "YES".
3. If the favorite number is not equal to the first element, it further checks if the difference between the favorite number and the first element is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements, and if the result is greater than or equal to 0. If both conditions are met, it prints "YES", otherwise it prints "NO".
4. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and handles edge cases such as when the difference between neighboring elements is 0.

Overall, the program logic aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases, making it correct.
