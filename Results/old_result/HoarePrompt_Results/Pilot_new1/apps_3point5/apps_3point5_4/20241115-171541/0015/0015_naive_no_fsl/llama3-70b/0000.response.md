Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly handles the case where the difference between neighboring elements is 0. In this case, it checks if the favorite number b is equal to the first element a, and if so, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
2. The program also correctly handles the case where the difference between neighboring elements is not 0. It calculates the difference between b and a, checks if it is divisible by c, and if the result is non-negative. If both conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise 'NO'.
3. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
