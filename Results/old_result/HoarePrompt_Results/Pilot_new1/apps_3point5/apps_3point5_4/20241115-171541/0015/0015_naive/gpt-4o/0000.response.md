Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly checks if Vasya's favorite number appears in the sequence as described in the problem statement. It covers all potential cases such as when the favorite number is equal to the first element of the sequence, when the difference between neighboring elements is 0, and when the favorite number can be obtained by adding multiples of the difference to the first element. The logic in the program is sound and covers all possible scenarios, hence the correctness of the program is true.
