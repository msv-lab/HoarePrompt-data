Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the specified range. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is equal to `b`, then 'YES' is printed. If `c` is equal to 0 and `a` is not equal to `b`, then 'NO' is printed. If ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed. If ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is false, 'NO' is printed. This covers all possible scenarios of the program and determines the final output based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c` after the if else block executes.***
