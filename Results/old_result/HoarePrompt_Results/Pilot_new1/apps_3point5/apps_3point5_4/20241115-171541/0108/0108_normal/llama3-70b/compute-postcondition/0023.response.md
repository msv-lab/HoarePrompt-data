According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the presence of the character `char` in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `res` contains all characters in alphabetical order including the last letter in the alphabet and the next letter in the alphabet that is missing in `s`, plus the missing letter `char`. For the loop to execute one more time, the missing letter `char` needs to be added to `s`.
State: **`res` contains all characters in alphabetical order including the last letter in the alphabet and the next letter in the alphabet that is missing in `s`, plus the missing letter `char` is in `s`**
