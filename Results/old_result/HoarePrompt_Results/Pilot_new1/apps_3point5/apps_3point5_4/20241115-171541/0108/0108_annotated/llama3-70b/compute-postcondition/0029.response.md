Example Answer:
The value of `char` is concatenated to the end of the value of `res`. The previous values of `res`, `char`, and `s` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` may have been modified with replacements, `res` is updated with the replaced characters, `char` is still in `s`.
Output State: **`s` may have been modified with replacements, `res` is updated with the replaced characters, `char` is still in `s`**
