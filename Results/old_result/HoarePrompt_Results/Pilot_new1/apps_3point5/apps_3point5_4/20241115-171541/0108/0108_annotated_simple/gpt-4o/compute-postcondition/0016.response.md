According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `target`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` + 2 and `j` is less than 27 or `j` is less than 26 and `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then the loop can execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of `s` + 2, and `j` is less than 27 or `j` is less than 26 and `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `i` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next index in `s`.
2. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` should be increased by 1.
3. If `j` reaches 26, it should be reset to 0 because the target length is 26.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of `s` + 3, `j` is less than 27 or `j` is less than 26 and `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`**
