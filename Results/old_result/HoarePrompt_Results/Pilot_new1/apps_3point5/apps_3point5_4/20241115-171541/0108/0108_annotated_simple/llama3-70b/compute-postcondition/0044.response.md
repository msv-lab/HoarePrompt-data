Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string `s` from the user and iterates through the alphabet. For each letter in the alphabet, it appends that letter to the result string `res` as many times as it appears in `s`, while replacing each occurrence of the letter in `s` with the next letter in the alphabet. If all letters from 'a' to 'z' are present in `s`, `res` will contain each letter repeated according to their occurrences in `s`, in alphabetical order, and the updated `s` will have each occurrence replaced by the next letter. If 'a' is missing in `s`, `res` will be empty, `s` will remain unchanged, and the loop will not execute. The function then checks if the length of `res` is 26, and if so, it prints `res`; otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
