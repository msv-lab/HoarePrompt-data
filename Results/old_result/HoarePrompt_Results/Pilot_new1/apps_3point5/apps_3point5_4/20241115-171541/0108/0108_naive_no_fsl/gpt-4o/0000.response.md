Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly iterates through the input string and the target string to check if the input string can be transformed into the target string by replacing characters. If it can, it prints the target string, otherwise, it prints -1. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and for all potential cases, it either prints the transformed string or -1.
