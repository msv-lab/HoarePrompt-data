Example Answer: 
The value of `char` is appended to the end of `res`. The previous values of `res` and `char` are unknown, so the output state is: `s` has been modified with replacements, `res` is updated with the replaced characters, `char` is still in `s`.
Output State: **`s` has been modified with replacements, `res` is updated with the replaced characters, `char` is still in `s`**
