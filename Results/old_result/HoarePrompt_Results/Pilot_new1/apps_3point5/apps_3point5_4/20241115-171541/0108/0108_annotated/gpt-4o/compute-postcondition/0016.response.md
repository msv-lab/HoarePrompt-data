According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if both `i` is less than the length of string `s` and `j` is less than the length of the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 1. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than the length of string `s` after incrementing. The value of `j` depends on the comparison of `s[i]` and `target[j]`, so it may or may not be incremented. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of |s| small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and `j` may or may not be incremented based on the comparison of `s[i]` and `target[j]**.
