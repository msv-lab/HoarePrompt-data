According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `target`. The loop can execute again if `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than 26. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of `s` + 1, and `j` is less than 27. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- Increment `i` by 1.
- If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, increment `j` by 1.

State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of `s` + 2, `j` is less than 27 or `j` is less than 26 and `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`.**
