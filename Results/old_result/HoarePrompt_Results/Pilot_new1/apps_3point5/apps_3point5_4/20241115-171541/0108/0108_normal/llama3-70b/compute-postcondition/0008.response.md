Example Answer:
The character `char` in the string `s` is replaced by the next letter in the alphabet using `ord` and `chr` functions. The replacement is done only once. The variable `res` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with one character replaced by the next letter in the alphabet, `res` is a string with an additional character.
Output State: **`s` is a string with one character replaced by the next letter in the alphabet, `res` is a string with an additional character**
