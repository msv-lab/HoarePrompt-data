Example Answer:
The value of `char` is added to `res`, which already contains the next character in the alphabet after the previous value of `char`. Therefore, the new value of `res` will be updated with the next character in the alphabet after the new `char`. The variable `s` remains unaffected.
Output State: **`res` is updated with the next character in the alphabet after the new `char`, `s` is not affected**
