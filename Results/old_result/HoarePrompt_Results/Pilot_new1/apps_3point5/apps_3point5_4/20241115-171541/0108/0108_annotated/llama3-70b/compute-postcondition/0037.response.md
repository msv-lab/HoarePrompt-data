Output State: **If `s` contains at least one occurrence of any character in `alphabet`, `s` is modified with replacements, `res` is updated with the replaced characters. If `s` does not contain any character in `alphabet`, `res` is updated with the concatenation of all the replaced characters. If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute, and `res` remains an empty string.**
