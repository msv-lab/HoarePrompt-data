According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `char` is in `s` with the next character in ASCII sequence, and `res` has the updated value after adding `char` to it. To execute the loop one more time, the `char` variable needs to be adjusted to the character in `s` following the current `char`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`char` is in `s` with the character following the current `char`, `res` has the updated value after adding the new `char` to it**
