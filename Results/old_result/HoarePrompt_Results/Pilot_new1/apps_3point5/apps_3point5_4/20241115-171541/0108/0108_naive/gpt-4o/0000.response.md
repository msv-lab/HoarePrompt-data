Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly iterates through the input string `s` and the target string `target` to check if the characters in `s` can form the English alphabet as a subsequence. If it successfully forms the subsequence, it prints the target string, otherwise, it prints -1. The logic of the program is sound and covers all potential cases.
