Example Answer:
The code adds the value of `remainder` to the set `seen`. The variables `n`, `k`, `i`, and `remainder` remain unchanged. If the value of `remainder` is already in `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits; otherwise, it continues. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k` are integers where `k` is positive, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`.
Output State: **`n`, `k` are integers where `k` is positive, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i**`.
