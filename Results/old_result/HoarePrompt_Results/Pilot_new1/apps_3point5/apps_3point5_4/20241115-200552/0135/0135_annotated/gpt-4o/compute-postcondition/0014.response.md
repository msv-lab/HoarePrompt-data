Output State: **If k is greater than or equal to n, the loop does not execute. If k is less than n, the loop checks for unique remainders of n divided by i for i ranging from 1 to k. If a repeated remainder is found, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the loop adds each unique remainder to the set seen_remainders.**
