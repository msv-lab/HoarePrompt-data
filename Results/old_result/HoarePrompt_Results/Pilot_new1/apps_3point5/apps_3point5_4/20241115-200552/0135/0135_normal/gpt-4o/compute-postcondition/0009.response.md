According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than `k`, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, and `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by i. Since the loop is iterating from 1 to k inclusive, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 â‰¤ n, k â‰¤ 10^18 and n > k. `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by i**
