The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The functionality of the function is to return the result of the expression (n + k) * (n - k). The values of n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the function calculates the result of the expression (n + k) * (n - k) where n and k are within the specified constraints. 
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the result of the expression (n + k) * (n - k) where n and k are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.**
