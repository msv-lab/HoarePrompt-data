According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `k` is assigned a valid value greater than or equal to 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **`n` is assigned a valid value, `k` is assigned a valid value greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 4, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 3, and `remainder` is added to `seen**.
