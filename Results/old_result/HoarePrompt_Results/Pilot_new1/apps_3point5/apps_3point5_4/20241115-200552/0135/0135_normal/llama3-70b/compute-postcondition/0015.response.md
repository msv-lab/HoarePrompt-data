According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is assigned a valid value, `k` is assigned a valid value greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 2. If the value of `remainder` is already present in the set `seen`, the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, `seen` is updated by adding `remainder`.

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`n` is assigned a valid value, `k` is assigned a valid value greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by 2**
