Example Answer:
`b_floor` is assigned the value `(b - 1) % m + 1`, where `b` is assigned based on the input. The value of `b_floor` depends on the input values of `b` and `m`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(a - 1) % m + 1`, `a_block` is calculated as `(a - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`**
