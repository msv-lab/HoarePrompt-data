Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, calculates various time values based on the input, and prints the sum of the calculated minimum block time and minimum floor time. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. It handles scenarios where `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor` and vice versa, ensuring correct time calculations.**
