Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, `m`, `k`, `n` are integers. `a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input split into integers. `a_floor` is calculated based on the unknown values of `a` and `m`, `a_block` is calculated based on the values of `a`, `m`, and `k`, `b_floor` is calculated as `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block` is calculated as `(b - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `min_block_time` is calculated as `min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. The program fragment calculates `min_floor_time` based on the comparison of `a_floor` and `b_floor`. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is computed as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. Otherwise, if `a_floor` is not greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is computed as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if else block.***
