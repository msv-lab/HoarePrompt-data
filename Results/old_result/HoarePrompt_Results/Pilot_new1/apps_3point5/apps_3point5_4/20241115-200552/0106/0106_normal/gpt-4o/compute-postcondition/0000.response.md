Example Answer:
The variable `block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The value of `block` is determined by dividing `apartment - 1` by `m * k` and adding 1 to the result. Since the initial state does not provide the value of `apartment`, the output state will be dependent on the value of `apartment` when the code is executed.
Output State: **Dependent on the value of `apartment`**
