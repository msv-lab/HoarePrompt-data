Example Answer:
`a` and `b` are assigned values by mapping integers obtained from splitting the input. The values of `a` and `b` depend on the input provided. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range, `a` and `b` are assigned values based on the input**
