Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list of length 2 filled with 0s. If both conditions ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) are met, then `count` is increased by 1. The postcondition covers the case where the conditions are met and `count` is incremented, ensuring that `prefix_balances` remains unchanged.***
