Output State: **T + 1 is a positive integer, n and x are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input string into integers, cnt0 is the count of '0' in the input string s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in the input string s, balance is the result of subtracting the count of '1's from the count of '0's in the input string s. Since the code prints -1 without affecting any variables, the output state remains the same.**
