Output State: After the execution of the if-else block, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 5` of the data list. The resulting `prefix_balances` list will have at least 3 elements. `n` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 3` of the data list. `x` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 4` of the data list. `index` is increased by 6. `n` is an integer value from the data list at the specified index. `x` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 1` of the data list. `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` of the data list. `balance` is calculated as the difference between the count of '0's and '1's in the string `s`.
