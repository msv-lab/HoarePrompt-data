According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the following states need to be adjusted:

State: **Output State: T is greater than 0, index is 4, results is an empty list, `n` is greater than 0, `x` contains the integer value at index 2 of `data`, `s` contains the value at index 3 of `data`, `balance` is the result of counting '0's minus counting '1's in string `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`**
