According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are:
State: **`T` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `n` is assigned the integer value at index 0 of the data and is greater than or equal to 1, `x` is assigned the integer value at index 1 of the data, `s` is assigned the string value at index 2 of the data, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in string `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of length n+1 filled with 0s**
