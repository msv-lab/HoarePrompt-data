Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It reads the number of test cases, the length of the string and the desired balance for each test case. It then calculates the balance of the given string and compares it with the desired balance. Based on this, it calculates and prints the number of prefixes of the infinite string with the desired balance or -1 if there are infinite such prefixes.

The annotations provide a clear explanation of the code logic and how it aligns with the problem description. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, and there are no edge cases identified where the code would not work correctly.
