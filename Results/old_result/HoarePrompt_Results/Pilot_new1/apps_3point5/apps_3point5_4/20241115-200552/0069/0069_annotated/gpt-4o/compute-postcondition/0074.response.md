Postcondition: ***After the execution of the loop, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances` that has not been iterated over yet. If `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`, then `count` is increased by 1. The postcondition covers all possible cases where the conditions are met, ensuring that `count` is correctly updated based on the given constraints.***
