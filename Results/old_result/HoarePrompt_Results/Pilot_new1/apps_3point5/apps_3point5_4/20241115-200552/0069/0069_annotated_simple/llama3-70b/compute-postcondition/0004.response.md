Example Answer:
The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0' and '1' in the string `s` respectively. The values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are calculated based on the previous value of `s`. 
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`**
