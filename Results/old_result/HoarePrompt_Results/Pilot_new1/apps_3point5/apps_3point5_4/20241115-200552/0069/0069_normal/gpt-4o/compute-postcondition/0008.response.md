Example Answer:
x is assigned the integer value at data[index + 1], which is an unknown value since the value of index is 1. s is assigned the value at data[index + 2]. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, index is 1, results is an empty list, n is an unknown value, x is an unknown value, s is an unknown value.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, index is 1, results is an empty list, n is an unknown value, x is an unknown value, s is an unknown value**
