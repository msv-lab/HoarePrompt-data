Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is an integer. The value of `index + 1` is used to access the next element in the list `data` and convert it to an integer. The previous value of `x` is unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[index + 1]`**
