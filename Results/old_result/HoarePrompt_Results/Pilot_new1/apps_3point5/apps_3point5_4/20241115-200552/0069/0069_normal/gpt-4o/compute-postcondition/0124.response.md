Since the state at the end of the previous iteration is unknown, we need to consider the general conditions for the loop to execute again. In this case, the loop will execute again as long as there are more elements in the `results` list. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must have at least one more element.
State: **`results` list has at least one more element**
