**Precondition**: 
- The input consists of T test cases, where T is an integer such that 1 <= T <= 100.
- For each test case:
  - n and x are integers such that 1 <= n <= 10^5 and -10^9 <= x <= 10^9.
  - The string s has a length of n and consists of only 0-s and 1-s.
- The total sum of n for all test cases does not exceed 10^5.
