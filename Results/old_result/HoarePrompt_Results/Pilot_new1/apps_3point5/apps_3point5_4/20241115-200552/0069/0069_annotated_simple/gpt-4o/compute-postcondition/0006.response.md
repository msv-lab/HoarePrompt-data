Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is 1. The value at index 1 of `data` is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`. The initial state mentions that `T` is greater than 0, so there are more elements in the `data` list. The `results` list is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: T is greater than 0, index is 1, results is an empty list, and `n` contains the integer value at index 1 of `data`.
Output State: **T is greater than 0, index is 1, results is an empty list, `n` contains the integer value at index 1 of `data`**
