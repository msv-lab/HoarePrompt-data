According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` is 3, `n` is at least 2. So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **s is assigned the value data[index + 2], prefix_balances is a list of integers with length n + 1, n is an integer value from data at index position, balance is recalculated based on the counts of '0's and '1's in s, results is updated, x is assigned the integer value from data at index + 1, index is increased by 3, prefix_balances is initialized as a list of zeros with length n + 1, n is at least 2, i is 4, prefix_balances[i] is updated based on the previous value of prefix_balances[i - 1] and the condition (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1), prefix_balances[i] is updated to the new value calculated. `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1`
