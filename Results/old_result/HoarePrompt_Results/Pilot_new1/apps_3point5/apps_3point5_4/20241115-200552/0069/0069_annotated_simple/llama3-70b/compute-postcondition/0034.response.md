Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is a string from user input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`, `n`, `x` are assigned values from user input after splitting, `cnt0` is assigned the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is assigned the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`. If `balance` is equal to `x`, then the program prints `n + 1`. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) is equal to 0, the program prints -1. Otherwise, the program prints the result of (x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the if else block based on the given conditions.***
