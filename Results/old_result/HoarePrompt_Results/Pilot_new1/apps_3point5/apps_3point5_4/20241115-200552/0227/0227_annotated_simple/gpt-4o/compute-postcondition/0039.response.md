Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean value. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True, `m` remains 1, `assigned` is unchanged, `x` is the next element in `assigned`, and the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. If `a[i] - x` is not in `assigned`, no changes occur in the variables `can_form`, `m`, `assigned`, and `x`.***
