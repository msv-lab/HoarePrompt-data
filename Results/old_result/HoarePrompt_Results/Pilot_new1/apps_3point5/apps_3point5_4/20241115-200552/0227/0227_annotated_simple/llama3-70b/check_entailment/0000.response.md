Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the input sequence `a`, then iterates through the elements of `a` to check if each element is double the value of the previous element. If an element does not meet this condition, the number of variables `m` is incremented. The final value of `m` is printed if it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise, -1 is printed. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
