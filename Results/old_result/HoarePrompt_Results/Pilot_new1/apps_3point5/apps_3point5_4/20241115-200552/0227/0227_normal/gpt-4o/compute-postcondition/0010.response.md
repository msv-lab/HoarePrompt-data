Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers in ascending order, `assigned` is a set containing the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the first element of list `a`. If the difference between the element at index `i` of list `a` and `x` is found in the set `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is broken. All edge cases including the initial conditions are covered in the postcondition.***
