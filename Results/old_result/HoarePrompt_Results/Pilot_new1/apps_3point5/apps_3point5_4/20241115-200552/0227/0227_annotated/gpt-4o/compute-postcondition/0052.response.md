Postcondition: ***`assigned` has at least 2 elements, `x` is not the last element in the `assigned` list, `a[i]` is different from `x`, `can_form` is True. If `a[i] - x` is in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains True and the loop continues.***
