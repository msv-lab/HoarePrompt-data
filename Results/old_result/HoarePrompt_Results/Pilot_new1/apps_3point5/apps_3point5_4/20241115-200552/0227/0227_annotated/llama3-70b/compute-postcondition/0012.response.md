Example Answer: 
The value of `m` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `m` is either 3 or 4. After execution, `m` will be either 4 or 5. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 23; a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order; m is either 4 or 5; i is 3.
Output State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 23; a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order; m is either 4 or 5; i is 3**
