Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `i` is 3, `m` may have been incremented by 1 based on the condition. If the value of the element in `a` at index 3 is not twice the value of the element at index 2, then `m` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no change occurs in the state of the variables.***
