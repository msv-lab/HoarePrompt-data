According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `assigned` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `can_form` is True, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, and `assigned` list has at least 1 element. To execute the loop one more time, the loop needs to iterate over the next element in the `assigned` list. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is 1, `i` is 2, `assigned` list has at least 1 element**
