Postcondition: ***n is a positive integer between 1 and 23; a is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order; m is either 3 or 4; i is 3. If a[i] is not equal to twice the value of a[i - 1], then m is increased by 1, resulting in m being either 4 or 5 after the execution of the if statement.***
