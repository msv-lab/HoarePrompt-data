According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the `assigned` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `can_form` is True, `m` is 1, `i` is 2, and `assigned` list has at least 1 element. Since there is no change in the values of `can_form`, `m`, `i`, and `assigned`, the loop will execute one more time with the same states.
State: **`can_form` is True, `m` is 1, `i` is 2, `assigned` list has at least 1 element**
