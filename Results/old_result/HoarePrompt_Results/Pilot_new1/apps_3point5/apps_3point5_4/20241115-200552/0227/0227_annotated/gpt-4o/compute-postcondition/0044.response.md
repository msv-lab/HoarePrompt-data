Postcondition: ***If `assigned` has at least 1 element and `x` is present in the `assigned` list, the loop will execute at least once. If `a[i] - x` is in the `assigned` list, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `x` is not in the `assigned` list, the loop will not execute. After the if statement, if `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1.***
