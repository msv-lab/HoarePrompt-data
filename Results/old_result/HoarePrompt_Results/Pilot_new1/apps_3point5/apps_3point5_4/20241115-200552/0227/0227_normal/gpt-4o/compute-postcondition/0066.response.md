Output State: **can_form is True if there exists a pair of elements x and a[i] in the assigned list such that their difference is also in the assigned list. m is increased by 1, i is incremented by 1, assigned list contains at least 3 elements, and a[i] has been added to the assigned list. If no such pair exists, can_form remains False. In the case where can_form is False, m is increased by 1, and all other conditions in the precondition are retained.**
