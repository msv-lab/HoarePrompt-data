According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are elements in the set `assigned`. Since `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers in ascending order, `assigned` will not be empty as long as `n` is greater than 1. 
For the loop to execute, the state needs to be adjusted to:
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers in ascending order, `assigned` is a set containing the first element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `can_form` is False, `x` is the first element of list `a`**
