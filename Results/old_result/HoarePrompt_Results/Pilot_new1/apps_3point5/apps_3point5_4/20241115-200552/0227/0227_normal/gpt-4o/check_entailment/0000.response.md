Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in two parameters, `n` and `a`, where `n` is the number of elements in the sequence and `a` is the list of distinct positive integers. 
- The function sorts the list `a` and initializes a set `assigned` to keep track of the values that have been assigned to the variables `b_i`.
- It then iterates through the elements of `a` and checks if there exists a pair of elements in `assigned` such that their difference is also in the set. If such a pair exists, it means that the sequence of operations can be performed with the current set of variables. If not, it increments the value of `m` which represents the minimum number of variables needed.
- Finally, the function returns the value of `m` after the loop has been executed.

The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement for all potential cases. It ensures that the variables `b_i` can be assigned values to perform the sequence of operations as required. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
