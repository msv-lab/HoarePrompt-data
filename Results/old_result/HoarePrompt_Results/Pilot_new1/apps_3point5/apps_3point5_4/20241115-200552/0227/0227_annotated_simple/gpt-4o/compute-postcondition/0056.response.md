Postcondition: ***If can_form is False, m is increased by 1, assigned is a list with at least 2 elements where a[i] is added, and x is the second element in assigned. If can_form is True, m remains 1, assigned is a list with at least 2 elements where a[i] is added, and x is the second element in assigned. If a[i] - x is in assigned, can_form is set to True and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
