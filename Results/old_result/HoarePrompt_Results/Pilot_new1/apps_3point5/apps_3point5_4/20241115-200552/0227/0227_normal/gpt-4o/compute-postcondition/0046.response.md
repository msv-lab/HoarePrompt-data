According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `can_form` is a boolean, `m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, `i` represents the index of the last element checked, `assigned` list contains at least 1 element, and `a[i]` has been added to the `assigned` list. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next index. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`can_form` is a boolean, `m` is increased by 1 if `can_form` is False, `i` is incremented by 1, `assigned` list contains at least 1 element, and `a[i]` has been added to the `assigned` list**
