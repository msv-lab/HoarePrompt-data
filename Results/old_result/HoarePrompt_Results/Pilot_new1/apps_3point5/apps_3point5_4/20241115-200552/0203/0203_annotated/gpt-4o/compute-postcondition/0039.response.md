According to the code, the loop can execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. At the end of the previous iteration, `d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`, and either `d_queue` or `r_queue` is updated based on the conditions provided. For the loop to execute one more time, both `d_queue` and `r_queue` need to remain non-empty. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **d_index is assigned the value popped from the front of d_queue. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue is updated by appending d_index + n. Otherwise, r_queue is updated by appending r_index + n. Both d_queue and r_queue are not empty.**
