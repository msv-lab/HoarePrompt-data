Output State: **`n` is at least 1, `fractions` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R' characters. If `fractions` contains only 'D's, then `depublicans` is equal to the number of 'D's and `remocrats` is 0. If `fractions` contains only 'R's, then `remocrats` is equal to the number of 'R's and `depublicans` is 0. If `fractions` contains a mix of 'D's and 'R's, then `depublicans` is the number of 'D's and `remocrats` is the number of 'R's. If `n` is 0, then `depublicans` and `remocrats` are both 0. Additionally, after entering the if condition `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`, `print('D')` is executed.**
