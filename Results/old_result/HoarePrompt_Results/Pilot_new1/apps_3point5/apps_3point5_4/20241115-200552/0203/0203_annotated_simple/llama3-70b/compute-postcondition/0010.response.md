According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `fractions` string. If there are more characters left in the `fractions` string, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R' characters with at least 1 character. If the first character in `fractions` is 'D', then `depublicans` is increased by 1 and `remocrats` remains 0. If the first character in `fractions` is not 'D', then `remocrats` is increased by 1 and `depublicans` remains 0. So, for the loop to execute one more time, the first character in `fractions` should be different from the character it was in the previous iteration.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `fractions` is a string of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R' characters with at least 1 character.**
