Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees. Both d_queue and r_queue are not empty. The loop will continue executing. d_index is updated with the value popped from the front of d_queue and r_index is updated with the value popped from the front of r_queue. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue will be appended with the value of d_index + n. If d_index is not less than r_index, r_queue will be appended with the value of r_index + n. This process will continue until either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty.**
