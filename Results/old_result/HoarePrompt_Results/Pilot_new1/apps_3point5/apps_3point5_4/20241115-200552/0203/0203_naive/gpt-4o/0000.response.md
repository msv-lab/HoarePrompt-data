Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly simulates the voting process as described in the problem statement. It maintains two queues, one for depublicans and one for remocrats, and keeps track of the indices of the employees in each queue. It then iterates through the queues, denying the right to vote for the employee with the lower index, and updating the queue accordingly. This process continues until only one faction remains, and the program correctly outputs the winning faction. The program handles all potential cases and follows the rules of the voting procedure accurately.
