Example Answer:
The value of `i` is incremented by 1, and then `i` is appended to the `r_queue`. The previous value of `i` is unknown, and `r_queue` now contains the updated `i` value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer representing the number of employees, `votes` is a string input with at least 1 character remaining, `r_queue` contains the updated `i` value, `i` is incremented by 1, `v` is the next character in the `votes` string.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of employees, `votes` is a string input with at least 1 character remaining, `r_queue` contains the updated `i` value, `i` is incremented by 1, `v` is the next character in the `votes` string**
