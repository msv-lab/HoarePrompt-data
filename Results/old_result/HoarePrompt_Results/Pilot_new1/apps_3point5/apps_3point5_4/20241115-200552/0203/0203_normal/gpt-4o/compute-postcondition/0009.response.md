Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, `d_queue` contains all 'D' characters from `votes` with their respective indices appended, `r_queue` contains all 'R' characters from `votes` with their respective indices appended. If the current character being processed is 'D', then the index `i` is appended to `d_queue`. If the current character being processed is not 'D', then the index `i` is appended to `r_queue`. All edge cases are handled, ensuring the correct processing of 'D' and 'R' characters in the input string.***
