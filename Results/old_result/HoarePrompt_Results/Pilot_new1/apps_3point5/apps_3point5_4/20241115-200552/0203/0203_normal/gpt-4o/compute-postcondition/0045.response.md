Postcondition: ***If d_queue is not empty, the loop continues to process the indices of 'D' characters. If d_queue becomes empty at any point, the loop terminates. After the loop, d_queue contains the updated indices of 'D' characters, and d_index is the last popped index from d_queue. If d_queue is empty, r_queue is not empty, and the loop has terminated. After the loop, r_queue contains the updated indices of 'R' characters, and r_index is the last popped index from r_queue. The program prints 'D' if d_queue is not empty, otherwise 'R' is printed.***
