The function `func` accepts an input for a positive integer `n` followed by a string `fractions` of length `n` containing only 'D' and 'R' characters. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' in the string and prints 'D' if the count of 'D's is greater than the count of 'R's, otherwise it prints 'R'. The function covers scenarios where `fractions` contains only 'D's, only 'R's, a mix of both, or when `n` is 0. The function does not have a specified return value.
