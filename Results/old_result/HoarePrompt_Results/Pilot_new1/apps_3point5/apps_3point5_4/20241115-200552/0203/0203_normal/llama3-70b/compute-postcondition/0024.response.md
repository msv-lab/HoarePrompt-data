Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer representing the number of employees, `depublicans` is the count of 'D' fractions, `remocrats` is the count of non-'D' fractions. If the number of 'D' fractions is greater than the number of non-'D' fractions, 'D' is printed. Otherwise, 'R' is printed. The final values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` depend on the number of 'D' and non-'D' fractions in the list respectively. If the fractions list is empty, both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain unchanged.***
