Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly simulates the voting process as described in the problem. It maintains two queues, one for depublicans and one for remocrats, and iterates through the votes according to the order provided. It correctly handles the scenario where an employee denies another employee the right to vote and skips their turn accordingly. The program continues this process until there is only one employee left in either queue, which determines the outcome of the vote. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description and covers all possible cases, making it correct.
