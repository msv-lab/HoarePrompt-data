Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n`, if the character processed is 'D', `i` is appended to `d_queue`. If the character processed is not 'D', `i` is appended to `r_queue`. The state of `d_queue` and `r_queue` is updated based on the characters processed in `votes`, ensuring all possible cases are covered.***
