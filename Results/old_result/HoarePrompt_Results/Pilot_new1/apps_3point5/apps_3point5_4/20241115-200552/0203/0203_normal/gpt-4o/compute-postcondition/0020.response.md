Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` remains a positive integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters. If the loop executes, `d_queue` contains the indices of 'D' characters in `votes` and `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters in `votes`. If the loop does not execute, `d_queue` and `r_queue` remain empty. The loop ensures that all 'D' and 'R' characters are appropriately processed and stored in their respective queues. Now, `d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`.**
