Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `c`, so the new value of `n` depends on the current value of `n` and `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string of digits, `t_set` contains the unique digits present in `t`, `n` is a string concatenated with `c`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string of digits, `t_set` contains the unique digits present in `t`, `n` is a string concatenated with `c`**
