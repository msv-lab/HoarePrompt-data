Example Answer:
The set `t_set` is assigned the set of unique elements in string `t`. As `t` is a string of digits, `t_set` will contain the unique digits present in `t`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: **s and t are strings of digits, t_set contains the unique digits present in string t**.
Output State: **s and t are strings of digits, t_set contains the unique digits present in string t**
