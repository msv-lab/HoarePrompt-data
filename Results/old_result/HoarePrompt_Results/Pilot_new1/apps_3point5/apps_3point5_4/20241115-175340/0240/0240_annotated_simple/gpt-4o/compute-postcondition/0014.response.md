Output State: **If chars is a non-empty string representing a number and sub is a substring of chars, the loop generates permutations of the characters in chars and joins them to form candidate. If candidate passes the validity check with respect to sub using the is_valid_number function, then candidate is yielded. If chars is an empty string or sub is not a substring of chars, the loop does not execute.**
