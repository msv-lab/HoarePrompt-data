Example Answer:
`candidate` is assigned the value of the joined `perm`, where `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`. The value of `perm` is not provided, but it is assumed that `perm` is a valid next permutation of `chars`. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of the string represented by `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of the string represented by `chars`**
