Example Answer:
`n` is assigned an empty string. The variables `s`, `t`, and `t_set` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` and `t` are strings of digits, `t_set` contains the unique digits present in string t, `n` is an empty string.
Output State: **`s` and `t` are strings of digits, `t_set` contains the unique digits present in string t, `n` is an empty string**
