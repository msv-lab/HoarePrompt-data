Postcondition: ***Next permutation of characters in `chars` is available, `candidate` is a string formed by joining the characters of the next permutation. If `candidate` passes the validity check with respect to `sub` using the function `is_valid_number`, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.***
