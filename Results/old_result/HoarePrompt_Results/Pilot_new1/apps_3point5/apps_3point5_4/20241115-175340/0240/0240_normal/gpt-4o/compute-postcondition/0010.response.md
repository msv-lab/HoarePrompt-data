Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`. The variable `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, so `candidate` will be a string representing the next permutation of `chars`. The other variables `chars`, `sub`, and `candidate` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty list with more permutations left, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of `chars`**
