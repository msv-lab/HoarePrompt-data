Functionality: **The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars` and `sub`, where `chars` is a string representing a number and `sub` is a substring of `chars`. The function iterates over all permutations of `chars`, constructs a candidate string from each permutation, and yields the candidate if it is a valid number with respect to the substring `sub`. If `chars` has less than 2 characters or `sub` is not a valid substring of `chars`, the loop does not execute. The function does not explicitly return a specific output.**
