According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `chars` and `perm`. If there are more permutations left in `chars`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty list with more permutations left, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of `chars`. For the loop to execute one more time, `chars` should still have more permutations left, and `perm` should be updated to the next permutation. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`chars` is a non-empty list with more permutations left, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of `chars`**
