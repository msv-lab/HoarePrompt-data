Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts two string parameters, s and t. It then iterates through each character in s, and if the character is present in the set t, it appends that character to the string n. After the loop, it concatenates string t to n and returns the integer value of the resulting string n. If s is empty or no characters in s are in t, n will be an empty string. The function does not handle cases where the input strings contain non-numeric characters or special characters.**
