According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the string `s`. The loop will iterate over each character in `s`. Before the loop starts, the string `s` should not be empty. Additionally, since `t_set` contains unique elements from string `t`, it might be used inside the loop. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `s` is not empty, `t_set` contains unique elements from string `t`, and `n` remains an empty string.
State: **`s` is not empty, `t_set` contains unique elements from string `t`, `n` is an empty string**
