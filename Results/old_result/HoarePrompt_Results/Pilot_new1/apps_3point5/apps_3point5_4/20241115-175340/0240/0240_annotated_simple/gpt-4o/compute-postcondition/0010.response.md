Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together as a string. The value of `perm` is not given, but it is mentioned that the next permutation of characters in `chars` is available. Therefore, the output state is: Next permutation of characters in `chars` is available, `candidate` is a string formed by joining the characters of the next permutation.
Output State: **Next permutation of characters in `chars` is available, `candidate` is a string formed by joining the characters of the next permutation**
