According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `chars` and `sub`. If `chars` has at least 2 characters and `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `chars` being a string representing a number does not ensure that the loop will execute. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, `chars` must have at least 2 characters, `sub` must be a valid substring of `chars`, and `perm` should be the first permutation of `chars`.
State: **`chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`**
