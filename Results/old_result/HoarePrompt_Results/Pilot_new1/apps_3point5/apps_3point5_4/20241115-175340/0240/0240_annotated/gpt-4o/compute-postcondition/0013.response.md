According to the code, the loop will execute again as long as there are more permutations of `chars` to go through. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of the string represented by `chars`. To execute the loop one more time, the next permutation of `chars` needs to be generated. 
State: **`chars` is a string representing a number with at least 2 characters, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and `candidate` is the next permutation of the string represented by `chars`.**
