The function func_1 accepts two string parameters `s` and `sub`. It then updates a counter for each character in `s` by subtracting the count of that character in `sub`. After that, it generates a list of possible numbers based on the remaining characters in `s` and `sub`, finds the smallest number from that list, and returns it.
