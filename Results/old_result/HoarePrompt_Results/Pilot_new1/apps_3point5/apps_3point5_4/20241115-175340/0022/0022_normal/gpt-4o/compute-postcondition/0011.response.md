According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2 characters. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the program returns False. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n // 2 + 1` to ensure the loop runs for one more iteration.
State: **s is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2 characters, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1`**
