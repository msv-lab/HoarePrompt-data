Output State: **If the string `s` is a palindrome, `is_spalindrome` remains True after the loop executes. If the string `s` is not a palindrome, `is_spalindrome` is set to False when the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` do not match. The loop will not execute if the length of the string `s` is less than 2.**
