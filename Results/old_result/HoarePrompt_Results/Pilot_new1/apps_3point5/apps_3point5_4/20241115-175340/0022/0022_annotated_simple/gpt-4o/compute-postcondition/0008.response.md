According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s` which is at least 2, and `i` is less than `n // 2`. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, then the function returns False. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration. Since `i` is incremented by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1`.
State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s` which is at least 2, `i` is equal to the previous value of `i` + 1**
