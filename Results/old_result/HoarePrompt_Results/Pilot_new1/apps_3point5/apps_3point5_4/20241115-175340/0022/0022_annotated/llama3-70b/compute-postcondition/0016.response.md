According to the code, the loop will execute one more time if the condition `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - i - 1]` at the end of the previous iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is equal to (n // 2) + 1. If the condition `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the states that need to be adjusted are `s[i]` and `s[n - i - 1` must be equal.
State: **`s` is a string of length at least 2, containing only English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is equal to (n // 2) + 1, and `s[i]` is equal to `s[n - i - 1]`.**
