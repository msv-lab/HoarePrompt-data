According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2 characters, and `n` is the length of string `s` with `n` greater than or equal to 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n // 2 + 1`.
State: **s is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2 characters, n is the length of string s and n is greater than or equal to 2, i is less than n // 2 + 1**
