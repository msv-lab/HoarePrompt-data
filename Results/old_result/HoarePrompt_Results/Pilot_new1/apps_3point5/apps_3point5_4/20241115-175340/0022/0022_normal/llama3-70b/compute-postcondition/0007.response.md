Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, consisting of only English letters; `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is between 0 and n // 2 - 1. If the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` in `s` are not equal, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. All other variables retain their initial values and constraints.***
