Output State: **s is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, n is an integer between 2 and 1000, i is a non-negative integer less than n/2. If the character at index i in string s is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - i, the function returns False. This covers all cases where the characters at the specified indices do not match. If n is less than 2, the loop won't execute.**
