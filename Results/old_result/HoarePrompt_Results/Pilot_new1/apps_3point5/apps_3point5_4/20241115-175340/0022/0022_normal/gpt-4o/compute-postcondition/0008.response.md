According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2 characters. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be less than `n // 2 + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **s is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2 characters**.
