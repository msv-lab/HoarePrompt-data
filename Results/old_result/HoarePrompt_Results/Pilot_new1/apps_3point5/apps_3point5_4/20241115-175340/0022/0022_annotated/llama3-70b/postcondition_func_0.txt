The function `func` reads an input string `s`, checks if `s` is a palindrome (a word that reads the same backward as forward), and prints 'TAK' if it is a palindrome, or 'NIE' if it is not. The function does not accept any parameters and operates on strings of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only English letters. The function correctly identifies palindromes and non-palindromes, but it does not return any value.
