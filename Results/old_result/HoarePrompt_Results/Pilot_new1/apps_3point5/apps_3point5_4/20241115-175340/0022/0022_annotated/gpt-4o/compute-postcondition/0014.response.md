The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. The function also accepts two additional parameters, `n` and `i`, where `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, and `i` is a non-negative integer less than `n/2`. 

In Case 1, if the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. This condition covers all cases where the characters at the specified indices do not match. If `n` is less than 2, the loop won't execute.

In Case 2, the program returns True. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s`, an integer `n`, and a non-negative integer `i`, and based on the conditions described above, return True or False.
