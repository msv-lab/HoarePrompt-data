Output State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, containing only English letters; `n` is greater than or equal to 2. The loop checks if the characters at the start and end of the string are the same, iterating through the first half of the string. If any pair of characters is not equal, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop breaks. If `s` is an empty string or has only one character, the loop does not execute and `is_spalindrome` remains True.**
