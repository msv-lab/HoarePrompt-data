According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `is_spalindrome` is True, and `i` is between 0 and n // 2 - 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value greater than the current `i`. Since the loop iterates over `n // 2`, the next value for `i` would be `i + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, consisting of only English letters; `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000; `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is between 0 and n // 2**
