Example Answer:
`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers. The input is split and mapped to `x`, `y`, and `z`. Since the values are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the output state will be the same as the input state with the updated values of `x`, `y`, and `z`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
