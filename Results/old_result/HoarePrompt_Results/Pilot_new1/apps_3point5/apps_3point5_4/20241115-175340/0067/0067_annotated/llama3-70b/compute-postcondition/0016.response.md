Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The condition x > y + z is false. If x < y, the program prints '-'. If x equals y and z is 0, the program prints '0'. If x equals y and z is not 0, the program prints '?'. If x is not less than y, the program prints '?'.***
