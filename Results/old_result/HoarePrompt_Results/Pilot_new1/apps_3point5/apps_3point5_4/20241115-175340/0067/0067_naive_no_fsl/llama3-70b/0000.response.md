Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if there are more upvotes than downvotes, in which case it prints "+", if there are more downvotes than upvotes, it prints "-", if they are equal and there are no unknown votes, it prints "0", and if there are unknown votes, it prints "?". The logic covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
