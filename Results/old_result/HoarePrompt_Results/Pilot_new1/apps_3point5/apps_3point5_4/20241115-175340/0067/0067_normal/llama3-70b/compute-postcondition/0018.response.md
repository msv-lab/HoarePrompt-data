The function `func` does not accept any parameters. It operates based on the predefined constraints for non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The function does not have any explicit return value, as the output or side effects are determined by the internal operations of the function. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to perform operations based on the constraints of non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` within the range of 0 to 100.
