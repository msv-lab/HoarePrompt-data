Example Answer: 
`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, which was obtained by splitting the input string and converting it to an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_upvotes` is the value obtained from the input string after conversion to an integer, `y` and `z` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`min_upvotes` is the value obtained from the input string after conversion to an integer, `y` and `z` remain unchanged**
