Example Answer:
`max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, but the initial value of `x` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `min_upvotes` is the value obtained from the input string after conversion to an integer, `y` and `z` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`min_upvotes` is the value obtained from the input string after conversion to an integer, `y` and `z` remain unchanged**
