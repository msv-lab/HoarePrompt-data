Example Answer:
`remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo 10. The modulo operator (%) returns the remainder of the division of `n` by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer, the possible values of `remainder` can be from 0 to 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is a digit from 0 to 9.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `remainder` is a digit from 0 to 9**
