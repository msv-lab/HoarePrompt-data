Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It checks if the input number `n` is divisible by 10, and if so, it prints `n` as it is already rounded. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it adjusts `n` to the nearest multiple of 10 based on the remainder of `n` divided by 10. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it prints `n` minus the remainder; otherwise, it prints `n` plus the difference between 10 and the remainder. The code annotations also accurately describe the logic implemented in the code. Since all potential cases are covered and the code aligns with the problem description, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
