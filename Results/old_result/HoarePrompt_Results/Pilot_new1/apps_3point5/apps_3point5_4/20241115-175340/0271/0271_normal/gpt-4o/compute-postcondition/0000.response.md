Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value of `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the initial state mentions that `n` is a non-negative integer, we can assume that the input will be a non-negative integer. Therefore, after execution, `n` will hold a non-negative integer value.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer**
