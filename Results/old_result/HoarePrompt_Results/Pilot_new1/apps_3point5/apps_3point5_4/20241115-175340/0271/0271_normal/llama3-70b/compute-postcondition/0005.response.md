Example Answer: 
The code snippet prints the result of `n - n % 10`, which essentially removes the last digit of `n` by subtracting `n % 10` from `n`. Since the last digit of `n` is less than or equal to 5, the subtraction will always remove the last digit. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10, and the last digit of n is less than or equal to 5.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10, and the last digit of n is less than or equal to 5**
