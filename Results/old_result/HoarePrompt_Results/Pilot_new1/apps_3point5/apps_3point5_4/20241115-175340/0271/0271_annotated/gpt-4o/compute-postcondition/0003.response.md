Example Answer:
The variable `result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`. Given that `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, and `remainder` is between 0 and 9, with the condition that `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, the result will be a non-negative integer as well. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is between 0 and 9 (remainder ≤ 5), and `result` is a non-negative integer**
