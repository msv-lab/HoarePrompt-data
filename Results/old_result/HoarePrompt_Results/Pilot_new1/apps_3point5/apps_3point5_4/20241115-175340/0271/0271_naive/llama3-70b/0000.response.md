Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly implements the logic to round the given number to the nearest integer that ends with zero. It checks if the number already ends with zero, in which case it prints the number as it is. If the last digit of the number is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down by subtracting the last digit. If the last digit is greater than 5, it rounds up by adding the difference between 10 and the last digit. This logic covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement. Therefore, the program is correct.
