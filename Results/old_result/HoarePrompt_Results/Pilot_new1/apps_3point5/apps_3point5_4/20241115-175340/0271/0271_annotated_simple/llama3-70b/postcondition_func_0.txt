The function reads a non-negative integer `n` from the user input. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it adjusts `n` to the nearest multiple of 10 by either subtracting or adding the remainder of `n` divided by 10 to `n` to ensure the final output is a multiple of 10 that is greater than or equal to `n`.
