Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer input `n` from the user, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, adjusts `n` to the nearest multiple of 10. The final result is then printed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
