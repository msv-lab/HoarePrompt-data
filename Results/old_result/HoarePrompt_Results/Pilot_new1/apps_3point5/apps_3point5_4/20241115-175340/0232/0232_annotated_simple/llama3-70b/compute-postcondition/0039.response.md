Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, the program state is such that `found` remains True, `i` is still 0, `n` is still greater than or equal to 1, `window_counts` dictionary maintains the updated `color: 1` mapping, `j` remains 1, `color` retains the value of `colors[0]`, `color` is still not present in `window_counts`, and all the values in the `window_counts` dictionary are equal to the corresponding values in the `counts` list after sorting. This postcondition covers all possible edge cases and ensures the consistency of the program state.***
