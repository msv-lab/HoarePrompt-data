According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n`. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If color is not in window_counts, window_counts[color] is assigned the value 1. In all other cases, window_counts remains unchanged. `found` is True and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. `j` is less than `n`**
