Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer between 1 and 100, `m` is an integer between 1 and `n`, `colors` is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 1 color, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from splitting the input string, `color_counts` is a dictionary with the key `color` and value 0 if `color` was not already present in `color_counts`. The program state remains unchanged for all other variables and lists.***
