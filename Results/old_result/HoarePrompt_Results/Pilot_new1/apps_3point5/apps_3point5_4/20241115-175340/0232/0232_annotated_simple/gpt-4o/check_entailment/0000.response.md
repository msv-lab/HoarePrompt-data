Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It iterates through the list of colors, updating the current counts of each color and checking if the desired counts have been reached for each color. If all desired counts have been met, it returns 'YES'. Otherwise, it continues iterating until the end of the list and then returns 'NO'. The program handles all potential cases and correctly determines whether an interval with the prescribed color counts exists.
