Postcondition: ***colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 1 integer. color is the color at index j in the list, color_counts and window_counts are updated accordingly, j is equal to i, n is greater than or equal to i. If color is not in window_counts, then window_counts[color] is initialized to 0. In all other cases, window_counts[color] is incremented by 1. If all counts in sorted window_counts values are equal to their respective targets in counts, found is set to True and the loop breaks.***
