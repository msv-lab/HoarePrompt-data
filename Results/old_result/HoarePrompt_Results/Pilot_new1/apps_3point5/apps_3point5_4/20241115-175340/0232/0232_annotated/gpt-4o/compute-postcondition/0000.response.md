Example Answer:
The `desired_counts` dictionary is created by zipping the range from 1 to `m` with the list `k`. Since `m` is a positive integer in the range [1, n] and `k` is a list of m integers, the `desired_counts` dictionary will have keys from 1 to `m` and corresponding values from the list `k`. 
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to their respective values in list k**
