Output State: **colors list is not empty, found is either True or False, color_counts contains the count of each color in the colors list, window_counts is a dictionary with the count of color occurrences where the count of color assigned to color is incremented by 1, i is less than n+1, color is assigned the value at index j in the colors list. If color is not in window_counts, then window_counts[color] is set to 0. All values in window_counts after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in counts. If all values in window_counts after sorting are equal to the corresponding values in counts, found is set to True and the loop breaks, j is less than n+1**
