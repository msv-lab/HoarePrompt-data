Example Answer:
The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. The variable `window_counts` is not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: If color is not in window_counts, window_counts[color] is assigned the value 1. In all other cases, window_counts remains unchanged, `found` is True.
Output State: **If color is not in window_counts, window_counts[color] is assigned the value 1. In all other cases, window_counts remains unchanged, `found` is True**
