Output State: **If there is any color in `current_counts` where the count is less than the corresponding value in `desired_counts`, the loop will not terminate. The loop continues until all colors in `current_counts` have counts greater than or equal to the corresponding values in `desired_counts`. If this condition is met, the function returns 'YES'. The values of `desired_counts`, `current_counts`, `left`, `right`, and `n` remain unchanged after each iteration of the loop.**
