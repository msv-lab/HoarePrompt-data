According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `right` and `n`. If `right` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the value in `current_counts` for the color at index `right` is incremented by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `right` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n` by incrementing it by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **The value in `current_counts` for the color at index `right+1` is incremented by 1**
