Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values and stores them in appropriate data structures. It then iterates through all possible contiguous intervals of Jedi Knights and checks if the counts of lightsabers of each color in that interval match the desired counts. If a matching interval is found, it sets the `found` flag to True and breaks out of the loop. The program then prints 'YES' if a matching interval was found, and 'NO' otherwise.

The program logic aligns with the problem description and correctly determines if there exists an interval with the prescribed color counts. The implementation covers all potential cases and edge cases, making it a correct solution.
