According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more colors left in the list `colors`. At the end of the last iteration, colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 3 integers. To execute the loop one more time, there must be at least 4 integers in the list. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} with at least 4 integers, color_counts remains unchanged**
