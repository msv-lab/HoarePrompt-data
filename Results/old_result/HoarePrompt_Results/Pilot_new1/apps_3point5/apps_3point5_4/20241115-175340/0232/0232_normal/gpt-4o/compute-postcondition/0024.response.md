Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. 
- `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n. 
- `colors` is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. 
- `k` is a list of m integers such that 1 <= sum(k) <= n.

The function iterates through the `colors` list, incrementing the counts of colors in `current_counts` until they match the desired counts in `desired_counts` for all colors. If the counts match, it returns 'YES'. If the loop ends due to `left` exceeding the limit, it returns 'NO'. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and 'NO' is returned.**
