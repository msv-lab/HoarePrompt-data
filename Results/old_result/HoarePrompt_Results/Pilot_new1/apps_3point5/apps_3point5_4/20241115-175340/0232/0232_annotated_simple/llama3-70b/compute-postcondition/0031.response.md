Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable that is True after the execution of the if statement. `i` remains 0, `n` is still greater than or equal to 1, `window_counts` is a dictionary with updated `color: 1`, `j` remains 0, `color` retains the value of `colors[0] and `color` is still not in `window_counts`. Additionally, all the values in the `window_counts` dictionary are equal to the corresponding values in the `counts` list after sorting.***
