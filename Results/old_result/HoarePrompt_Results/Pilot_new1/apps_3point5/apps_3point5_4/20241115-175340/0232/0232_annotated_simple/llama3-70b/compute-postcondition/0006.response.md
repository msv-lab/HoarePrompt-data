Example Answer: 
A new key-value pair is added to the `color_counts` dictionary where the key is the color from the `colors` list, and the value is 0. The color is not present in `color_counts` before, so the color is added with a count of 0.
Output State: **`colors` list has at least 1 color and the color is not present in `color_counts`, `color_counts` contains the new key-value pair with color: 0**
