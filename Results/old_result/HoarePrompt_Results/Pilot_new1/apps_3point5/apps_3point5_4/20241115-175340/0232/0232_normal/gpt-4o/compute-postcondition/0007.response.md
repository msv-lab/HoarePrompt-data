Postcondition: ***`current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values where the count of `colors[right]` is increased by 1, `left` is 0, `right` is 1, and `n` is greater than 0. If all the counts in `current_counts` match the desired counts specified in `desired_counts` for each color, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there are no changes to the state of the variables.***
