Output State: **`found` is True, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `window_counts` contains relevant entries for the loop, `j` is incremented by 1, `color` is updated to `colors[j+1]`, `color` is present in `window_counts` if it satisfies the condition, all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding targets in `counts` after sorting, `j` is less than `n`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and if `color` is not in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is set to 1.**
