Postcondition: ***`found` is false, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` as a key and its value set to 1 (incremented by 1), `j` is equal to `i`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[i]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. The values in `window_counts` dictionary are sorted and compared to the `counts` list. If all the values in `window_counts` match the corresponding values in `counts`, the condition is true.***
