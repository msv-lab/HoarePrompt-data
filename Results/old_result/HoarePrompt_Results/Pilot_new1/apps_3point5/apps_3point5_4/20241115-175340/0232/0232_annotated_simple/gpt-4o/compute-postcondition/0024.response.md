Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts four parameters: `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. It iterates through the colors list, updating the counts of each color in `current_counts`. The function continues this process until all colors in `current_counts` have counts greater than or equal to the corresponding values in `desired_counts`. If this condition is met, the function returns 'YES'. If the condition is not met after iterating through all colors, the function returns 'NO'. The function handles cases where the loop terminates early due to color counts not meeting desired counts.**
