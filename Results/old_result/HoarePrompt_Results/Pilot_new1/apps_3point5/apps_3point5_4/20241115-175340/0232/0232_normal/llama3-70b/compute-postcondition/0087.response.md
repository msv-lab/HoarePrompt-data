Example Answer:
The dictionary `window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. The variables `found` remains false, `i` is still incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is false, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`found` is false, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary**
