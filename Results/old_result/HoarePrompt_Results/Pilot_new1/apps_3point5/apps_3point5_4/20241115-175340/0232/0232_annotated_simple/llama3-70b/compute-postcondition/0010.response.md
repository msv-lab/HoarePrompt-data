Example Answer: 
The `color_counts` dictionary is updated with the key `color` and value `0`. The previous values of `color_counts` are unknown, but after this operation, the count of `color` is set to 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` list has at least 2 colors, `color_counts` dictionary is updated with the count of a specific color set to 0.
Output State: **`colors` list has at least 2 colors, `color_counts` dictionary is updated with the count of a specific color set to 0**
