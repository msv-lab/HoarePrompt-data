The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns the result of the mathematical operation 2^k + n, where n is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 10^9 and k is a non-negative integer ranging from 0 to 8. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the result of 2^k + n based on the given constraints. 
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the result of 2^k + n, where n is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9, and k is a non-negative integer between 0 and 8.**
