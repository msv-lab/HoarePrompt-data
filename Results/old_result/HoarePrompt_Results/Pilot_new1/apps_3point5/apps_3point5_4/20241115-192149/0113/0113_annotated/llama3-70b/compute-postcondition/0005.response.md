According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `n % x != 0`. For the loop to execute one more time, the value of `n` needs to be such that the condition `n % x != 0` is still satisfied. Since `n` is increased by 1 at the end of the previous iteration, to ensure the loop can execute again, `n` needs to be increased by 1 more and `x` needs to remain the same. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is increased by 2, x is 10^(k+1)**
