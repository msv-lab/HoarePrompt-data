Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the k-rounding of n as described in the problem. The function `func_1` accepts two positive integer parameters `n` and `k` and calculates the value of 'x' using the formula `n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`, where `multiplier = 10 ** k`. This formula ensures that the output value x ends with k or more zeros and is divisible by n. The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the provided examples. Therefore, the code is correct.
