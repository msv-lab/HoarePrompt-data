The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, where `n` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. It calculates the value of 'x' by multiplying `n` with a modified multiplier based on the greatest common divisor of `n` and the multiplier. The function then returns the calculated value of 'x'.
