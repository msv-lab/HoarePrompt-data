Example Answer:
The variable `multiplier` is assigned the value `10 ** k`, where `k` is guaranteed to be between 0 and 8. Since `k` is between 0 and 8, `10 ** k` will be a power of 10 between 1 and 100,000,000. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `multiplier` is a positive integer that is a power of 10 between 1 and 100,000,000.
