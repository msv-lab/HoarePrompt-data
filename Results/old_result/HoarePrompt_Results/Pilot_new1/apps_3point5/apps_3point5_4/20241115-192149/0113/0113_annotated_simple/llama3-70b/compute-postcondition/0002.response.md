Example Answer:
`n` is incremented by 1. Since `n` is a positive integer, the new value of `n` will be the previous value of `n` plus 1. The other variables `k` and `x` remain unaffected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100000000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100000000**
