Example Answer:
The value of `n` is incremented by 1, and since it was initially a positive integer incremented by 6, the new value of `n` will be a positive integer incremented by 7. The values of `k` and `x` remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 7, `k` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100000000**
