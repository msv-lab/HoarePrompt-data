According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n` and `x`. If `n % x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer incremented by 7, and `x` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100000000. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer incremented by 7, and `x` needs to be adjusted to `x` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100000001. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 7, `k` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100000001**
