According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the condition `n % x != 0`. This means the loop will execute again if `n` is not divisible by `x`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is increased by 1 and `x` is 10^(k) where k is the same as before.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that the new value of `n` is not divisible by the new value of `x`. Therefore, the new value of `n` should be one more than the previous value, and the new value of `x` should be 10^(k+1).

State: **n is increased by 1, x is 10^(k+1), where k is the same as before**
