The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. The function calculates the value of variable `x` by multiplying `n` with a modified multiplier based on `k` and returns this value. The function uses the math module to calculate the greatest common divisor.
