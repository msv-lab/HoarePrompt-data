Output State: **If n is not divisible by x, the loop will execute at least once and n will be a positive integer incremented by the smallest value greater than 0 that makes n divisible by x. k is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, x is a positive integer ranging from 1 to 100000000. If n is already divisible by x, the loop won't execute and the values of n, k, and x will remain the same.**
