Example Answer: 
`ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`, so after execution, `ans` is incremented by 1. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_time` is the result of the calculation of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is an integer representing the index of the bus with the minimum time incremented by 1, `buses` is a list of buses with at least 2 elements, `i` is an integer, `s` and `d` are the values of the second tuple in the list, `time` is the result of the calculation of `(t - s) % d`.
Output State: **`min_time` is the result of the calculation of `(t - s) % d`, `ans` is an integer representing the index of the bus with the minimum time incremented by 1, `buses` is a list of buses with at least 2 elements, `i` is an integer, `s` and `d` are the values of the second tuple in the list, `time` is the result of the calculation of `(t - s) % d**
