Functionality: **The function reads input for the number of buses and the target time, then iterates through each bus's start and duration times to calculate the minimum time required to reach the destination considering multiple bus routes. It then prints the index of the bus with the minimum time. If there are no buses, the function will not execute the loop and will not print anything.**
