Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` is the updated source of bus route 1, `d_i` is the updated destination of bus route 1. After the execution of the if-else block, `wait_time` is determined as follows: if `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If the condition `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0` holds true, then `wait_time` is set to 0. In all other cases, `wait_time` is computed as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` based on the updated values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment.***
