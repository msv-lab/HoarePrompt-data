Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time`, and `chosen_route` is set to 2. The values of `i`, `n`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. The calculation of `wait_time` is based on the updated values of `s_i`, `d_i`, and `t`. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, `wait_time` is `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is 0. In all other cases, `wait_time` is computed as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment.***
