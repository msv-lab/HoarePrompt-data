Postcondition: ***`min_time` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum time. `ans` is an integer representing the index of the bus with the minimum time. `buses` is a list of buses with at least 3 elements. `i` is the index of the next bus. `s` and `d` are the values of the third tuple in the list. `time` is the result of the calculation of `(t - s) % d`. If the calculated `time` is less than `min_time`, `min_time` is updated to the value of `time`, and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. The other variables remain unchanged.***
