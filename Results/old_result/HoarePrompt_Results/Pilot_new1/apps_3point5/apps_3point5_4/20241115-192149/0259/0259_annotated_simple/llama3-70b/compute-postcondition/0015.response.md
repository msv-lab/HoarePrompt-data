According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the buses list. If the list has at least 1 tuple, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, n will be a positive integer between 1 and 100, and t will be a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5. So for the loop to execute, the buses list must have at least 1 tuple, and i is 0, s and d are integers obtained from splitting the input by space.
State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5, buses contains at least 1 tuple (s, d) where s and d are integers obtained from splitting the input by space, min_time is initialized to positive infinity, ans is assigned -1, i is 0, s and d are integers obtained from splitting the input by space**
