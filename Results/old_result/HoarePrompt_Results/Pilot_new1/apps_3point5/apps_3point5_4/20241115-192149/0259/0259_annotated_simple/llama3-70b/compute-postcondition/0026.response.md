According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `buses`. If `buses` contains at least 3 tuples, the loop will execute one more time. 

At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains at least 2 tuples (s, d), `min_time` has been updated with the calculated time, `ans` is updated to i + 1 if the calculated time is less than the previous min_time, otherwise `min_time` and `ans` remain unchanged, `i` is 1, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from splitting the input by space, time is calculated as (t - s) % d, and `ans` is 2. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, `buses` must contain at least 3 tuples. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5, buses contains at least 3 tuples (s, d), min_time has been updated with the calculated time, ans is updated to i + 1 if the calculated time is less than the previous min_time, otherwise min_time and ans remain unchanged, i is 1, s and d are integers obtained from splitting the input by space, time is calculated as (t - s) % d, and ans is 2**
