Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned values using `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` splits the input values separated by spaces, and `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers. The values of `n` and `t` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `t` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^5.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 100 and 1 <= t <= 10^5**
