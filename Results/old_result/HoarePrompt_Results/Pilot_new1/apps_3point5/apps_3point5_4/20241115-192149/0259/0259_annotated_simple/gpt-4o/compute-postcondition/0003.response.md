Example Answer: 
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the tuple `bus_routes[i]` where `i` is 0. Since `bus_routes` is not given in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `s_i` and `d_i`. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
