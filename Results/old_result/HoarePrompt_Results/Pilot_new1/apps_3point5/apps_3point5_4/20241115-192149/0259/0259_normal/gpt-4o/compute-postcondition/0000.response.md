Example Answer:
The variable `min_wait_time` is assigned the value `float('inf')`, which represents positive infinity. The other variables `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, and `min_wait_time` is positive infinity.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity**
