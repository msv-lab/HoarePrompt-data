Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer updated based on the conditions provided; `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1` where `i` is 1; `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of `bus_routes[i]`, and `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of `bus_routes[i]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.*** This postcondition covers all scenarios where the wait time is either 0 or calculated based on the given formula, ensuring the proper initialization and updating of variables in the program fragment.
