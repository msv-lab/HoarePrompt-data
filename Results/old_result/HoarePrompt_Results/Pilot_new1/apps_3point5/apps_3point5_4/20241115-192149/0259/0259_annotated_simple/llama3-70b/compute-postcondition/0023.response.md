Example Answer:
The value of `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`, where `time` is calculated as (t - s) % d. The previous values of the affected variables are n, t, buses, ans, i, s, and d. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer between 1 and 100, t is a positive integer satisfying 1 <= t <= 10^5, buses contains at least 2 tuples (s, d), min_time has been updated with the calculated time, i is 1, s and d are integers obtained from splitting the input by space, and time is calculated as (t - s) % d.
