Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the number 1 in the list `a` and assigns it to `min_pos`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the index of 1 in the list will be 0. Therefore, `min_pos` is assigned the value 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0**
