Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by performing exactly one swap. It first finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array. Then it calculates the maximum distance by considering the distance between the two elements and the remaining elements in the array. The logic seems to cover all potential cases and the examples provided work correctly as well.
