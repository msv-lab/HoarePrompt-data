Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is `n-1`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and `n-1`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n-1` and `n-1`, `dist3` is 0, `dist4` is the absolute difference between `n-1` and `min_pos`, `max_distance` is the maximum value among `dist1`, `dist2`, `dist3`, and `dist4`, and the program prints the value of `max_distance`**
