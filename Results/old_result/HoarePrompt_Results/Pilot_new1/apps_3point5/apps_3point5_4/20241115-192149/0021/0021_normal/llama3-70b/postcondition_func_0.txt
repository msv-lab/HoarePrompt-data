The function reads an integer `n` from input, then reads a list of integers `a`. It finds the positions of the first occurrence of 1 and `n` in the list `a`. It calculates the maximum and minimum distances between these positions and either end of the list. The function then prints the maximum of these distances or `n - 1 - min_dist`. The code does not handle any exceptions or edge cases related to input validation or erroneous inputs.
