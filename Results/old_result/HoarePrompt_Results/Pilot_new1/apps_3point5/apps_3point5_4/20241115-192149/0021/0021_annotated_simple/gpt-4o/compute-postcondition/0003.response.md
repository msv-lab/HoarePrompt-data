Example Answer:
`max_pos` is assigned the index of the value `n` in list `a`. Since `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to n, and `n` is an input integer, the index of `n` in list `a` will be the maximum possible value. Therefore, `max_pos` will be the maximum index in list `a`, which is `n - 1`. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n - 1**
