Example Answer:
The index of the integer `n` in the list `a` is assigned to `posn`. The list `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, so the index of `n` in the list `a` will be `n-1`. Therefore, `posn` is assigned the value `n-1`. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **n is an input integer, a is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, pos1 is 0, posn is n-1**
