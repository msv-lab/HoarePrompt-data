Example Answer:
`max_pos` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a`. The value of `n` is an input integer, and `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. Since `n` is the maximum value in list `a`, `max_pos` will be the index of `n` in list `a`. The index of `n` in list `a` will be `n-1` since the list is zero-indexed. Therefore, `max_pos` is `n-1`. The state of other variables remains the same. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is `n-1`**
