Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user, followed by a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of 0 and `n-1` in the list `a`, and prints this maximum distance. The function does not have any return value specified.**
