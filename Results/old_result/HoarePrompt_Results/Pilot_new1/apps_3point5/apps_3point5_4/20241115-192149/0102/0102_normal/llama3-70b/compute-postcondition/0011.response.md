Postcondition: ***s is an input integer such that 10 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones is a list containing words for numbers from zero to nine; teens is a list containing words for numbers from ten to nineteen; tens is a list containing words for tens from twenty to ninety. If s < 20, the function prints the word representation from the teens list corresponding to the input value s. If 20 ≤ s ≤ 99, the function prints the word representation of the number s using the ones, tens, and teens lists. The postcondition covers all possible cases for the input integer s and the resulting word representation being printed.***
