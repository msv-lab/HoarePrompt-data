The function func_1 accepts an integer n between 0 and 99 and returns the corresponding string representation based on specific conditions met within the given ranges of n. If n is in the range of 0 to 9, the function returns the corresponding string from ones. If n is in the range of 11 to 19, the function returns the corresponding string from teens. If n is a multiple of 10, the function returns the string representing the tens place of n. For any other two-digit number, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of n with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place of n. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios for the given ranges of n, ensuring that the appropriate representations are returned based on the conditions met.
