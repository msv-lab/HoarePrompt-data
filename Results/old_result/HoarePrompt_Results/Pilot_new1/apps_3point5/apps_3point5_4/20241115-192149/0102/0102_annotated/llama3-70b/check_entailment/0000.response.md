Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program accurately converts an integer score into its word representation as required by the problem description. The code covers all potential cases outlined in the problem description, including scores from 0 to 99. The annotations also confirm that the code handles scenarios where the score is less than 10, between 10 and 19, and 20 or greater, which aligns with the problem requirements. Additionally, the annotations detail the purpose of the lists used in the program and the logic flow based on the value of the input score. Therefore, based on the code and annotations, it can be concluded that the program is correct and meets the specified problem description.
