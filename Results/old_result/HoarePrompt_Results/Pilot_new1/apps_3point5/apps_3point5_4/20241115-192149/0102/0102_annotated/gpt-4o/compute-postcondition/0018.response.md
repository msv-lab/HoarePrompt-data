The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, where `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. The function also utilizes the variables `ones`, `teens`, and `tens`, which contain string representations of numbers as specified. 

After executing the function body, the function returns the string representation of the number 'n' based on the following conditions:
- If 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the function returns the string representation of 'n' from the `ones` list.
- If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the string representation of 'n' from the `teens` list.
- If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n % 10 == 0, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of 'n' from the `tens` list.
- Otherwise, if 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n % 10 != 0, the function returns the string representation of the number 'n' between 10 and 99 in words, combining the tens and ones places with a hyphen.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` within the specified range and return its string representation based on the given conditions. The function effectively handles all possible scenarios for the given ranges of values and edge cases.
Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n within the range 0 to 99 and returns its string representation based on specified conditions.**
