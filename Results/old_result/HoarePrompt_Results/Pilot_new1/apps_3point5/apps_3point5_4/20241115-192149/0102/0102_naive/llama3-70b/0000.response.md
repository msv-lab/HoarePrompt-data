Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly implements the logic to convert a given integer score into words as per the problem description. It covers all the cases from 0 to 99 and outputs the correct English lowercase letters and hyphens as required. The logic for handling numbers less than 10, numbers between 10 and 19, and numbers greater than 19 is implemented correctly. The program seems to work as expected for all potential cases.
