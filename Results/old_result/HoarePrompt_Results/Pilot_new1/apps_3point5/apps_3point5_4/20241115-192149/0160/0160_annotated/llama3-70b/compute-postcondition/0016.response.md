Output State: **N is at least 2, A is a non-empty list, max_divisor is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A, gcd is at least 1, i is 1. If gcd is divisible by i, then the overall state of the program variables remains the same as the precondition, max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and i.**
