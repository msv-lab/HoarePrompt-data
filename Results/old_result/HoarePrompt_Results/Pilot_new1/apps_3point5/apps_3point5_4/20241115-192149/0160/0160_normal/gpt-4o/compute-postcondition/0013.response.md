Postcondition: ***N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, divisors is a set containing the divisors of x with the results of x // 2 and x added if x % 2 == 0, i is incremented by 1, and if x % i == 0, the set divisors is updated to include i and x // i. The state remains unchanged if x is not divisible by 2.***
