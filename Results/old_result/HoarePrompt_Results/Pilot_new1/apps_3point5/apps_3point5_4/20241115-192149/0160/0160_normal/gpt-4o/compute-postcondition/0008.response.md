Example Answer:
The value of x is divided by i (which is 2) and the result is added to the set divisors. The previous values of divisors, x, and i are unknown, so the output state is: N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, divisors is a set containing the divisors of x with the result of x // 2 added, x is a non-negative integer, i is 2.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i, divisors is a set containing the divisors of x with the result of x // 2 added, x is a non-negative integer, i is 2**
