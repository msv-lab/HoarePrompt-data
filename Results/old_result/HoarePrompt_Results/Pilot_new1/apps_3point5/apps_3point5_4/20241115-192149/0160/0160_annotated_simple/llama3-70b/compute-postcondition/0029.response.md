According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in `A`, and `i` is 3. If `gcd % i` is equal to 0 and `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **N is an integer, gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in A, i is 4**
