Postcondition: ***If N is at least 2, after the execution of the if statement, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, where `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1 and divisible by `i` without remainder. This condition ensures that `max_divisor` is correctly updated under all possible scenarios, covering cases where `gcd % i == 0` and `i * i != gcd`.***
