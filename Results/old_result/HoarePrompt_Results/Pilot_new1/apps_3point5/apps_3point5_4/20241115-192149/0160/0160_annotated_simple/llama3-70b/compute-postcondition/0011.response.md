Example Answer: 
If N is 2 or greater, the loop will execute and `gcd` will be assigned the value of the greatest common divisor of all elements in A. If N is less than 2, the loop won't execute and `gcd` will remain the initial value of A[0]. Therefore, the Output State is: If N is 2 or greater, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in A. If N is less than 2, `gcd` remains the initial value of A[0].
Output State: **If N is 2 or greater, `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in A. If N is less than 2, `gcd` remains the initial value of A[0]**
