Example Answer:
The value of `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`. `divisors` initially contains all the divisors of `x` along with 1. After adding `x // i`, the set `divisors` now contains all the divisors of `x` along with 1 and the result of `x // i`. The value of `i` is 1 and `x` is a positive integer, so the division `x // i` will result in a divisor of `x`. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` along with 1 and the result of `x // i`, `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, square root of `x` is at least 1.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` along with 1 and the result of `x // i`, `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, square root of `x` is at least 1**
