Postcondition: ***N is at least 2, A is a non-empty list, max_divisor is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A, gcd is at least 1, i is 1. If gcd is divisible by i and i * i is not equal to gcd, then the overall state of the program variables remains the same as the precondition, except max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd // i. If gcd is not divisible by i or i * i is equal to gcd, then the program variables retain their initial values as described in the precondition.***
