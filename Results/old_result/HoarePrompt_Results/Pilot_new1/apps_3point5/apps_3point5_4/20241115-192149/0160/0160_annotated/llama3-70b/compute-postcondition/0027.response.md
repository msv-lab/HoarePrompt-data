Postcondition: ***`max_divisor`, `gcd`, `i` are integers. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, `gcd` remains unchanged, and `i` is updated to the new value for the next iteration. If `i * i` is equal to `gcd`, there is no change in the values of `max_divisor`, `gcd`, and `i`.***
