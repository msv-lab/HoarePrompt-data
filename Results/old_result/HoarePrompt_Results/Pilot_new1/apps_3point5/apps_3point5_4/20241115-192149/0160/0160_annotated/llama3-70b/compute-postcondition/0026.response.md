Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, where `gcd` and `i` are variables whose values are not given. The value of `i` is updated for the next iteration. Therefore, the Output State is: `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, `gcd` remains unchanged, `i` is updated to the new value for the next iteration.
Output State: **`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `gcd // i`, `gcd` remains unchanged, `i` is updated to the new value for the next iteration**
