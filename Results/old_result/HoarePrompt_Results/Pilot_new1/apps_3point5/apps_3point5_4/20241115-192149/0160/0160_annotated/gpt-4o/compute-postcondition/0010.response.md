According to the code, the loop will iterate as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1, the result of `x // (i + 1)`, and the value of `i` if `x % i == 0`. The values of `x`, `i + 1`, and the square root of `x` remain unchanged. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1, as the loop will move to the next iteration.
