Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program reads two non-negative integers a and b as strings and removes any leading zeroes. It then compares the two numbers and prints the corresponding symbol ("<", ">", "=") based on the comparison result. The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases mentioned in the problem statement. It handles cases where a < b, a > b, and a = b, including cases where the numbers have leading zeroes. Therefore, the program is correct for all inputs.
