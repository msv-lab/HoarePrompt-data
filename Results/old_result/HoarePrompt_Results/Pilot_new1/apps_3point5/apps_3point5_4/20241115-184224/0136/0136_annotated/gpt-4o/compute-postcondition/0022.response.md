Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the program prints '='. If `a` was initially an empty string, it has been updated to '0'. If `b` was initially an empty string, it has been set to '0'. The length of `a` is not greater than the length of `b`. In the case where `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. In all other cases where `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'.***
