Postcondition: ***a, b are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros. If a < b, then the program prints '<'. If a is not equal to b and a is greater than or equal to b, then the program prints '>'. This covers all possible cases where a and b are compared and the corresponding output is displayed.***
