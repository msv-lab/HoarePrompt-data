Functionality: **The function `func_1` reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings, removes any leading zeros, and compares them. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. The function handles edge cases such as empty strings by treating them as '0'. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
