Example Answer: 
The variable `b` is assigned the value of the input string with leading zeros removed. Since `b` is already a non-negative integer represented as a string, the `lstrip('0')` function does not change its value. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no more than 10^6 digits**
