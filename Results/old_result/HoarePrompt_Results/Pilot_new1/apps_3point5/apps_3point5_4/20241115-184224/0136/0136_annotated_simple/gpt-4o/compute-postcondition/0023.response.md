Postcondition: ***`a`, `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings without leading zeros. If `b` is empty, `b` is assigned the string '0'. If `a` evaluates to False (meaning it is '0'), then `a` is also assigned the string '0'. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to or less than `b`, the program prints '='.***
