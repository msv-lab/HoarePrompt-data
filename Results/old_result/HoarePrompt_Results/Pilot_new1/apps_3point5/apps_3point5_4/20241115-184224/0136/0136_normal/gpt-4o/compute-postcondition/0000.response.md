Example Answer:
The input is split into a list called `data`. The variables `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings, so after splitting the input, `data` contains two elements which are strings representing non-negative integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings**
