Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings without leading zeros. If `a` is an empty string, it is updated to '0'. `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with a value of '0'. In all cases, after the if block executes, `b` is updated to '0'. The length of `a` is less than or equal to the length of `b`. If the value of `a` is less than the value of `b`, the program prints '<'. If the value of `a` is greater than the value of `b`, the program prints '>'. Otherwise, the program prints '='.***
