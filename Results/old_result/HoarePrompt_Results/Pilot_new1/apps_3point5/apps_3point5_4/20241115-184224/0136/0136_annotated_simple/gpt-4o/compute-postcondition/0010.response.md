Output State: **`a`, `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings without leading zeros. If `b` is empty, `b` is assigned the string '0'. If `a` evaluates to False (meaning it is '0'), then `a` is also assigned the string '0'. Otherwise, no changes are made to `a` or `b`. The length of `a` is less than the length of `b`.**
