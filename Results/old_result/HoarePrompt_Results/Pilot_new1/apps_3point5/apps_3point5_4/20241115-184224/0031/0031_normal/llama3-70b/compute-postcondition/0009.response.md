According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (2^(total_days - i))`, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * (2^`, `i` is the next value after the last iteration, `k` remains the same, `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * (2^(total_days - i))`, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * (2^`, `i` is the next value after the last iteration + 1, `k` remains the same, `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days`**
