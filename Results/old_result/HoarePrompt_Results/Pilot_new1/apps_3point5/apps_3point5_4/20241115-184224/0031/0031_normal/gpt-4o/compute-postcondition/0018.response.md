Output State: **If k is greater than 0, `numerator` will be the result of the calculation, `denominator` will be the updated value after multiplying by `total_days` and taking the modulo `MOD`, total_days will be 1, i will be the number of iterations completed. If k is 0 or less, the loop will not execute, and `numerator` will remain 1, `denominator` will remain 1, total_days will be 1, i will be 0.**
