Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both being integers. If `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n`, the program prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, the function calculates values based on `n` and `k` using a loop and a predefined MOD value. It then computes and prints specific values. The function does not return anything unless the mentioned condition is met.**
