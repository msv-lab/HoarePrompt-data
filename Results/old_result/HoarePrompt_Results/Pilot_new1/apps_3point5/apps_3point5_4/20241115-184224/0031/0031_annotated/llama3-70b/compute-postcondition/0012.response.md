According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated as described, `denominator` is updated as described, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0. Since `i` is less than `k`, the loop needs to execute one more time. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated by multiplying the previous value of `numerator` with (`total_days` - 1) multiplied by (`total_days` - 2), `denominator` is updated by multiplying the previous value of `denominator` with `total_days` multiplied by (`total_days` - 1) multiplied by `total_days`, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0**
