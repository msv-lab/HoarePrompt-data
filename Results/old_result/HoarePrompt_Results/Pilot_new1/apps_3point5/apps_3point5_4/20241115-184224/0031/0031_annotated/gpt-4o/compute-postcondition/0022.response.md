Output State: **After the loop executes, `MOD` remains 1000003, `total_days` remains 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` contains the product of all `(total_days - i)` modulo `MOD`, `denominator` contains the product of all `total_days` modulo `MOD`, `i` is the last value of the loop, `k` is greater than 0, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, and `p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`. Finally, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`.**
