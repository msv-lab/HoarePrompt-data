Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday in Udayland as described in the problem statement.
- The function `func_1` accurately calculates the greatest common divisor of two integers using the Euclidean algorithm.
- The function `func_2` correctly handles the cases where `k` is greater than `1 << n` by printing 1, 1 and returning.
- The code then calculates the probability of at least two people sharing the same birthday using the given formula and prints the values of A and B modulo 10^6 + 3.
- The output hints also align with the code and describe the correct calculation of the probability and the reduction of A and B to coprime numbers before printing.
- All the examples provided in the problem statement are correctly handled by the code.
- There are no edge cases or potential scenarios mentioned in the problem description that the code fails to address.
