Output State: **After the loop executes, `MOD` remains 1000003, `total_days` remains 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` will contain the product of all `(total_days - i)` modulo `MOD`, `denominator` will contain the product of all `total_days` modulo `MOD`, `i` is the last value of the loop, `k` is greater than 0. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `numerator` and `denominator` remain 1.**
