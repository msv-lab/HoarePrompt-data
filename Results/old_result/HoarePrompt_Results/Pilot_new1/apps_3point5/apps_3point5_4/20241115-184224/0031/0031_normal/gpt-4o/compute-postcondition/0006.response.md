Example Answer:
`numerator` is assigned the value `1`. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the output state is: MOD is 1000003, if k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, the program prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, total_days is 1 shifted left by n; `numerator` is 1.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, if k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, the program prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, total_days is 1 shifted left by n; `numerator` is 1**
