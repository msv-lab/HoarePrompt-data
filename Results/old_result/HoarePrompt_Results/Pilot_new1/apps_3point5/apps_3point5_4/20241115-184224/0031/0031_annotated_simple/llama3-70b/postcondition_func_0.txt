The function func_1 accepts two integers n and k. It calculates the product of (total_days - i) for each i in the range from 0 to k-1 and stores it in numerator, while updating denominator by multiplying it by total_days each time. After the loop execution, it calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of numerator and denominator, then returns the remainders of numerator and denominator divided by (10^6 + 3). Potential edge cases to consider are when k is less than or equal to 0, where the loop does not execute, and when n or k are outside the specified range of 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18.
