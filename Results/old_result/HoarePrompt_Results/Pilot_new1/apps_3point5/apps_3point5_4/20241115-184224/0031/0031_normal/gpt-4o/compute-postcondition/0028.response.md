The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The parameters `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The function operates with a constant MOD value of 1000003. 

If the value of `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n`, the program prints 1 and 1, then returns. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and if `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n`, it prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, there is no change in the program state.
