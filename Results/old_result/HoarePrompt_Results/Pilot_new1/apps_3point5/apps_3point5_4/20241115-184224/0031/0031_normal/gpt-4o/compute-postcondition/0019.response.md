Output State: **If k is greater than 0, `p_no_shared` will be equal to `numerator`, `numerator` will remain the same, `denominator` will be the updated value after multiplying by `total_days` and taking the modulo `MOD`, total_days will be 1, i will be the number of iterations completed. If k is 0 or less, `p_no_shared` will be 1, `numerator` will remain 1, `denominator` will remain 1, total_days will be 1, i will be 0.**
