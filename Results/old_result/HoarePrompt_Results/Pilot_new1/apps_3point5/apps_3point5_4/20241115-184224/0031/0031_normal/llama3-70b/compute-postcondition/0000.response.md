Example Answer: 
`total_days` is assigned the value `2 ** n`, where n is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18. The value of `total_days` is calculated as 2 raised to the power of `n`. Since the value of `n` can be any integer within the specified range, the output state is: `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`**
