According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000003, total_days is assigned the value of shifting 1 left by n, numerator is updated by multiplying the previous value of numerator with the result of (total_days - 1) modulo MOD, denominator is assigned the value (denominator * total_days) modulo MOD, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0, numerator is updated by multiplying the previous value of numerator with the result of (total_days - 1) modulo MOD, numerator is updated by multiplying the previous value of numerator with the result of (total_days - 1) modulo MOD, denominator is assigned the value (denominator * total_days) modulo MOD**
