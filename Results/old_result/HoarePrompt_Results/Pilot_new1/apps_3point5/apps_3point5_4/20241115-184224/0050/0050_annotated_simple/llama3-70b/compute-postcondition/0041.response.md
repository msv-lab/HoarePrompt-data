Postcondition: ***`m`, `n` are greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of shares and b[i] to r if shares is greater than 0. `shares` is reset to 0, `s` remains a list with elements, `i` is less than `m + 1. If shares is greater than 0, r will be updated and shares will be reset to 0. If shares is not greater than 0, the loop breaks.***
