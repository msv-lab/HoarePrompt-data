Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `r` is at least the largest element in `s`, `shares` contains the total number of shares, `r` is greater than or equal to the current element in `s` at the start of the loop. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is increased by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is less than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
