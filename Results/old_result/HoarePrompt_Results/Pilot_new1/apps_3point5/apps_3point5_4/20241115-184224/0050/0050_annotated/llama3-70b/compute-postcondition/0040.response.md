Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is at least the largest element in `s` plus `shares` multiplied by `b[i+1]` if shares is greater than 0, `shares` contains the total number of shares, `r` is greater than or equal to the current element in `s` at the start of the loop, `i` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
