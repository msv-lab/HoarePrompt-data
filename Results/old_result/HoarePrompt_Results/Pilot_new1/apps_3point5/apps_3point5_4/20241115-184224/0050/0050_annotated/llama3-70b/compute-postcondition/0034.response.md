Example Answer: 
`shares` is assigned the value 0. The value of `shares` is now 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `r` is at least the largest element in `s` plus `shares` multiplied by `b[i]`, `shares` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is at least the largest element in `s` plus `shares` multiplied by `b[i]`, `shares` is 0**
