Example Answer: 
The list `b` is assigned the result of mapping each element of the input split by space to integers. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by space.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers, and `b` is a list of integers obtained from the input split by space**
