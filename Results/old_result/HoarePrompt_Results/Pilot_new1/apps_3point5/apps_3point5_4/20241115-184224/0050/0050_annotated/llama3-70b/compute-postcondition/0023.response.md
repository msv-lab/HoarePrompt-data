According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should still be greater than 0 and `i` should be less than the updated value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is any positive integer, `r` is any positive integer, `shares` is an integer, and `i` is incremented by 1**
