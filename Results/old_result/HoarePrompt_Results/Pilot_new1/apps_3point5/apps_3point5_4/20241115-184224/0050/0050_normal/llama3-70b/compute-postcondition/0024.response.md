Output State: 
- If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once. 
- If `r` is greater than or equal to the current element `s[i]`, `shares` will be incremented by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` will be updated to the remainder of the division of `r` by `s[i]`. 
- If `r` is less than the current element `s[i]`, the loop will break.
- If `n` is 0 or `r` is less than the first element of `s`, the loop won't execute and `shares` will remain 0.
Output State: **If n is greater than 0 and r is greater than or equal to the first element of s, shares is incremented by the floor division of r by s[i] and r is updated to the remainder of the division. If r is less than the first element of s or n is 0, the loop doesn't execute and shares remains 0.**
