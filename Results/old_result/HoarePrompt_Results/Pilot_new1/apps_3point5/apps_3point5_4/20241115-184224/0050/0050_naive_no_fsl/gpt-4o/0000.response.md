Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the maximum number of bourles that can be held after the evening based on the given problem description. It finds the minimum buy price and maximum sell price, then checks if it's profitable to buy and sell shares. If it is profitable, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining bourles, and then calculates the total bourles after selling the shares. The logic seems correct and covers all potential cases described in the problem statement.
