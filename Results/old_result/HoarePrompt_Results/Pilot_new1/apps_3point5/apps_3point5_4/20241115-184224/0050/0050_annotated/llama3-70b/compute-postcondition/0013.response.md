According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` is any positive integer, `r` is any positive integer, `shares` is an integer. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` is any positive integer, `r` is any positive integer, `shares` is an integer, `i` is incremented by 1**
