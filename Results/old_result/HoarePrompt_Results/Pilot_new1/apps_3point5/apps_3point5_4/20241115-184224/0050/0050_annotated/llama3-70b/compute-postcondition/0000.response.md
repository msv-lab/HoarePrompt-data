Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts multiple inputs separated by spaces, `map(int, ...)` converts them to integers, and `n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned those integer values. Since the values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are unknown initially, the output state is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000**
