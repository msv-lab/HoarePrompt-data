Postcondition: ***`shares`, `r`, `i`, `m`, `n` are integers. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. Otherwise, if `shares` is less than or equal to 0, the program breaks. In either case, `i` remains 0, `m` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `r` is greater than or equal to the first element of `s`.***
