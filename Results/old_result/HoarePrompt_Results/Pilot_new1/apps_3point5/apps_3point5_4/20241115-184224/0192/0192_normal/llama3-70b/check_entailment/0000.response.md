Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers from the user input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. This aligns perfectly with the problem description which states that Memory wants to obtain an equilateral triangle of side length y starting from a triangle of side length x by modifying the length of a single side at a time. The code correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to achieve this transformation by finding the absolute difference between the two side lengths. Additionally, the provided examples match the expected output based on the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
