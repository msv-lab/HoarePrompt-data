Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y. It simply calculates the absolute difference between the starting side length x and the target side length y, which represents the number of seconds needed to reach the desired equilateral triangle. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
