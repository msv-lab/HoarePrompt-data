Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending side lengths of an equilateral triangle. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required to transform the triangle from side length x to side length y. The logic used in the program is correct as it calculates the number of seconds by taking the absolute difference between x and y, dividing by 2, and adding the remainder if the difference is odd. This logic covers all possible cases and scenarios as described in the problem statement. The program handles the transformation of the equilateral triangle side lengths accurately for all given inputs.
