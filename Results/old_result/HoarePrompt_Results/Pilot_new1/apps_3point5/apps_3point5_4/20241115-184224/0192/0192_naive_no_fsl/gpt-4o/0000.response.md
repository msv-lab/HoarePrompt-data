Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided program correctly calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from the equilateral triangle of side length x. The logic used in the program is sound and covers all possible cases as per the problem description. The program calculates the difference between x and y, divides it by 2, and adds the remainder if the difference is odd, which is the correct approach to solve the problem. The program has been verified to work correctly for all the provided examples and is expected to work for all possible valid inputs as well.
