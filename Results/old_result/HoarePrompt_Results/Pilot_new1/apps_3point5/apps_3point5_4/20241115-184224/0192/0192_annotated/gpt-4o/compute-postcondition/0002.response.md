The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is designed to calculate and return the sum of all integers between x and y (inclusive) that are divisible by 7 but not divisible by 5, where x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to calculate and return the sum of all integers between x and y that meet the specified conditions.
