Example Answer: 
`x` and `y` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting them to integers. The values of `x` and `y` are now determined by the user input. The constraints ensure that `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
