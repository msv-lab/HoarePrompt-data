Output State: 
- If min_sum is greater than n, the loop does not execute and the variables remain unchanged.
- If the remainder of the division is 0 at any point during the loop, the program stops execution.
- After the loop executes, n and k are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. `i` is the last value of `i` in the loop. `sequence` is modified based on the conditions inside the loop.
