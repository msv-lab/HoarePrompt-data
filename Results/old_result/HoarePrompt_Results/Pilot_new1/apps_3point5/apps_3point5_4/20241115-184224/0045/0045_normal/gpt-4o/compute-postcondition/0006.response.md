Example Answer:
The list `sequence` is created by multiplying each element in the range `k` by `d * (i + 1)`. The previous values of `d` and `k` are known, but `i` is a variable that iterates through the range `k`. Therefore, the output state is: `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers starting from 1, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list containing the elements `[(d * 1), (d * 2), ..., (d * k)]`.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers starting from 1, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`, and `sequence` is a list containing the elements `[(d * 1), (d * 2), ..., (d * k)]`**
