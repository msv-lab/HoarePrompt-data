Example Answer:
`remainder` is decremented by 1. The value of `sequence[i]` is only incremented by 1 if `remainder` is not equal to 0. If `remainder` is 0, then `sequence[i]` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `sequence[i]` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the value of `remainder`, `remainder` is decremented by 1.
Output State: **`sequence[i]` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the value of `remainder`, `remainder` is decremented by 1**
