According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is within the range specified by the for loop statement. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is greater than n, `i` is one less than the current value of `i` at the end of the last iteration. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Since `i` is one less than the current value at the end of the last iteration, it needs to be incremented by 1 to satisfy the loop condition.
2. If the remainder is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the loop. If the remainder is not 0, then `sequence[i]` should be incremented by 1 and `remainder` should be decremented by 1 to continue the execution.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is greater than n, `i` is the current value at the end of the last iteration + 1, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1 if remainder is not 0, `remainder` is decremented by 1 if remainder is not 0**
