Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b`, while `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since the initial state specifies that `a` and `b` are positive integers, the new values of `a` and `b` will be updated accordingly. 
Output State: **a is the previous value of b, b is the remainder of the division of the previous values of a and b.**
