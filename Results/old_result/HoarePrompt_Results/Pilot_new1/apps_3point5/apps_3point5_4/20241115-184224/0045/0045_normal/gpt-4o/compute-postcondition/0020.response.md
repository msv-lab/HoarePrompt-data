Postcondition: ***`sequence[i]` and `sequence[k - 2]` are variables where the value of `sequence[i]` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the value of `remainder`, and the value of `sequence[k - 2]` is either incremented by 1 or remains the same based on the new value of `remainder`. `remainder` is decremented by 2. If `remainder` is 0, the loop or if statement is exited.***
