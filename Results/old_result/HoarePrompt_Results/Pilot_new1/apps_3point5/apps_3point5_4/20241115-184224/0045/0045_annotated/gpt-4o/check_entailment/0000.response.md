Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It calculates the minimum sum based on the value of `k` and then constructs a sequence of `k` positive numbers such that their sum is equal to `n` and the greatest common divisor is maximal. If the minimum sum is greater than `n`, it returns -1 as expected. Otherwise, it distributes the remainder of the division evenly among the elements of the sequence to maximize the greatest common divisor. The code handles all cases as described in the problem statement and the examples provided. The annotations also correctly describe the functionality of the code.
