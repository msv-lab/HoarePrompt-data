According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `b` evaluates to truthy. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` and `b` have been updated based on the calculations, and `b` is still truthy. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to the states for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`a` and `b` have been updated based on the calculations, and `b` is still truthy**
