According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is greater than or equal to 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum`, `n`, `d`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `sequence` has the value at index `i` incremented by 1, `i`, `k` remain the same. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be one less than its current value.
State: **`min_sum`, `n`, `d`, `remainder` is decreased by 1, `sequence` has the value at index `i` incremented by 1, `i` is decreased by 1, `k` remain the same**
