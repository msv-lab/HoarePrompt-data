According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is greater than n. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted such that it is within the range specified by the for loop statement. Since the loop iterates in reverse from `k - 1` to 0, the next iteration would be when `i` is one less than the current value of `i` at the end of the last iteration.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, `min_sum` is greater than n, `i` is one less than the current value of `i` at the end of the last iteration**
