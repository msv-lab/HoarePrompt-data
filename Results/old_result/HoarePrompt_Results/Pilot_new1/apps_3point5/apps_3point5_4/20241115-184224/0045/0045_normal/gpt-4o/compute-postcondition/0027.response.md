Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, calculates the sum of the first `k` positive integers, and returns -1 if this sum is greater than `n`. Otherwise, the function updates a sequence list by decrementing the remainder until it reaches 0 and incrementing some elements based on the initial value of the remainder. **

Note: The code follows the annotations accurately and covers the cases specified.
