Output State: **`candidate` is a valid number according to `is_valid_number`. If `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `is_valid_number`, the function yields `candidate`. If `perm` is not a valid permutation of `chars`, the loop does not execute and no changes are made to the state of the program variables.**
