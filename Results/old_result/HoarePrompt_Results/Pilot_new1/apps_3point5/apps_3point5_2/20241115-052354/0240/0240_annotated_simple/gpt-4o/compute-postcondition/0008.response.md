Postcondition: ***`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one more digit added to it, `sub` is a valid substring of the updated `chars`, and `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` being a substring of it. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to true, then the function yields `candidate`.***
