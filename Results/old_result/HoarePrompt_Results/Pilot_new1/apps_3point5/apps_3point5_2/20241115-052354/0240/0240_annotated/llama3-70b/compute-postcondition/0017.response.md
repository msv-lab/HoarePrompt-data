Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two string parameters s and t. It then iterates through the characters of string s and appends those characters to a new string n if they are also present in string t. After the loop, it appends string t to n and returns the integer value of the resulting string 'n'. If no characters in s are in t, n remains an empty string.**
