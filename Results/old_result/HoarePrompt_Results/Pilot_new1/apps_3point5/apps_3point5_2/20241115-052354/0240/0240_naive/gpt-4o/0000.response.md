Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly handles the problem description by finding the smallest possible initial integer n that Vasya could pass to Kate. It generates all possible numbers using permutations and checks if the remembered substring is present in the number. The logic of the program ensures that the output is the smallest possible integer that satisfies the conditions provided in the problem description. The program also accounts for cases where there are multiple valid solutions and selects the smallest one. Overall, the program aligns with the problem requirements and produces the correct output.
