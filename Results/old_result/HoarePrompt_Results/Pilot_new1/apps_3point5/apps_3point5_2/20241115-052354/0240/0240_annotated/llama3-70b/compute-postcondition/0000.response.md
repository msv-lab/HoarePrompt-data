Example Answer:
The set `t_set` is assigned the set of unique elements in string `t`. The set function creates a set containing distinct elements from string `t`. Since `t` is a string, `t_set` will contain unique characters from `t`. The other variables `s` and `t` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`**
