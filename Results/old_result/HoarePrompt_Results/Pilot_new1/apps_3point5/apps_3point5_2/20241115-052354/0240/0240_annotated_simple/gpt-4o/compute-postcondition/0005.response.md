According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are permutations of the `chars` string. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one digit, `sub` is a valid substring of `chars`, and `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` being a substring of it. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the `chars` string must have at least one more digit added to it, and the `sub` substring and `candidate` number must be adjusted accordingly. Additionally, the permutations of the updated `chars` string must be generated for the next iteration.

State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one more digit added to it, `sub` is a valid substring of the updated `chars`, and `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` being a substring of it**
