Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the `candidate`, which contains the joined permutation of characters in the next permutation of `chars`. The variables `chars`, `sub`, and `candidate` are not directly affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in the next permutation of `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, and `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in the next permutation of `chars`**
