Example Answer:
The value of `n` is updated by adding the next character `c` in the string `s`. The previous value of `n` is unknown, but `c` is a character from the string `s`, so the new value of `n` will be the sum of the previous value of `n` and the ASCII value of `c`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a non-empty string with unique characters, `t_set` is a set created from `t`, `n` is updated based on the next character `c` in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a non-empty string with unique characters, `t_set` is a set created from `t`, `n` is updated based on the next character `c` in `s`**
