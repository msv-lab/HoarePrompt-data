According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `chars` and `sub`. If `chars` is not an empty string and `sub` is a substring of `chars`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `chars` is a string representing a number and `sub` is a string representing a substring of the number, so no adjustments are needed.
State: **Precondition**: **chars is a string representing a number, sub is a string representing a substring of the number**
