Correctness: **False**

The provided code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The code correctly iterates through the characters of string `s` and appends those characters to a new string `n` if they are also present in string `t`. However, the code does not handle the case where leading zeroes are present in the input string `s`. 

For example, if the input is:
```
003512
021
```
The correct output should be `30021`, as the smallest possible initial integer `n` should not have leading zeroes. However, the code will output `3512021` instead, as it does not account for the presence of leading zeroes.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not satisfy the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
