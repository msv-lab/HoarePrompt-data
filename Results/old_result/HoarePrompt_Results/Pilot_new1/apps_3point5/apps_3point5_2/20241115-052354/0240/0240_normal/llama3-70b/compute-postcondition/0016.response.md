The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `t`. `s` is a string representing a very large integer with at most 1,000,000 digits, and `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`. After executing the function body, the program returns the integer value of the concatenated string 'n'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two strings `s` and `t`, and return the integer value of the concatenated string 'n'. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two strings s and t, and returns the integer value of the concatenated string 'n'.**
