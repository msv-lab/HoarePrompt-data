Example Answer:
The value of `n` is updated by adding the character `c` to it. The previous value of `n` is dependent on the previous characters in `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a non-empty string with unique characters, `t_set` is a set created from `t`, and `n` is updated based on the next character `c` in `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a non-empty string with unique characters, `t_set` is a set created from `t`, and `n` is updated based on the next character `c` in `s`**
