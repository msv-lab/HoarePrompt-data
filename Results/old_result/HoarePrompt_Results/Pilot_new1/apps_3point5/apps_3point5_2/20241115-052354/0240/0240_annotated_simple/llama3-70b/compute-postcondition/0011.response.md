Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a non-empty string with unique characters, `t_set` is a set created from `t`, `n` is updated based on the next character `c` in `s`. If the character `c` is in the set `t_set`, then `n` is increased by the value of `c`. Otherwise, there is no change to the values of `s`, `t`, `t_set`, and `n`.***
