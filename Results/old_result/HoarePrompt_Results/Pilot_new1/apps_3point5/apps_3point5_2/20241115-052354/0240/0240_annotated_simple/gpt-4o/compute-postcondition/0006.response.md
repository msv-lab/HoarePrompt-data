Example Answer:
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together. The values of `perm` are not provided in the initial state, so the specific value of `candidate` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one more digit added to it, `sub` is a valid substring of the updated `chars`, and `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` being a substring of it.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least one more digit added to it, `sub` is a valid substring of the updated `chars`, and `candidate` is a valid number with `sub` being a substring of it**
