Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string containing a sequence of digits, `sub` is a substring of `chars`, `candidate` contains the joined permutation of characters in the current `perm`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then the function yields `candidate`. If the loop does not execute, no changes occur in the state of the variables.**
