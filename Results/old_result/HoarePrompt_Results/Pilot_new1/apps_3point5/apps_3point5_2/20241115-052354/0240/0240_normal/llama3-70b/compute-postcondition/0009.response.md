According to the code, the loop will execute until all characters in the string `s` have been processed. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string representing a very large integer with at most 1,000,000 digits, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`, `n` is a string. If the character `c` is present in `t_set`, then `n` contains `c`. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `s` needs to be considered. This means that the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are:
- The next character in `s` should be processed, so the string `s` should be updated to exclude the processed characters.
- If the next character in `s` is present in `t_set`, then `n` should be updated to include that character.

State: **`s` is a string representing the remaining part of the large integer after processing the current character, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`, `n` is a string with the next character included if it is in `t_set`.**
