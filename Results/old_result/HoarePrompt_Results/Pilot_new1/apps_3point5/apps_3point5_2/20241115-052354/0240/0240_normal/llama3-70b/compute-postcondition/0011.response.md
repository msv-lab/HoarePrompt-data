Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing the remaining part of the large integer after processing the current character, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the unique characters of `t`, `n` is a string with the next character included if it is in `t_set`. If the character `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is concatenated with `c`. All other variables retain their original values.***
