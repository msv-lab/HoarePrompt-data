Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts two strings s and t. It creates a set t_set containing the unique characters of string t. Then, it iterates through string s and concatenates characters that are also present in t_set to the string n. Finally, it appends string t to n and returns the integer value of the concatenated string n. If t_set is empty, n remains an empty string. If s is an empty string, n will be equal to t converted to an integer.**
