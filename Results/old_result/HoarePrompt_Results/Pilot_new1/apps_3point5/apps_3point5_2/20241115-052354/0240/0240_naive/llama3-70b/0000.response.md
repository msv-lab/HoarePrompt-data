Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t`, then iterates through `s` to construct the smallest integer `n` by only including the characters that are in the substring `t`. The program then appends the substring `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of `n`. 

The logic of the program seems correct and it correctly follows the problem description. For every input, the program constructs the smallest possible integer `n` based on the remembered substring `t`. The program handles the case where the substring `t` can contain leading zeroes as well. 

Therefore, based on the given problem description and the provided examples, the program appears to be correct.
