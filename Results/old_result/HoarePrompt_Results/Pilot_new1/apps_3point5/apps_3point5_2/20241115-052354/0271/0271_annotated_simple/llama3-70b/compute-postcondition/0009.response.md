Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9. If n % 10 == 0, the program prints n. If n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program prints n - n % 10. If n % 10 is larger than 5, the program prints n + (10 - n % 10). The postcondition ensures that the correct mathematical operation is executed based on the condition of the last digit of n, covering all scenarios where the last digit is either less than or equal to 5 or greater than 5.***
