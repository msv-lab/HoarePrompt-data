Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, determines a result. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is the difference between `n` and the remainder. If the remainder is between 6 and 9, the result is calculated as `n` plus the difference between 10 and the remainder. The function then prints the result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.**
