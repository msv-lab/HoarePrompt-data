Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that n % 10 is not equal to 0. If n % 10 is less than or equal to 5, the program prints n - n % 10. If n % 10 is larger than 5, the program prints n + (10 - n % 10). The overall state of the program after the if else block is executed covers all cases where the last digit of n is either less than or equal to 5 or greater than 5, ensuring that the correct mathematical operation is performed based on the condition.***
