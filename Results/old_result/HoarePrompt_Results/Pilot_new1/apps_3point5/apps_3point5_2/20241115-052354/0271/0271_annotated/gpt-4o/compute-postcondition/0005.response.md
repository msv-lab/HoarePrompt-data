Example Answer: 
`result` is assigned the value of `n` + (10 - `remainder`). Since `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9 and `remainder` is an integer between 6 and 9, the value of `result` will be determined based on these values. 
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 6 and 9, `result` is the sum of `n` and (10 - `remainder`)**
