Example Answer:
The variable `remainder` is assigned the result of `n % 10`, which calculates the remainder of dividing `n` by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, the possible values of `remainder` can be between 0 and 9. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is an integer between 0 and 9.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is an integer between 0 and 9**
