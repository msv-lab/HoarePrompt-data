Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`, where `n` is a non-negative integer and `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9. The value of `remainder` is less than or equal to 5. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is an integer between 0 and 9, remainder is less than or equal to 5, result is the difference between n and remainder.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is an integer between 0 and 9, remainder is less than or equal to 5, result is the difference between n and remainder**
