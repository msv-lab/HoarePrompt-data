Output State: **If all colors in `current_counts` have reached their desired counts as specified in `desired_counts`, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is at least one color where the count in `current_counts` is less than the desired count in `desired_counts`. The loop will continue until this condition is met. If the loop executes and `left` exceeds the length of the colors list, the loop will end without returning 'YES'.**
