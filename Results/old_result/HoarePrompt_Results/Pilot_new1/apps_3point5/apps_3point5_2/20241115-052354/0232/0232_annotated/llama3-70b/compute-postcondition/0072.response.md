Postcondition: ***After incrementing the value of `window_counts[color]` by 1, all counts of colors in `window_counts` remain equal to the corresponding target counts specified in `counts`. If this condition is met, `found` is set to True, and the loop is broken. The program ensures that the counts of colors in `window_counts` remain consistent with the target counts specified in `counts` after the increment operation, leading to the termination of the loop.***
