Example Answer:
`color_counts[color]` is assigned the value 0 for the given color. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `m` are positive integers, `counts` contains the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, `colors` is a non-empty list of colors with at least one more color left to iterate over, and `color_counts[color]` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers, `counts` contains the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, `colors` is a non-empty list of colors with at least one more color left to iterate over, `color_counts[color]` is 0**
