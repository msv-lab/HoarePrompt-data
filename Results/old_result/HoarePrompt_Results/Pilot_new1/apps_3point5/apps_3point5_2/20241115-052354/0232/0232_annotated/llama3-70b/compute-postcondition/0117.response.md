Output State: **After the loop executes, `window_counts` will be updated with the counts of colors encountered. `found` will be set to True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts` after sorting. `i` will be reset to its initial value. `n` will remain greater than or equal to `i`. `color` will be assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, it will be added with a count of 0. If the loop does not execute, `found` will remain False.**
