Postcondition: ***After the loop executes, the program iterates over a range of values from `i` to `n`, where `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, it is added to the dictionary with a count of 0. The count of `color` in `window_counts` is then incremented by 1. If all counts of colors in `window_counts` match the target counts specified in `counts`, `found` is set to True, and the loop is terminated. If the loop does not execute due to `i` being greater than or equal to `n`, no changes are made to the variables. When the condition `(found)` is true, the overall state of the program remains the same as described in the precondition.***
