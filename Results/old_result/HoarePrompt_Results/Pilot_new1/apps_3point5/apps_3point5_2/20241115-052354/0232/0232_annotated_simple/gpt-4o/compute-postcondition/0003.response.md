According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is a valid range value. Before the loop starts, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0 and `left` is 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `right` should be set to 0 and `n` should be greater than 0.
State: **`current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
