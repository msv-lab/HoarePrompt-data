Postcondition: ***`colors` is a non-empty list, `counts` remains unchanged, `color_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of each unique color in the `colors` list, `found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary where the color `color` is present with a count of 0 if it was not already in `window_counts`, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, and `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list. The program fragment ensures that the color `color` is added to `window_counts` with a count of 0 if it was not already present, maintaining the initial state of the program variables.***
