Example Answer: 
A new key-value pair is added to the dictionary `color_counts`, where the key is `color` and the value is `0`. The dictionary `color_counts` already had at least one key-value pair, so after execution, it will have one more key-value pair with the same key but a value of `0`. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of integers containing the user input values, `counts` is a list of integers from user input, `color_counts` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers containing the user input values, `counts` is a list of integers from user input, `color_counts` is a dictionary with at least two key-value pairs**
