Postcondition: ***`colors` is a list of integers containing the user input values, `counts` is a list of integers from user input, `color_counts` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. If the color is not present in the `color_counts` dictionary, a new key-value pair is added to `color_counts` where the value is 0. The state of the program after the if else block is that the `color_counts` dictionary has been updated to include the new color with a value of 0. All other variables remain unchanged.***
