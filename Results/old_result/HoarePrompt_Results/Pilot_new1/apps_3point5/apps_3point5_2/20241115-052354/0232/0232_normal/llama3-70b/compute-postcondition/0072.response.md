Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where the `color` key is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. This ensures that the program has successfully checked if all counts match the targets in the dictionary `window_counts` after incrementing the color key.***
