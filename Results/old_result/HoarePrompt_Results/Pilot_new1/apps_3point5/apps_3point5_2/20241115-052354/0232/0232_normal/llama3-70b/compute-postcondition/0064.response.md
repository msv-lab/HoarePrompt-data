Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary where the `color` key is incremented by 1, `i` is 0, and `n` is greater than or equal to 0. If all values in the `window_counts` dictionary are equal to their corresponding values in the `counts` list after sorting, then `found` is True and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
