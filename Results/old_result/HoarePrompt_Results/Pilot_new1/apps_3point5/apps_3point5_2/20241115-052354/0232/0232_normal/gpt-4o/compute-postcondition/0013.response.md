Postcondition: ***`desired_counts` is a dictionary representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, `current_counts` is updated with the incremented value, `left` is 0, and `right` is n. If all colors in `current_counts` have reached their desired counts as specified in `desired_counts`, then the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, there is at least one color where the count in `current_counts` is less than the desired count in `desired_counts`.***
