Postcondition: ***After the increment operation, if `color` is not in `window_counts`, all counts of colors in `window_counts` are reset to 0. `found` is set to True, and the loop is broken. `j` is less than `n`. `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. In all cases, the counts of colors in `window_counts` remain consistent with the target counts specified in `counts` after the increment operation, ensuring the termination of the loop.***
