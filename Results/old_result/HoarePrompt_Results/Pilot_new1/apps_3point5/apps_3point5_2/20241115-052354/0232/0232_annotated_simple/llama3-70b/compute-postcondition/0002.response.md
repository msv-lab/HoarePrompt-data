Example Answer:
The list `counts` is assigned the result of converting the input to a list of integers. The input is split by spaces and converted to integers. The previous values of `n` and `m` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, and `counts` contains the desired counts of lightsabers of each color.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is a positive integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, `counts` contains the desired counts of lightsabers of each color**
