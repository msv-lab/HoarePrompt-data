Correctness: **True**

The program correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It iterates through the list of colors of the Jedi Knights and checks if there is a contiguous interval that matches the desired counts of lightsabers for each color. The program returns 'YES' if such an interval is found, otherwise it returns 'NO'. The implementation covers all potential cases and correctly determines whether an interval with the prescribed color counts exists.
