Output State: **The loop iterates through the colors list, updating the window_counts dictionary with the count of each color. If all counts in window_counts match the counts list, found is set to True and the loop breaks. If the loop does not execute, found remains False. After the loop executes, colors, counts, color_counts, and n remain unchanged. window_counts contains the count of each color encountered during the loop iterations.**
