Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary with at least one key-value pair. If the `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. The variables `i` and `n` satisfy the condition where `i` is less than `n`, and `n` is greater than or equal to `i`. Additionally, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, where `colors` has at least `n` elements.***
