You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: There is unrest in the Galactic Senate. Several thousand solar systems have declared their intentions to leave the Republic. Master Heidi needs to select the Jedi Knights who will go on peacekeeping missions throughout the galaxy. It is well-known that the success of any peacekeeping mission depends on the colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi who will go on that mission. 

Heidi has n Jedi Knights standing in front of her, each one with a lightsaber of one of m possible colors. She knows that for the mission to be the most effective, she needs to select some contiguous interval of knights such that there are exactly k_1 knights with lightsabers of the first color, k_2 knights with lightsabers of the second color, ..., k_{m} knights with lightsabers of the m-th color. Help her find out if this is possible.


-----Input-----

The first line of the input contains n (1 ≤ n ≤ 100) and m (1 ≤ m ≤ n). The second line contains n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m} representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights. The third line contains m integers k_1, k_2, ..., k_{m} (with $1 \leq \sum_{i = 1}^{m} k_{i} \leq n$) – the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m.


-----Output-----

Output YES if an interval with prescribed color counts exists, or output NO if there is none.


-----Example-----
Input
5 2
1 1 2 2 1
1 2

Output
YES
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n, m = map(int, input().split())
    colors = list(map(int, input().split()))
    counts = list(map(int, input().split()))
    color_counts = {}
    for color in colors:
        if color not in color_counts:
            color_counts[color] = 0
        
        color_counts[color] += 1
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: 
    #The loop iterates over a list of colors and updates a dictionary `color_counts` with the count of each color. If a color is not already in `color_counts`, it is added with a count of 0 before being incremented by 1. 
    #If the list of colors is empty, the loop does not execute, and `color_counts` remains empty. 
    #Overall, after the loop executes, `n` and `m` are positive integers, `counts` contains the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, `colors` is a non-empty list of colors, and `color_counts` contains the counts of each color.
    found = False
    for i in range(n):
        window_counts = {}
        
        for j in range(i, n):
            color = colors[j]
            if color not in window_counts:
                window_counts[color] = 0
            window_counts[color] += 1
            if all(count == target for count, target in zip(sorted(window_counts.
                values()), counts)):
                found = True
                break
        
        if found:
            break
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: After the loop executes, `found` is a boolean value indicating whether the desired counts of lightsabers of each color have been found. `n` and `m` are positive integers. `counts` contains the desired counts of lightsabers of each color. `colors` is a non-empty list of colors. `color_counts` contains the counts of each color. `i` is the index of the outer loop. `window_counts` is a dictionary with colors as keys and their respective counts as values. If the loop does not execute, `found` remains False and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary.
    print('YES' if found else 'NO')

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
