Example Answer: 
`left` is assigned the value 0. The value of `current_counts` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, and it remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0.
Output State: **`current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0**
