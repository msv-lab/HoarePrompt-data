Output State: **`found` is a boolean value indicating whether the desired counts of lightsabers of each color have been found, `n` and `m` are positive integers, `counts` contains the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, `colors` is a non-empty list of colors, `color_counts` contains the counts of each color, `i` is 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` as key and the count of `color` incremented by 1, `j` is equal to `i` + 1, `color` is the color at index `j` in the list `colors`, and `color` is assigned the value of the color at index `j` in the list `colors. If the color is not in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0. If all counts in `window_counts` match the target counts in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop breaks, `j` is less than `n - 1, `color` is the color at index `j` in the list `colors.**
