Postcondition: ***After the if statement executes, if all the counts of colors in `window_counts` match the target counts specified in `counts`, `found` is set to True, and the loop is terminated. In the case where the counts do not match, the program continues without any changes to the variables. The condition ensures that the loop is terminated correctly and that `found` is updated appropriately based on the comparison of counts.***
