Output State: **If `n` is at least 2, the loop checks if the characters at indices `i` and `n - i - 1` in string `s` are equal for each iteration up to `n // 2`. If at any point they are not equal, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop is terminated. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute.**
