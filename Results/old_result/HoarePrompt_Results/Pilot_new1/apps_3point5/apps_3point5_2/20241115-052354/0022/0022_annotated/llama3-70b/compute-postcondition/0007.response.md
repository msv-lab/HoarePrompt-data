Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop or if statement is terminated. The program handles the case where the characters at indices `i` and `n - i - 1` in `s` are not equal, ensuring `is_spalindrome` is updated to False and the loop is broken.***
