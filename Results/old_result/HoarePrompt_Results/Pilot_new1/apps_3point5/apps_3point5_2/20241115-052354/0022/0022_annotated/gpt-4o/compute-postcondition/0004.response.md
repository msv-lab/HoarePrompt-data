Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of string `s`, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. In all other cases where the characters at the corresponding indices are equal, the function does not return anything.***
