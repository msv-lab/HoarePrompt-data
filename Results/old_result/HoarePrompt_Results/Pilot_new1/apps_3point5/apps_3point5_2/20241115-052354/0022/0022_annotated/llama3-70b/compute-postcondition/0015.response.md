Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length at least 2, `n` is at least 2, `i` is less than `n // 2 + 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop or if statement is exited. This condition covers the scenario where the string `s` is not a palindrome at the specified indices `i` and `n - i - 1`.***
