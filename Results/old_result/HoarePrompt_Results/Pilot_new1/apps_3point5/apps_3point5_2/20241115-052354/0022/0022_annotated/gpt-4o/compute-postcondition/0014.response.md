The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, inclusive. 

After executing the function body, if the length of string `s` is odd, the loop won't execute as n // 2 will be the floor division of an odd number resulting in a non-integer value. If the length of string `s` is even, the loop will compare characters from the beginning and end of the string towards the middle. If any pair of characters at corresponding indices is not equal, the function returns False. 

If all pairs of characters are equal, the function returns True. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` of English letters and return True if all pairs of characters at corresponding indices are equal, and return False if any pair of characters is not equal.
