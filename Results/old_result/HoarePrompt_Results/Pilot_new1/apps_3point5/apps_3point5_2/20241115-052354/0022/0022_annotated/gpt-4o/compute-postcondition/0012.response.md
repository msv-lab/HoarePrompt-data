Output State: **If the length of string s is odd, the loop won't execute as n // 2 will be the floor division of an odd number resulting in a non-integer value. If the length of string s is even, the loop will compare characters from the beginning and end of the string towards the middle. If any pair of characters at corresponding indices is not equal, the function returns False.**
