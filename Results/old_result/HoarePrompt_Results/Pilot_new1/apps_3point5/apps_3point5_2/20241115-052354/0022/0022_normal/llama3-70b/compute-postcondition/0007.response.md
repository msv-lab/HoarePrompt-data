Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of even length between 2 and 1000, `n` is an even integer. If the characters at index `i` and `n - i - 1` of string `s` are not equal, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop or if statement is exited. The program handles all edge cases for the given conditions and accurately updates the state of `is_spalindrome` based on the comparison of characters in `s`.***
