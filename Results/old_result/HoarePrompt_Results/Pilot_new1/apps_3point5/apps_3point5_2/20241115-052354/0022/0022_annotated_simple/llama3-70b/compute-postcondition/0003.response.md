According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n // 2` is at least 1. Since `n` is the length of string `s`, and `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, the loop will execute. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, containing only English letters; `n` is the length of `s`, and `is_spalindrome` is True**
