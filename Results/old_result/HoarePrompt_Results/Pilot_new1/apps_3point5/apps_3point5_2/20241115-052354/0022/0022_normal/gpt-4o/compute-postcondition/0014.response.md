The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of length between 1 and 1000 containing only English letters. The function also utilizes variables `n` and `i`, where `n` is at least 2 and `i` is less than `n//2`. 

In Case 1, if `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - 1 - i]`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `s`, `n`, and `i`. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute.

In Case 2, the program returns True. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` of English letters and determine if the string is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards) by comparing characters at symmetric positions within the string. If it is a palindrome, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False.
