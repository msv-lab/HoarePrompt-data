The function `func` reads three integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from input. It then checks the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` based on certain conditions and prints specific characters ('+', '-', '0', or '?') accordingly. The function assumes that `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers within the range [0, 100]. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, it prints '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints '-'. If `x` is equal to `y`, it further checks if `z` is 0 and prints '0', otherwise it prints '?'. If `x` is not equal to `y`, it prints '?'.
