Postcondition: ***min_upvotes, max_upvotes, min_downvotes, max_downvotes are integers where min_upvotes is assigned the value of x, max_upvotes is x + z, min_downvotes is assigned the value of y, max_downvotes is y + z. Additionally, max_upvotes is not less than min_downvotes. If max_downvotes is less than min_upvotes, the program prints '+'. Otherwise, the program prints '?'.***
