Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- If `x` is greater than `y + z`, then the result is definitely "+", as there are more upvotes.
- If `x` is less than `y`, then the result is definitely "-", as there are more downvotes.
- If `x` is equal to `y`, then if `z` is 0, the result is definitely "0". If `z` is not 0, then the result is uncertain, which is correctly handled by printing "?".
- In all other cases, the result is uncertain, which is also correctly handled by printing "?". 

The code covers all possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
