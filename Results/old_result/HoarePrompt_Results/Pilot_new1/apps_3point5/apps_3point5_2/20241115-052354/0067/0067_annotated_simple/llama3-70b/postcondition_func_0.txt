The function `func` reads three non-negative integers `x`, `y`, and `z` from the user input. It then compares the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` and prints different symbols based on the comparisons. If `x` is greater than the sum of `y` and `z`, it prints '+'. If `x` is less than `y`, it prints '-'. If `x` equals `y` and `z` equals 0, it prints '0'. If `x` equals `y` and `z` is not 0, it prints '?'. If none of the above conditions are met, it prints '?'. The function does not return any value.
