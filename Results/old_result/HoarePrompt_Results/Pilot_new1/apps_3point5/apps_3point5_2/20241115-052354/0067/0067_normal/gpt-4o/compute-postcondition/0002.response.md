Example Answer:
`max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, where `x` and `z` are non-negative integers. Since `min_upvotes` is already assigned the value of `x`, and `x` and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, the value of `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z` which are between 0 and 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, and `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, and `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`**
