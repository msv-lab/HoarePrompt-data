Example Answer:
`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`, where `input().split()` accepts multiple inputs separated by spaces, `int` converts them to integers, and `map` applies the `int` function to each input. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are updated based on the input values. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
