Example Answer:
`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned values from the input after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. Since the values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers in the range 0 to 100, the output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
