Postcondition: ***min_upvotes, max_upvotes, min_downvotes, max_downvotes are integers where min_upvotes is assigned the value of x, max_upvotes is x + z, min_downvotes is assigned the value of y, max_downvotes is y + z. If max_upvotes is less than min_downvotes, the program prints '-'. If max_downvotes is less than min_upvotes, the program prints '+'. If neither condition is met, the program prints '?'.***
