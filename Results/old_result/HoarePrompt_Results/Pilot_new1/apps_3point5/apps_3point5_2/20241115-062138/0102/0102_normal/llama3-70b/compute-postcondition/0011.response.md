Postcondition: ***s is an input integer such that 10 <= s <= 99; ones is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine, tens is a list of strings representing tens from twenty to ninety. If s < 20, the code prints the string representation of the number corresponding to the input integer s minus 10 from the list of teens. Otherwise, the code prints the string representation of the input integer s in words, considering all possible cases and edge scenarios within the specified range of values for s.***
