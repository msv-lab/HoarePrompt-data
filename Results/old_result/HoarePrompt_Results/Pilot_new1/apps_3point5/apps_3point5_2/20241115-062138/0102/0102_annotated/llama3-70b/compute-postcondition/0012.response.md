Postcondition: ***s is an input integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; ones is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine, tens is a list of strings representing tens from twenty to ninety. If s < 10, the code prints the string at index s from the list ones. If 10 ≤ s < 20, the code prints the string at index s - 10 from the list teens. If s is between 20 and 99, the code prints the concatenation of the string at index s // 10 from the list tens and the string at index s % 10 from the list ones, separated by a hyphen if s % 10 is not zero. The postcondition covers all edge cases for the given program fragment, ensuring the correct output based on the input integer s.***
