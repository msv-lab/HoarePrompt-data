Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes an integer input representing Tavas's score and correctly converts it into words as required by the problem description. It covers all cases from 0 to 99, including special cases such as 10, 20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90. The logic implemented in the code ensures that the output is in accordance with the English numerals as specified in the problem description. The code also includes annotations that describe the logic and the state of the program after execution. Since there are no cases identified where the program does not work as expected, the correctness is True.
