Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer where 10 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `tens` is a list of string representations of tens from empty string to ninety. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the program returns the string representation of the number in the 'teens' list at index n - 10. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not in the range of 11 to 19, if n % 10 == 0, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of the integer 'n'. Otherwise, the function returns the string representation of the number `n` in words by combining the tens and ones place representations. The program accurately handles all edge cases and correctly converts the given integer `n` to its corresponding word representation.***
