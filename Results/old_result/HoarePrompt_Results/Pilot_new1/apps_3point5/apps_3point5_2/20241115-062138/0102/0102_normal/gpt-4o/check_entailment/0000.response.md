Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. The function `func_1` takes an integer parameter `n` and returns the string representation of `n` in words. The code handles cases where `n` is between 0 and 9, 11 and 19, and 10 and 99 by utilizing the lists `ones`, `teens`, and `tens` respectively. The code correctly converts the integer `n` to its word representation within the specified ranges. The output hints also agree with the code and confirm that it handles the cases as described in the problem description. Since the code works as expected for all valid inputs and edge cases, the correctness is True.
