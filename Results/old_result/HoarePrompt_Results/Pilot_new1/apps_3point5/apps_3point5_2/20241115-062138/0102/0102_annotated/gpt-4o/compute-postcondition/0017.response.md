Postcondition: ***ones, teens, tens are lists containing string representations of numbers from zero to nine, eleven to nineteen, and ten to ninety respectively. n is an integer. If n is between 0 and 9, the program returns the string representation of the number n from the 'ones' list. If n is between 11 and 19, the program returns the string representation of the number n from the 'teens' list. If n is between 10 and 99, excluding the range of 11 to 19, the program returns the string representation of the tens digit of n if n % 10 == 0. Otherwise, it returns the concatenation of the string representation of the tens digit and the ones digit of n separated by a hyphen. The postcondition ensures the correct representation of the number in words for all possible values of n within the specified ranges.***
