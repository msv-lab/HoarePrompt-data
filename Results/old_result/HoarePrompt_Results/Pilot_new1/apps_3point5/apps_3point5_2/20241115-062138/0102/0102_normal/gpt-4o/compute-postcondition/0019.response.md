Functionality: ** The function `func_1` takes an integer parameter `n` and returns the string representation of `n` in words. The function considers different ranges of `n` to determine the appropriate string representation based on predefined lists of numbers. It handles cases where `n` is between 0 and 9, 11 and 19, and 10 and 99 by utilizing the lists `ones`, `teens`, and `tens`. The function properly converts the integer `n` to its word representation within the specified ranges. **
