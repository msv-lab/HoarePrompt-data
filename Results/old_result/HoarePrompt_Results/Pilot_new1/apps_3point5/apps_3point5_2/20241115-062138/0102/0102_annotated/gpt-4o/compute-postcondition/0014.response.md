Postcondition: ***ones, teens, tens are lists containing string representations of numbers from zero to nine, eleven to nineteen, and ten to ninety respectively. n is an integer between 10 and 99, excluding the range of 11 to 19. If n % 10 == 0, the program returns the string representation of the tens digit of n. Otherwise, the program returns the concatenation of the string representation of the tens digit and the ones digit of n separated by a hyphen. The postcondition covers all cases within the specified range of n and ensures the correct representation of the number in words.***
