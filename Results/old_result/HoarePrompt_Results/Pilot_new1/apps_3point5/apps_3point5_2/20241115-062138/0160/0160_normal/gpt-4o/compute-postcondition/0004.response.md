Example Answer:
`divisors` is a set that contains factors of `x`, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is 1. After executing the code, the value of `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`. 
Output State: **`divisors` is a set that contains factors of `x`, `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 1, and the result of `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`**
