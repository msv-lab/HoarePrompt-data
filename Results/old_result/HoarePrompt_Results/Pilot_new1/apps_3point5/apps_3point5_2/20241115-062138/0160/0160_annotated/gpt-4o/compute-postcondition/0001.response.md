According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of x is such that int(math.sqrt(x)) is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the set divisors is empty. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **`divisors` is an empty set, `x` is a value such that int(math.sqrt(x)) is greater than 0, `i` is 1**
