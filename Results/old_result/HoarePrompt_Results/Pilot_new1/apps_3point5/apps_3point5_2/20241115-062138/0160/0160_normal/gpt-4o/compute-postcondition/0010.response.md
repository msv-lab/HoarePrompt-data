According to the code, the loop can execute one more time if the condition `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))` is satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing factors of `x` and `x` is greater than or equal to 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1` and `x` needs to be adjusted to the same value as it was at the end of the previous iteration. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`divisors` is a set containing factors of `x`, where `x` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is one more than the previous value, `x` remains the same**
