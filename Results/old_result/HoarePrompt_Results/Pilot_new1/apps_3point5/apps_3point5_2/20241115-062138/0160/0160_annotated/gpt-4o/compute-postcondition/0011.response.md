Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`, and `i` is the next integer after the previous `i`. Therefore, the new value of `i` is added to the set. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing the factors of `x` and `x // 1`, with the updated `i` added to it and `x // updated i` added as divisors if `x` is divisible by `updated i`**
