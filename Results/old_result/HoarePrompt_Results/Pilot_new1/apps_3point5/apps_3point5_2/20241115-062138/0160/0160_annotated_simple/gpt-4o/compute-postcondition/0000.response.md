Example Answer:
The set `divisors` is initialized as an empty set. Since the initial values of N, K, and A_i are not affected by this code snippet, the output state is:
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for all i from 1 to N.**
