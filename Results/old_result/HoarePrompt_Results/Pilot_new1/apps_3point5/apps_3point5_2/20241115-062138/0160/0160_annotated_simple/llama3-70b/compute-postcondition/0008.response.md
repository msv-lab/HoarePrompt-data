Example Answer:
The variable `gcd` is updated by taking the greatest common divisor of the current value of `gcd` and the ith element of list A. The value of `gcd` is updated iteratively for each element in list A. Therefore, the Output State is: N is an integer between 2 and 501, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9; A is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A.
Output State: **N is an integer between 2 and 501, K is an integer between 0 and 10^9; A is a non-empty list of integers obtained from input, and `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A**
