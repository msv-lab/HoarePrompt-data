Example Answer:
The value of `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` contains factors of `x` and `x // 1` with the updated `i` added to it. If `x` is divisible by `updated i`, then `x // updated i` is also added as divisors. 
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing the factors of `x`, `x // 1`, and `x // i`**
