According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_divisor` is a positive integer, `gcd` is a positive integer, and `i` is 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Additionally, if `gcd` is divisible by `i`, then `max_divisor` should be updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and `i`. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` should be further updated to the maximum value between the previous `max_divisor` and the result of dividing `gcd` by `i`.

State: **`max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, `gcd` is a positive integer, and `i` is incremented by 1**
