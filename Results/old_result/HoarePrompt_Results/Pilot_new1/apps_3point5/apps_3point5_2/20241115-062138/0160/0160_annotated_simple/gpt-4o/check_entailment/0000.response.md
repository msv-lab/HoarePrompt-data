Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. Function 1 correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list A, which is essential for finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
2. Function 2 correctly finds all the divisors of a given integer x and returns them in reverse order, which is required for determining the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A.
3. Both functions handle the edge cases and constraints mentioned in the problem description.
4. The program logic aligns with the problem description and should work correctly for all potential cases.
