Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set containing the factors of `x` and `x // i`, where `x` is a value such that int(math.sqrt(x)) is greater than 0, and `i` is 1. The set `divisors` is updated with the factors of `x` and the result of `x` divided by `i`. All possible factor pairs of `x` are added to the set `divisors` after the execution of the if statement.***
