Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing factors of `x`, where `x` is greater than or equal to 1. The set `divisors` includes both the factors `i` and `x // i` if `x` is divisible by `i`. If `x` is not divisible by any number in the range, the loop does not execute and `divisors` remains an empty set.**
