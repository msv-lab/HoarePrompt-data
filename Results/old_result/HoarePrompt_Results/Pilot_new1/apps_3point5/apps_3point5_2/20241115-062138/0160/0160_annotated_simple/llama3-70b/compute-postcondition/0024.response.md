According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, `gcd` is a positive integer, and `i` is incremented by 1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the conditions for updating `max_divisor` need to be checked. If `gcd % (i + 1) == 0`, then `max_divisor` should be updated accordingly. If `(i + 1) * (i + 1) != gcd`, then `max_divisor` should be updated based on this condition as well.
State: **`max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions in the loop, `gcd` is a positive integer, and `i` is incremented by 1**
