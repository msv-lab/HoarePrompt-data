The function `func_2` accepts an integer parameter `x` within the range 2 <= x <= 500. It then calculates the set of divisors of `x` by iterating over the range from 1 to the square root of `x`. The function adds factors `i` and `x // i` to the set `divisors` if `x` is divisible by `i`. Finally, it returns the set `divisors` sorted in descending order. The functionality does not account for edge cases where `x` is less than 2 or greater than 500, which could lead to unexpected results.
