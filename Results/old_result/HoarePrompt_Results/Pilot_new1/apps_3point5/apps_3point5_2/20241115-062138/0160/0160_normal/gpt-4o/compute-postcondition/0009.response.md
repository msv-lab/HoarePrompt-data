Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set containing factors of `x`, where `x` is greater than or equal to 1. If `x` is divisible by `i`, both `i` and `x // i` are added to the set `divisors`. This process covers all possible factors of `x` including the edge cases where `i` is the smallest factor of `x` and `x // i` is the largest factor of `x`.***
