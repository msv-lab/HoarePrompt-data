Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the elements in A and then finds the divisors of the sum of all elements in A. It then iterates through the divisors and checks if each divisor satisfies the condition that it divides every element of A after the operations. If a divisor is found that satisfies this condition, it is printed as the output.

The program handles all potential cases by checking if a divisor can divide every element of A after the operations. Since this check is done for all divisors, the program covers all possible scenarios and outputs the correct result.
