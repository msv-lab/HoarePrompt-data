Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The function func_1 correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in a list of positive integers, which is needed to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
2. The function func_2 correctly calculates all the factors of a given positive integer x along with their pairs in descending order, which helps in determining the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
3. Both functions adhere to the problem description and handle the potential cases mentioned in the problem statement. The code annotations also align with the logic implemented in the functions.
4. The program overall meets the requirements of the problem description and provides the correct output based on the given input.
