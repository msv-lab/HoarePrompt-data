Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program iterates through all the bus routes and calculates the wait time for each route based on the given time Serval goes to the station.
2. It then chooses the route with the minimum wait time, which aligns with the problem description where Serval will choose the bus route with the minimum wait time.
3. The program correctly handles the edge cases where the first bus of a route arrives after Serval goes to the station, ensuring a non-negative wait time.
4. The logic of choosing the route based on the minimum wait time is correctly implemented.
5. The program returns the chosen route as required by the problem description.
