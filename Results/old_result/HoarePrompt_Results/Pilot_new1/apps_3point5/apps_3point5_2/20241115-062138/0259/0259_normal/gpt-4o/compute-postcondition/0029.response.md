Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of `s_i - t`, where `s_i` and `t` are not defined in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `n` is greater than `i + 1`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `n` is greater than `i + 1**
