Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if block, the state of the program variables is as follows: `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum wait time, which is updated to the new value of `wait_time` if `wait_time` is less than the current `min_wait_time`. `chosen_route` is an integer representing the route chosen based on the minimum wait time, and it is updated to `i + 1` if `wait_time` is less than the current `min_wait_time`. The values of `i`, `n`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `wait_time` remain the same. This postcondition covers the scenarios where `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, ensuring the correct updating of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route`, while maintaining the initial values of other variables.***
