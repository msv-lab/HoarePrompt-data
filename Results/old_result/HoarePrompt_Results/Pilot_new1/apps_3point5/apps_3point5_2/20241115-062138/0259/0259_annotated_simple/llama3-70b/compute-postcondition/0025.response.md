Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `ans` is either -1 or i + 1 where i is the index of the tuple in the list, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the first tuple in the list, `time` is the result of the calculation (t - s) % d, and `min_time` is assigned the minimum value of `time` among all calculations. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is updated to i + 1. The overall state of the program after the if else block executes covers all edge cases, ensuring that the minimum time and the corresponding index are correctly updated based on the conditions stated.***
