The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `n`, `t`, and `bus_routes`. 
- `n` is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes.
- `t` is a positive integer representing the current time.
- `bus_routes` is a list containing tuples where each tuple represents a bus route with two elements: the arrival time `s_i` and the interval between two buses `d_i`.

After executing the function body, the program returns the route number corresponding to the minimum wait time calculated based on the current time `t` and the bus routes provided. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept the number of bus routes `n`, the current time `t`, and a list of bus routes `bus_routes`, and return the route number with the minimum wait time.
