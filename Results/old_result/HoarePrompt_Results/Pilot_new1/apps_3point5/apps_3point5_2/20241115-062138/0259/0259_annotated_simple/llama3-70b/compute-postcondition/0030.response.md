Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `i` is the index of the next tuple in the list, `s` and `d` are the values of the next tuple in the list, `time` is the result of the calculation (t - s) % d, `min_time` is assigned the minimum value of `time` among all calculations, and `ans` is either -1 or i + 1 where i is the index of the tuple in the list incremented by 1. If the calculated `time` is less than the current `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to `time` and `ans` is updated to i + 1. This ensures that `min_time` holds the minimum value of all `time` calculations, and `ans` reflects the index of the tuple with the minimum `time` value.***
