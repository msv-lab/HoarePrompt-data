Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for the number of buses `n`, current time `t`, start time `s`, and duration `d` for each bus. It then calculates the time taken for each bus to reach its destination based on the current time and schedules. After processing all buses, it prints the index of the bus that will reach its destination in the shortest time. However, the function is missing necessary input parameters to perform any computation, so it does not return any value.**
