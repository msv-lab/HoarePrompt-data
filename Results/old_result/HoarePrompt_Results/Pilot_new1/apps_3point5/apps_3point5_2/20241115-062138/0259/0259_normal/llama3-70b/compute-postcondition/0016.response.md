Example Answer:
The variable `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, where `t` is a positive integer, `s` is the starting time of the first bus, and `d` is the time interval between buses. The value of `time` will be the remainder of `(t - s)` divided by `d`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains at least one tuple, `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in `buses`, and `time` is calculated as described.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer such that 1 <= t <= 10^5, `buses` contains at least one tuple, `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `i` is 0, `(s, d)` is the first tuple in `buses`, `time` is calculated as described**
