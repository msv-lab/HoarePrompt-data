According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity and `chosen_route` is assigned the value -1. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 0, `min_wait_time` needs to remain positive infinity, `chosen_route` should stay assigned the value -1, and `i` should be set to 0.
State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
