Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes input for the number of bus routes `n` and the time Serval goes to the station `t`, and then reads the schedules for each bus route.
- It correctly calculates the waiting time for each bus route based on the input schedules and finds the bus route with the minimum waiting time.
- The code outputs the index of the bus route with the minimum waiting time, which aligns with the problem description.
- The code handles the case where multiple buses arrive at the same time by choosing any of them, which is allowed by the problem description.
- The output hints also agree with the code in terms of the functionality described.

Therefore, based on the code logic and the given problem description, the code is correct and meets all the requirements specified.
