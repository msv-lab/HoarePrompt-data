According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `buses` list. If the list has at least 1 tuple `(s, d)`, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `n` remains a positive integer, `t` remains a positive integer, and `min_time` remains positive infinity. So for the loop to be executed, the list `buses` must have at least 1 tuple `(s, d)`, and `i` is the index of the last tuple in the list, `s` is the source value of the last tuple, and `d` is the destination value of the last tuple.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `min_time` is positive infinity, `ans` is -1, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 1 tuple, `i` is the index of the last tuple, `s` is the source value of the last tuple, `d` is the destination value of the last tuple**
