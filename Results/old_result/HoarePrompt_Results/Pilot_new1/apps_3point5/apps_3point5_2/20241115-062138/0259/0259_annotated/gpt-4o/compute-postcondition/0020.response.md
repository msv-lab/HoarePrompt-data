Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value 0. The values of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the route with the minimum waiting time, `n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are retained, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of bus_routes[i], and `wait_time` is 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the route with the minimum waiting time, `n`, `i`, `s_i`, and `d_i` are retained, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of bus_routes[i], and `wait_time` is 0**
