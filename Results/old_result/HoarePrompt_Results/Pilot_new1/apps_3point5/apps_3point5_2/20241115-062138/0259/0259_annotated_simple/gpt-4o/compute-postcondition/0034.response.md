Output State: `min_wait_time` is a non-negative integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the route chosen based on the minimum wait time, `i` is the next route index, `n` is a positive integer representing the total number of routes, `s_i` is assigned the value of `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is assigned the value of `bus_routes[i + 1]`, and `wait_time` is either the result of subtracting `t` from `s_i` if `s_i >= t`, 0 if `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, or calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i` if `(t - s_i) % d_i != 0`. After executing the code snippet, `min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`.
