According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `n` is greater than `i + 1`, and `wait_time` is equal to `min_wait_time`. 

To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `n` should be greater than `i + 2` to satisfy the condition for the loop to continue.
2. No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`min_wait_time` is a finite positive value, `n` is greater than `i + 2`, `wait_time` is equal to `min_wait_time`**
