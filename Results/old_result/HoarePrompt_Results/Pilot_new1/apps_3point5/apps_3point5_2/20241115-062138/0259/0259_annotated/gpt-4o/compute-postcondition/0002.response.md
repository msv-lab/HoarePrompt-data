According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity and `chosen_route` is -1. To ensure the loop executes, `n` needs to be greater than 0, and `i` should be 0 at the start of the loop.
State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
