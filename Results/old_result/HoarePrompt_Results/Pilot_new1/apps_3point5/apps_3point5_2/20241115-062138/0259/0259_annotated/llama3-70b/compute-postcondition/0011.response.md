According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer + 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer + 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer + 2, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list with at least two elements containing the previous elements and the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is an integer assigned the first integer from the input, `d` is an integer assigned the second integer from the input**
