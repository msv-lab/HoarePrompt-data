The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates with the preconditions that `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each element is between 1 and `n` inclusive. The function does not return any value directly, but it performs a specific operation or task based on the values of `n` and `a` that adhere to the given constraints.
