Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array. It then calculates the distances of these elements from the beginning and end of the array and determines the maximum possible distance by taking the maximum of all four possible distances. This logic ensures that the program correctly identifies the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after performing exactly one swap. The program covers all potential cases and works as expected for all given examples.
