Example Answer:
`dist4` is assigned the absolute difference between n - 1 and `min_pos`. The values of `n`, `min_pos`, and `dist4` are known. Therefore, after execution, `dist4` will be the absolute difference between n - 1 and `min_pos`. 
Output State: **`n` is an integer within the range 2 <= n <= 100, `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `min_pos` is the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is 99, `dist2` is the absolute difference between n - 1 and `max_pos`, `dist3` is an integer within the range 0 to n-1, `dist4` is the absolute difference between n - 1 and min_pos**
