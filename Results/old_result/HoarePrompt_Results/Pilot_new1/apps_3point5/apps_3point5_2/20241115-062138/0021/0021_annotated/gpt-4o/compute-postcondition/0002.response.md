Example Answer:
`min_pos` is assigned the index of the element 1 in list `a`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers between 1 and n inclusive, the index of element 1 in list `a` will be the minimum position of 1 in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each element is between 1 and n inclusive, `min_pos` is the index of element 1 in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each element is between 1 and n inclusive, `min_pos` is the index of element 1 in list `a`**
