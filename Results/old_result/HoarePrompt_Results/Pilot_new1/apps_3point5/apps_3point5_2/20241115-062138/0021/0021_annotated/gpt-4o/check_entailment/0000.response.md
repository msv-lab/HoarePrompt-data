Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The annotations mention that the code does not handle cases where the input values do not meet the specified constraints (2 <= n <= 100, elements in the list are between 1 and n inclusive). This means that if the input values fall outside of these constraints, the program may not produce the correct output. For example, if the input contains duplicate elements or elements outside the range of 1 to n, the program may not work as expected.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not cover all potential cases as required by the problem description.
