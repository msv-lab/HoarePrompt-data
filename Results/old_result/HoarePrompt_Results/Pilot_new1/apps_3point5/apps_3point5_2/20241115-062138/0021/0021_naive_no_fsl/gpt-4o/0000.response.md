Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and then calculating the distance from the ends of the array. It considers all possible cases for the minimum and maximum elements being at the beginning, end, or somewhere in between, and calculates the maximum distance accordingly. The logic is sound and covers all potential scenarios as described in the problem statement.
