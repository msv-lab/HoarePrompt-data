Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of n in list `a`, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and the index of n in list `a`, `dist2` is the absolute difference between n - 1 - max_pos, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos, `dist4` is the absolute difference between n - 1 - min_pos, and `max_distance` is the maximum value among dist1, dist2, dist3, dist4**
