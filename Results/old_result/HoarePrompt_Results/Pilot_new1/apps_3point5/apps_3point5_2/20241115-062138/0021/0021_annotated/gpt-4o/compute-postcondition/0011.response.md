Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input and a list of `n` distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the numbers 1 and `n` in the list, as well as their distances from the beginning and end of the list. The function prints the maximum distance calculated. The code does not handle cases where the input values do not meet the specified constraints (2 <= n <= 100, elements in list are between 1 and n inclusive).**
