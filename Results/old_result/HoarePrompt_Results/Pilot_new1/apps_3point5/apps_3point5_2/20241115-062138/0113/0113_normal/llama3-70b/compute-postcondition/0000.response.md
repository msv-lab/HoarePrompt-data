Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values based on the input split by space and converted to integers. The values of `n` and `k` are positive integers, so they will retain their respective values. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a non-negative integer**
