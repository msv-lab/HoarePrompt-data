Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is calculated by multiplying `n` by the result of `(multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. The value of `n` can range from 1 to 10^9, and the value of `multiplier` can be 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000. The `math.gcd()` function calculates the greatest common divisor of `n` and `multiplier`. Therefore, the value of `x` is dependent on the values of `n` and `multiplier`. 
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; multiplier is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000; x is the result of n multiplied by (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))**
