Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input and stores the digits on each cube.
2. It then creates a set of unique digits excluding '0' (as leading zeros are not allowed).
3. It sorts the digits in descending order and constructs the maximum number possible.
4. The program outputs the correct maximum number that Masha can make using her cubes.
5. The program handles all potential cases and abides by the problem description.
