According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 3 cube lists, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input splitting with at least two cubes, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the first cube and the string representations of the digits in the next cube in the cubes list are added to `digits`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the cubes list must have at least 3 cube lists.
State: **`n` is an input integer between 1 and 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained from input splitting with at least three cubes, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in the first cube and the string representations of the digits in the next cube in the cubes list are added to `digits`**
