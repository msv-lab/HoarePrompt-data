According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are digits in the list `digits`. Since `digits` is a list containing individual digits of the number `num`, if `num` is a positive integer, there will be at least one digit in the list. Therefore, the loop can execute. 

Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted such that `num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, each containing 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the cubes, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of the number `num`, and `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to False.

State: **`num` is a positive integer, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, `cube_faces` is a list of `n` lists, each containing 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the cubes, `digits` is a list containing individual digits of the number `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized to False**
