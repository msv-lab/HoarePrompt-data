Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads the input to create a set of digits from a collection of cubes, ensuring that each digit is unique.
- It then removes '0' from the set, as leading zeros are not allowed in the constructed number.
- It finds the maximum number that can be formed by concatenating the digits in descending order.
- Finally, it prints this maximum number.
- The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases, as it handles the constraints and requirements specified.
