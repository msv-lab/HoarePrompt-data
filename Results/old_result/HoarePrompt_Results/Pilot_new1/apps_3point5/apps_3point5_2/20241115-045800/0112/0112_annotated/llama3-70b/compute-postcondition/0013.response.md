Postcondition: ***If `cubes` is a list with at least one sublist, the loop updates the set `digits` with string representations of the digits in each sublist. If `cubes` is empty, `digits` remains an empty set. After the execution of the if statement, if '0' is not in `digits`, then '0' is removed from `digits`.***
