The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`. The function involves a loop that iterates over the digits in `num` and checks if a certain condition is met based on the values of `used_cubes`, `digit`, and `cube_faces`. If the condition is met for any digit, the corresponding element in `used_cubes` is set to True, and the loop is terminated with `found` being True. If no such condition is met for any digit, `found` remains False. After the loop, if `found` is False, the function returns False. If the loop does not execute at all, the function returns True. Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to iterate over the digits in `num` and update `used_cubes` based on certain conditions, returning True if the conditions are met for any digit, and False otherwise.
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter num and iterates over its digits to update used_cubes based on certain conditions. It returns True if the conditions are met for any digit, and False otherwise.**
