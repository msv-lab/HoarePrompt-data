The function `func_1` accepts an integer `n` and a list of `n` lists containing integers representing cube faces. It iterates through the values of `x` starting from 0 until the function `can_form_number(x+1)` returns false. The function then returns the largest integer `x` for which `can_form_number` returns true. The code does not provide the implementation of the `can_form_number` function, which could impact the accuracy of the result.
