According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list. If there is at least one more digit left in the list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False and the `digits` list has at least one more digit left. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `digits` list must have at least two digits remaining.
State: **`found` is False, `digits` list has at least two digits left**
