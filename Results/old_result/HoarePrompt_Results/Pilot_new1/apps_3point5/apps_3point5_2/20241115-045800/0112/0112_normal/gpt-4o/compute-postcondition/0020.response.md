According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than the previous value of n. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:

State: **`n` is an integer representing the number of cubes Masha has, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube, `digits` is a list of the digits of the positive integer `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of n booleans with the boolean at index i set to True if i is equal to the index of the cube where the digit is found, `found` is True if the digit is found on a cube face and False otherwise, `n` is greater than the previous value of n.**
