Output State: 
If `digits` is not empty and there exists at least one index `i` such that `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then after the loop executes, `used_cubes` will have the `i-th` element set to True, `found` will be True, and the loop will be terminated with `i` being the index where the condition was met. If no such index exists or `digits` is empty, the loop will not execute, `found` will remain False, and all variables will remain unchanged. After the loop, if `found` is False, the program will return False. In the case where the loop does not execute, `found` will remain False, and all variables will remain unchanged. 
**found is False, digits list has at least one more digit left, used_cubes may have been updated if conditions were met.**
