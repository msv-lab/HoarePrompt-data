According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `digits` and `found`. If `found` is False, the loop will not execute again. At the end of the previous iteration, `num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `found` are in the same state as the initial state. So for the loop to execute one more time, `found` needs to be True. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`num`, `n`, `cube_faces`, `digits`, `used_cubes`, `found` are in the same state as the initial state, `found` is True**
