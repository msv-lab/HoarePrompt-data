Correctness: False

The provided program does not handle the restriction that Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. The program simply considers all digits on the cubes without taking into account this restriction. Therefore, the program may output a number that is not achievable by rotating the cubes according to the given rules. 

For example, consider the following input:
3
0 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7

The correct output should be 87, as Masha can build all numbers from 1 to 87. However, the program may output a larger number by considering the 9 on the second cube as a 6, leading to an incorrect result.
