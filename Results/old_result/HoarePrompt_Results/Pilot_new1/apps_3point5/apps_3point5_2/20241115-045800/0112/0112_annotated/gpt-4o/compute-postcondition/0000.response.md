The variable `digits` is assigned the list of characters obtained by converting the integer `num` to a string and then converting that string to a list. The value of `num` is not provided, so the output state is: `digits` is a list containing the digits of the unknown number `num`.
Output State: **`digits` is a list containing the digits of the unknown number `num`**
