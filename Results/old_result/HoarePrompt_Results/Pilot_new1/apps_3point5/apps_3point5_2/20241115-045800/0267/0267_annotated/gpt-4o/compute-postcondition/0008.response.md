According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `l` and `r`. If `num` is within the range `[l, r]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The postcondition covers all cases where `num + 1` is less than or equal to `r`, ensuring that the final value of `total_sum` adheres to the constraints and updates based on the current state and function evaluation. 

So, for the loop to be executed one more time, the `num` needs to be incremented by 1, and if `func_1(num + 1, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` should be updated to `(total_sum + num + 1) % MOD`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_sum` is an integer, if `func_1(num + 1, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num + 1) % MOD**
