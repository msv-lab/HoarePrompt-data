Output State: **If k is greater than 1, the loop will execute and update the value of dp[n, k]. The loop calculates a specific formula and updates dp[n, k] accordingly for each iteration. After the loop executes, dp[n, k] will be updated based on the formula. If k is 1 or less, the loop will not execute and dp[n, k] will remain 9.**
