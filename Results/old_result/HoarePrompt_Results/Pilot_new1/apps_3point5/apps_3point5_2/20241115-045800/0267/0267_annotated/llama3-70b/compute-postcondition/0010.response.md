According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, n is a non-negative integer and k is a positive integer. The value of i will start from 1 and go up to k-1. Therefore, for the loop to execute, n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, and i is 1.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values with dp[n, k] = 9, i is 1**
