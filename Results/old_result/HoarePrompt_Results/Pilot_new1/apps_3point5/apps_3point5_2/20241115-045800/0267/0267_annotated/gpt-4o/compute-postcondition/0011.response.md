According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range of values `l` and `r` and the evaluation of `func_1(num, k)`. If the loop is to execute one more time, `num` should be within the range of `l` to `r` inclusive and the condition `func_1(num, k)` should evaluate to true. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is an integer. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the `num` should be the next number in the range of `l` to `r` inclusive that satisfies the condition `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true. 
State: **`total_sum` is an integer, `num` is the next number in the range of `l` to `r` inclusive that satisfies `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true**
