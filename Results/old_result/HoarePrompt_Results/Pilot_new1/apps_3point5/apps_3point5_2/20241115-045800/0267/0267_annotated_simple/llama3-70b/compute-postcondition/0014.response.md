According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, and the updated value of `dp[n, k]` is the result of the expression `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10`. Since `i` is 2 and the loop starts from 1, the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 3, the updated value of `dp[n, k]` is the result of the expression `dp[n, k] += 9 * 10**
