Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly defines the MOD value as 998244353.
2. The function func_1(n, k) correctly checks if the number n contains at most k different digits by converting the number to a string, converting it to a set to get unique digits, and checking if the length of the set is less than or equal to k.
3. The function func_2(l, r, k) correctly calculates the sum of numbers from l to r that satisfy the condition of containing at most k different digits by iterating through each number in the range, checking if it satisfies the condition using func_1, and updating the total sum accordingly.
4. The program correctly reads the input values for l, r, and k, calls func_2 with the input values, and prints the result.

Overall, the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and correctly calculates the sum of numbers from l to r that contain at most k different digits.
