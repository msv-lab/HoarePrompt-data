The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n` (a non-negative integer), `k` (a positive integer), and `dp` (a dictionary to store previously computed values). 

Case 1: If `k` equals 0, the function returns 0. There are no changes to `n`, `k`, or `dp`, and the program simply returns 0 as the output.

Case 2: If the key (n, k) is already present in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the corresponding value stored in `dp`. Otherwise, there are no changes to `n`, `k`, or `dp`, and the program simply returns 0 as the output.

Case 3: The function returns the value stored in `dp[n, k]` after executing the provided formula. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count` is to accept three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`, and return the appropriate value based on the conditions described in the cases.
