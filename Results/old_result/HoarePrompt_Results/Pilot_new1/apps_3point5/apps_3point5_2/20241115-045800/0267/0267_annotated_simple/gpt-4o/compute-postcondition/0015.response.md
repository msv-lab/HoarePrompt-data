Functionality: **The function func_2 accepts three integers l, r, and k. It iterates through the range [l, r] and calculates the sum of numbers for which func_1(num, k) returns true. The total sum is then taken modulo MOD. If l is greater than r, the total sum remains 0.** 

Potential edge cases and missing functionality:
- The annotations mention a function func_1 being called, but its implementation and behavior are not provided in the code. Therefore, the actual behavior of func_2 is dependent on func_1, which is not defined in the given context.
- It is assumed that MOD is defined somewhere in the code or globally, as its usage is not explicitly shown in the provided snippet.
