According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, `k` is a positive integer. Since `i` needs to be less than `k` for the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to 2.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values with dp[n, k] = value, i is 2**
