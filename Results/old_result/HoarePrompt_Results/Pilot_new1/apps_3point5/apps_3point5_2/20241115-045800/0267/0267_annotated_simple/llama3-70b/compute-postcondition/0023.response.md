Functionality: ** The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary to store previously calculated values. The function returns different values based on the conditions mentioned in the cases provided in the annotations. If `k` equals 0, the function returns 0. If the key (n, k) is present in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value stored in dp[n, k]. If `n` is less than 10, the function returns dp[n, k]. The function calculates and stores values in the dp dictionary based on the provided logic.**
