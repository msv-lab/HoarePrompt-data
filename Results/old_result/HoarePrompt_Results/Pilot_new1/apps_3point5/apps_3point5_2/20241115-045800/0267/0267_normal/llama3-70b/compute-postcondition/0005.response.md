Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store previously computed values. If (n, k) is already a key in dp, the program returns the corresponding value stored in dp. Otherwise, there are no changes to n, k, or dp, and the program simply returns 0 as the output.***
