Example Answer:
`dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the calculation `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `i` are given as non-negative integer, positive integer, and 1 respectively. After the calculation, the new value of `dp[n, k]` will be the result of the expression. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, and the updated value of `dp[n, k]`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 1, and the updated value of `dp[n, k] is the result of the expression`**
