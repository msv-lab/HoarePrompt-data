According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is a positive integer. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `i` is 2, and the updated value of `dp[n, k] is the result of the expression**
