Example Answer:
`dp[n, k]` is assigned the value `n`. The output state is: n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store previously calculated values. If (n, k) is present in dp, the function returns the value stored in dp[n, k]. n is less than 10 raised to the power of k, and now dp contains the key-value pair (n, k): n.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store previously calculated values containing the key-value pair (n, k): n**
