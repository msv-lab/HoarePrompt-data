The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. It iterates over the range from `l` to `r`, inclusive, and for each number in that range, it calls `func_1(num, k)`. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, it updates the `total_sum` by adding the number `num` and taking the modulus with MOD. The function then returns the final value of `total_sum`. Therefore, the functionality of the function is to accept three integers `l`, `r`, and `k`, iterate over the range from `l` to `r`, update `total_sum` based on the conditions, and return the final value of `total_sum`.
