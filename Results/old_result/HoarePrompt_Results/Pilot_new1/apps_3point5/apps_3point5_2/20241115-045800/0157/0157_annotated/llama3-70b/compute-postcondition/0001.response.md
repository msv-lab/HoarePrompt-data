Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since `a` is already assigned an input integer value within the range of 1 to 1000, the output state is: `a` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 1000, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer within the range of 1 to 1000, `b` is an input integer**
