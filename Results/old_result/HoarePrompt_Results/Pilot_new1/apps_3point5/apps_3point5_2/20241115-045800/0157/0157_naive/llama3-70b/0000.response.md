Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears from which Nikolay can cook the compote by finding the minimum of the number of lemons, half the number of apples, and one-fourth of the number of pears. It then calculates the total number of fruits based on this minimum value. The logic aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, ensuring the correctness of the program.
