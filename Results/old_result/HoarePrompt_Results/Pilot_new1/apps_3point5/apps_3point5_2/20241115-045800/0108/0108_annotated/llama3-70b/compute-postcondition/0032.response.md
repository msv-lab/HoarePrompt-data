Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the string `res` using the `+=` operator. The updated `res` will contain all the characters from the original `res` string plus the character `char`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` will have the next character in the alphabet after the current first character, `res` will contain the characters in the updated `s` incremented by one alphabet letter each time, `char` will be the next character in the alphabet after the updated last character in `s`, and `alphabet` contains the next character in the alphabet after the updated last character in `s`.
Output State: **`s` will have the next character in the alphabet after the current first character, `res` will contain the characters in the updated `s` incremented by one alphabet letter each time, `char` will be the next character in the alphabet after the updated last character in `s`, and `alphabet` contains the next character in the alphabet after the updated last character in `s`**
