Example Answer: 
If 's' contains the character 'b' at least once, the code replaces the first occurrence of 'char' (which is the next character in the alphabet after 'b') with the character after 'char'. Therefore, if 's' contains 'b', the output state will be: 's' contains the character 'b' at least once, 'res' will contain a string of 'a's followed by the character after 'b', and 'char' is the next character in the alphabet after 'b'.
Output State: **'s' contains the character 'b' at least once, 'res' will contain a string of 'a's followed by the character after 'b', and 'char' is the next character in the alphabet after 'b'**
