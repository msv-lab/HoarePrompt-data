Example Answer:
If 's' contains the character 'b' at least once, 'res' will contain a string of 'a's followed by 'b', and 'char' is the next character in the alphabet after 'b'. The code appends the value of 'char' to 'res'. Therefore, the Output State is: If 's' contains the character 'b' at least once, 'res' will contain a string of 'a's followed by 'b', and 'char' is the next character in the alphabet after 'b'.
Output State: **If 's' contains the character 'b' at least once, 'res' will contain a string of 'a's followed by 'b', and 'char' is the next character in the alphabet after 'b'**
