Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. Since `char` is equal to the first character in the alphabet, the first character in the string `s` will be replaced with the next character in the alphabet. The length of the string remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a modified string with the first character replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` is a string containing the first character in the alphabet.
Output State: **`s` is a modified string with the first character replaced by the next character in the alphabet, `res` is a string containing the first character in the alphabet**
