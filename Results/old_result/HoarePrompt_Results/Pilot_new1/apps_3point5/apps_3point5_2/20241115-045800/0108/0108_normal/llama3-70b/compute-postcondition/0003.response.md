According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the alphabet. Therefore, the loop will execute 26 times. Before the loop starts, `s` being a string consisting of small English letters does not affect the loop execution. `res` being an empty string also does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `s` is a string consisting of |s| (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5) small English letters, `res` is an empty string, and `char` is the first character in the alphabet.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of |s| (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5) small English letters, `res` is an empty string, `char` is the first character in the alphabet**
