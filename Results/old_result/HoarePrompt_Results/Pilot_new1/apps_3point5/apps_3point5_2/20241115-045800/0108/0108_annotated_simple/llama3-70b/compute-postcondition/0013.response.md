Output State: **If `s` contains the character `char` at least once, `s` will have the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character next to it in the alphabet. `alphabet` will remain unchanged. `res` will contain the first character in the `alphabet` string followed by the number of occurrences of `char` in the loop. If `char` is not in `s`, the loop will not execute and `res` will be the first character in the `alphabet` string, `s` will remain unchanged.**
