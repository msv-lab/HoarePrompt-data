According to the code, the loop can execute if both `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is incremented by 4 and `j` is either 0 or 1 depending on the comparison of characters at index `i` in `s` and index `j` in `target`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted so that it is still less than the length of `s`, and `j` needs to be adjusted based on the comparison of characters at index `i` in `s` and index `j` in `target`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target_len` is the length of `target`, `i` is incremented by 4, `j` is adjusted based on the comparison of characters at index `i` in `s` and index `j` in `target`**
