Postcondition: ***If `s` is an empty string, the loop does not execute and the values of `res`, `char`, and `alphabet` remain unchanged. If `s` contains at least one character, after the loop finishes, `res` will contain the characters in `s` incremented by one alphabet letter each time. `s` will be an empty string, `char` will be the next character in the alphabet after the last character in `s`, and `alphabet` contains the next character in the alphabet after the last character in `s`. If the length of `res` is 26, the function prints `res`, otherwise it prints -1.***
