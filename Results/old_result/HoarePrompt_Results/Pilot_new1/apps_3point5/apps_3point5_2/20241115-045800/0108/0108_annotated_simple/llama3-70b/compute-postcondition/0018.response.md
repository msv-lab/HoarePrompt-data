Example Answer: 
The character `char` is added to the end of the `res` string. The `res` string now includes the character `char`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character next to it in the alphabet, `alphabet` remains unchanged, `res` contains the first character in the `alphabet` string followed by the updated number of occurrences of `char` in the loop, `res` is updated to include the character `char`.
Output State: **`s` has the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the character next to it in the alphabet, `alphabet` remains unchanged, `res` contains the first character in the `alphabet` string followed by the updated number of occurrences of `char` in the loop, `res` is updated to include the character `char`**
