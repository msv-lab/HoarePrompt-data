According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `s[i]` matches `target[j]`, `j` is incremented by 1. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the conditions `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len` must still hold. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to the state.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1, and if `s[i]` matches `target[j]`, `j` is incremented by 1**
