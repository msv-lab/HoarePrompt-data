Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes the input string and iterates through the English alphabet. For each character in the alphabet, it replaces occurrences of that character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet. If all 26 characters of the alphabet are found in the input string, it prints the resulting string, which will have the English alphabet as a subsequence. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases where the input string can be transformed to contain the English alphabet as a subsequence.
