According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in the `alphabet` string. Since `alphabet` contains all lowercase English alphabets, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `s` being a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 does not affect the loop execution. At the start of the loop, `res` is an empty string. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `char` should be set to the first character in the `alphabet` string.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `alphabet` is a string containing all the lowercase English alphabets, `res` is an empty string, `char` is the first character in the `alphabet` string**
