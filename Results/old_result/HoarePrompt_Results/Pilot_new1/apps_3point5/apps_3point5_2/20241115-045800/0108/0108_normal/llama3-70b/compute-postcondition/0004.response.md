Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`, where `char` is the first character in the alphabet. Since `res` was initially empty and `char` is the first character 'a', after execution, `res` will contain the character 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of |s| (1 ≤ |s| ≤ 10^5) small English letters, `res` is a string containing the character 'a', `char` is the first character in the alphabet**
