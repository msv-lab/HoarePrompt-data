Functionality: The function reads an input string `s` and iterates through it while comparing each character to the corresponding character in the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If all characters in `s` match the characters in the target string, it prints the target string. If there is a mismatch at any point, it prints -1. The function does not explicitly return any value. It handles cases where the target string is empty, where all characters in `s` match the target, and where there is a mismatch between the characters in `s` and the target.
