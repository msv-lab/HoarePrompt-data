Correctness: **True**

The program iterates over the English alphabet and checks if each character is present in the input string `s`. If a character is found, it is appended to the result string `res` and replaced in the input string `s` with the next character in the alphabet. After the loop, if the length of the result string `res` is 26 (indicating that all characters from the alphabet are present), it prints the result. Otherwise, it prints -1.

The program covers all possible cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly handles the scenario where the input string contains characters that can be replaced to form the English alphabet as a subsequence. It also correctly handles the case where it is impossible to form the English alphabet as a subsequence. Therefore, the program is correct.
