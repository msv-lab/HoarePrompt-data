According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`. To execute the loop one more time, both `i` and `j` need to be incremented by 1.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive), `i` is less than the length of `s` and `i` is incremented by 1, `j` is less than `target_len` and `j` is incremented by 1**
