According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the alphabet. At the end of the previous iteration, 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, then 'res' contains a string of 'a's followed by 'b', 'char' is the first character in the alphabet. So for the loop to execute one more time, 's' needs to contain the character 'a' at least once, 'res' will contain a string of 'a's followed by 'b', and 'char' needs to be the next character in the alphabet after the current 'char'.
State: **If 's' contains the character 'a' at least once, then 'res' will contain a string of 'a's followed by 'b', 'char' is the next character in the alphabet after the current 'char'**
