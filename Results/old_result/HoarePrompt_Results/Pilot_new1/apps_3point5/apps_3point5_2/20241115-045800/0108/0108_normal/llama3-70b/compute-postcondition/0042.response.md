Postcondition: ***If 's' contains all the characters in the alphabet, 'res' contains the alphabet in order, 'char' is the next character in the alphabet after the last character in 's', and the contents of 'res' are printed. If 's' does not contain all the characters, 'res' contains the characters present in 's' in their original order, 'char' will be the next character in the alphabet after the last character in 's'. If 's' is empty or does not contain any characters from the alphabet, 'res' remains empty, and 'char' is the first character in the alphabet. If the length of 'res' is 26, the contents of 'res' are printed. Otherwise, -1 is printed.***
