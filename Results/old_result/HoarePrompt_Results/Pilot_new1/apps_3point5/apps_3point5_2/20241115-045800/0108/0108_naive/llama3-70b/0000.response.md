Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes a string input and iterates through the alphabet, replacing each character with the next character in alphabetical order until the entire alphabet is formed as a subsequence in the given string. If the length of the resulting string is 26 (the length of the alphabet), it prints the resulting string. Otherwise, it prints -1. The logic of the program seems correct as it follows the problem description accurately and should work for all potential cases.
