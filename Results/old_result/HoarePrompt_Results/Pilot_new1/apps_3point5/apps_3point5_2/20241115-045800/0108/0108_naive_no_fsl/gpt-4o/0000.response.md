Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly iterates through the input string `s` and the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' to check if the characters match. If all characters in the target string are found in the input string in order, it prints the target string, otherwise it prints -1. The logic follows the problem description accurately and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
