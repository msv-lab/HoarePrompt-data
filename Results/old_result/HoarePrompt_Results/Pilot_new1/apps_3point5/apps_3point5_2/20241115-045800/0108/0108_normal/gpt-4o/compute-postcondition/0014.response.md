Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is incremented by 1. If `s[i]` matches `target[j]`, `j` is incremented by 1. The increment of `j` is subject to the conditions that `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than `target_len`.***
