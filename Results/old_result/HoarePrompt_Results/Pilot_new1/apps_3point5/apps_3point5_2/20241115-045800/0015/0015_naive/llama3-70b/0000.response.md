Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If c is 0, then the only way for b to appear in the sequence is if a equals b, which is correctly handled in the code.
2. If c is not 0, then the code checks if the difference between b and a is a multiple of c and if the result is greater than or equal to 0. This correctly determines if b appears in the sequence or not based on the given conditions.
