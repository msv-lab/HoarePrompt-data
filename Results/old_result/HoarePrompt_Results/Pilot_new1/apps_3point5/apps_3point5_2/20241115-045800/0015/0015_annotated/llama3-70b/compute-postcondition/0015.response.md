Functionality: **The function reads three integers from the input, assigns them to variables a, b, and c. If c is 0, it prints 'YES' if a is equal to b, otherwise 'NO' is printed. If c is not 0, it prints 'YES' if the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, and 'NO' otherwise. The function covers cases where the division of (b - a) by c results in an integer and the result is non-negative. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
