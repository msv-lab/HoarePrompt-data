Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are input integers. `b` is not equal to `a`. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0 and the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is satisfied, the program prints 'YES'. If the condition is not met, the program prints 'NO'. The program covers all scenarios where `b` and `a` are distinct, `c` is not 0, and the division of `b` minus `a` by `c` results in a non-negative integer or the remainder of the division is 0.***
