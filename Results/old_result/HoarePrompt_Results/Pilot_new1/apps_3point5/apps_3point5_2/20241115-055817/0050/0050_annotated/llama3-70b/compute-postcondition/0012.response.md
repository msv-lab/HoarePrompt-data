Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, `i` are as described. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is updated by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the loop breaks. All variables maintain their initial conditions and ranges.***
