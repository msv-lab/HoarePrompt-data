Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` are as described above, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, then `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
