According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers within specified ranges, `b` is a list containing mapped input values sorted in reverse order, `i` is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
- No other states need to be adjusted as the loop will continue based on the value of `i` and `n`.

State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers within specified ranges, `b` is a list containing mapped input values sorted in reverse order, `i` is incremented by 1**
