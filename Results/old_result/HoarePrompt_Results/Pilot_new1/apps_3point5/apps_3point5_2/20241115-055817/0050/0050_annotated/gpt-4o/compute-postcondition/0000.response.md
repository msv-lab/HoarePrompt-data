Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values obtained by splitting the input. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30 inclusive. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30 inclusive.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are integers between 1 and 30 inclusive**
