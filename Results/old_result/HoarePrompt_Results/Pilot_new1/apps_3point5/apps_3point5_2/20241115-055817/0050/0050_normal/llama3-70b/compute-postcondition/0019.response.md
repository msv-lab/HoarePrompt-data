Example Answer:
The value of `shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`. The variables `n`, `m`, and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` where `r` is an integer, `s[i]` is a positive integer, and `shares` is updated.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` where `r` is an integer, `s[i]` is a positive integer, and `shares` is updated**
