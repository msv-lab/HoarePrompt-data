According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `m` is greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` are as described above, `i` is 1, `m` is greater than 0**
