According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `shares` is 0. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the states need to be adjusted such that `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `b` is a list containing the mapped input values sorted in reverse order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0**
