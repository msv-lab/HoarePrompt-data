According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, `i+1`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, the loop will execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, the variables are as described. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `r` needs to be greater than or equal to `s[i+1]` to continue the loop. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, `i+1` are as described**
