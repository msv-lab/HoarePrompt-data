Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r` are integers, `s[i]` is a positive integer. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is modified to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, then `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` remain unchanged, and the execution breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
