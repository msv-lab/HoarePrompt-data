Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares` where `r` is an integer and `s[i]` is a positive integer. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `shares` is updated to include the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. Otherwise, the program exits the loop without changing the values of `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`.***
