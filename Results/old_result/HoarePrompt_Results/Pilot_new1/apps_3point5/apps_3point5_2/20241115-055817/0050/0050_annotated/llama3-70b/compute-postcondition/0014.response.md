Example Answer:
The value of `shares` is incremented by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]`. The previous values of `shares`, `r`, and `s[i]` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, `i+1` are as described, and `shares` is incremented by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r`, `s`, `b`, `shares`, `i+1` are as described, and `shares` is incremented by the floor division of `r` by `s[i]`**
