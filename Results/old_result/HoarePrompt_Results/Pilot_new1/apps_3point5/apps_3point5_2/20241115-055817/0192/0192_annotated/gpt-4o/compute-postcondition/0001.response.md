Example Answer:
The expression calculates `(x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2`. Given that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the result will always be half of the difference between x and y, plus 1 if the difference is odd. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
