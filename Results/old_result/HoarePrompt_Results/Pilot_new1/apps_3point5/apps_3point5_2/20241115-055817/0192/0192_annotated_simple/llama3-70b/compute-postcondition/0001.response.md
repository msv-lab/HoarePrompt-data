Example Answer:
The absolute difference between x and y is calculated using the abs() function and then printed. Since x and y are integers satisfying the condition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the output will always be a positive integer representing the difference between x and y.
Output State: **The absolute difference between x and y is printed as an integer**
