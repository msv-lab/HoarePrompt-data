Example Answer:
The code calculates (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2. Since x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000, the result will always be an integer. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers such that 3 <= y < x <= 100,000**
