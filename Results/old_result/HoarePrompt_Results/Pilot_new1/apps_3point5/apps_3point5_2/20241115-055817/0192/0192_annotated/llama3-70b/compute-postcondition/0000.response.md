Example Answer: 
`x` and `y` are assigned the values from the input after splitting. Since the input is expected to be two integers separated by a space, the values of `x` and `y` are updated accordingly. The values of `x` and `y` are integers that satisfy the precondition 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. 
Output State: **`x` and `y` are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
