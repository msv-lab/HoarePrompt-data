The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates on the preconditions that x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. The function does not return any value, as the output or behavior of the function is not specified. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to perform some operation or task based on the preconditions provided, without returning any specific value.
