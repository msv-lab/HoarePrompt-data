Example Answer:
`p_shared` is calculated using the formula `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`. The values of `p_total` and `p_no_shared` are already assigned based on the initial state. Therefore, `p_shared` is calculated based on those values. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`numerator` is updated based on the formula `numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, `denominator` is updated to `denominator * total_days % MOD`, `i` is the number of iterations completed, `k` is greater than or equal to the number of iterations completed, `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the formula `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`**
