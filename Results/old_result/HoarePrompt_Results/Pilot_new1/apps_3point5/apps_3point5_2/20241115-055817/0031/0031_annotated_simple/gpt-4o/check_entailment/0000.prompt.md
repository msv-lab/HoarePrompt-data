You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says.  If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
We have added some annotations within the code to help you understand the code and its logic. The annotations are in the form of comments and are inserted automatically so double check whether the annotations are correct or not and describe the code correctly.
If the annotations are correct use them along with the code to determine the correctness of the code. If the annotations are incorrect then you can ignore them and just use the code to determine the correctness.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: ZS the Coder has recently found an interesting concept called the Birthday Paradox. It states that given a random set of 23 people, there is around 50% chance that some two of them share the same birthday. ZS the Coder finds this very interesting, and decides to test this with the inhabitants of Udayland.

In Udayland, there are 2^{n} days in a year. ZS the Coder wants to interview k people from Udayland, each of them has birthday in one of 2^{n} days (each day with equal probability). He is interested in the probability of at least two of them have the birthday at the same day. 

ZS the Coder knows that the answer can be written as an irreducible fraction $\frac{A}{B}$. He wants to find the values of A and B (he does not like to deal with floating point numbers). Can you help him?


-----Input-----

The first and only line of the input contains two integers n and k (1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18), meaning that there are 2^{n} days in a year and that ZS the Coder wants to interview exactly k people.


-----Output-----

If the probability of at least two k people having the same birthday in 2^{n} days long year equals $\frac{A}{B}$ (A ≥ 0, B ≥ 1, $\operatorname{gcd}(A, B) = 1$), print the A and B in a single line.

Since these numbers may be too large, print them modulo 10^6 + 3. Note that A and B must be coprime before their remainders modulo 10^6 + 3 are taken.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 2

Output
1 8
Input
1 3

Output
1 1
Input
4 3

Output
23 128


-----Note-----

In the first sample case, there are 2^3 = 8 days in Udayland. The probability that 2 people have the same birthday among 2 people is clearly $\frac{1}{8}$, so A = 1, B = 8.

In the second sample case, there are only 2^1 = 2 days in Udayland, but there are 3 people, so it is guaranteed that two of them have the same birthday. Thus, the probability is 1 and A = B = 1.
Annotated Program:
```
#Function 1:
def func_1(a, b):
    while b:
        a, b = b, a % b
        
    #State of the program after the loop has been executed: If b is not 0, a holds the original value of b, b holds the remainder of the division of the original a by the original b. If b is 0, a holds the greatest common divisor of the original a and b, b is 0.
    return a
    #The program returns the greatest common divisor of the original a and b

#Function 2:
def func_2(n, k):
    MOD = 10 ** 6 + 3
    if (k > 1 << n) :
        print(1, 1)
        return
        #The program returns the value of k shifted left by n, which is an integer greater than 1
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *MOD is 1000003. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, the program prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the program variables.
    total_days = 1 << n
    numerator = 1
    denominator = 1
    for i in range(k):
        numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD
        
        denominator = denominator * total_days % MOD
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If k is greater than 0, the loop calculates the numerator and denominator based on the given formulas. After the loop executes, MOD remains 1000003, total_days remains 1 shifted left by n, numerator is updated based on the calculation `numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, denominator is the new calculated value, i is the final value of the loop variable, k is greater than 0. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and numerator and denominator remain 1.
    p_no_shared = numerator
    p_total = denominator
    p_shared = (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD
    A = p_shared
    B = p_total
    g = func_1(A, B)
    A //= g
    B //= g
    print(A % MOD, B % MOD)

If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect. Then if even for one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False** .You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the descriptions says. But if you cant find an example where the program does not work as expected in the description and all the examples you think work correctly then the program is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. If you cant find a single case then the program is correct.
