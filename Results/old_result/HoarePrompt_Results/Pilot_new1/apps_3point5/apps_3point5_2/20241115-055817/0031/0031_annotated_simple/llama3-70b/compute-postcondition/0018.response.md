The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraints that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. After executing the function body, the program returns the remainder of the numerator `n` divided by `k`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and return the remainder of the division of `n` by `k`.
