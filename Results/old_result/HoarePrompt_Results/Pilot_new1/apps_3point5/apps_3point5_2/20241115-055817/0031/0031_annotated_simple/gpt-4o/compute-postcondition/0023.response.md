A is assigned the value of p_shared, but the initial value of p_shared is unknown. B is assigned the value of p_total, but the initial value of p_total is also unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: A is assigned the value of p_shared; B is assigned the value of p_total.
Output State: **A is assigned the value of p_shared; B is assigned the value of p_total**
