Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It calculates the numerator and denominator as described in the problem statement and then reduces them to their irreducible form by finding the greatest common divisor. The program also correctly returns the remainders of the numerator and denominator after division by 1000003.

The code annotations provide a clear explanation of what the program does and highlights an edge case where the loop does not execute if k is 0 or negative. However, this edge case is handled correctly in the code by ensuring that the loop only executes if k is greater than 0. Since the program follows the problem description for all potential cases and the provided examples, we can conclude that the correctness of the program is **True**.
