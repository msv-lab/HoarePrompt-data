According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0 and `k` is greater than 0. This means the loop can execute one more time. Therefore, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` which should be incremented by 1.
State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 shifted left by n, numerator is updated based on the calculation, denominator is updated based on the calculation, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
