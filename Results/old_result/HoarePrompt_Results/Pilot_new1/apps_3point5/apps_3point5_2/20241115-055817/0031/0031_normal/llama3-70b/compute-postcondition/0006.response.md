According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is equal to the previous value multiplied by (`total_days` - `i`), `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`total_days` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is equal to the previous value multiplied by (`total_days` - `i`), `denominator` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
