The function `func_2` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`, both of which are integers satisfying the constraints 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The variable MOD is assigned the value 1000003. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, the program prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_2 is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, assign a value to MOD, and if a specific condition is met, print 1, 1 and return. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.
