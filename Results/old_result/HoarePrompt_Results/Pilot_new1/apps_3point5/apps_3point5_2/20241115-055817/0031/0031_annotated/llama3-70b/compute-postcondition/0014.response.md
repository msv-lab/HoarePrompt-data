Output State: **If k is greater than 0, after the loop executes, `numerator` will be the product of all values from `total_days - k + 1` to `total_days`, `denominator` will be `total_days` to the power of `k`. If k is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and `numerator` will remain 1, `denominator` will remain 1. `gcd` is the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.**
