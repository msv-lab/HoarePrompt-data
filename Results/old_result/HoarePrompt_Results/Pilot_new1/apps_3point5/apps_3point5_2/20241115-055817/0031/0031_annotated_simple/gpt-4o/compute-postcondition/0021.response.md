Example Answer: 
If k is greater than 0, p_no_shared is updated based on the calculation `numerator = numerator * (total_days - i) % MOD`, otherwise p_no_shared remains 1. `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. Then, `p_shared` is calculated as `(p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: p_no_shared is updated based on the condition; p_total is assigned the value of denominator; p_shared is calculated based on the formula.
Output State: **p_no_shared is updated based on the condition; p_total is assigned the value of denominator; p_shared is calculated based on the formula**
