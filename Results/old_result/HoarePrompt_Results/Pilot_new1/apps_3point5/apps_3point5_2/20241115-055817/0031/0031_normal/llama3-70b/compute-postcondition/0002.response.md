Example Answer: 
`denominator` is assigned the value 1. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `total_days` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1.
Output State: **`total_days` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1**
