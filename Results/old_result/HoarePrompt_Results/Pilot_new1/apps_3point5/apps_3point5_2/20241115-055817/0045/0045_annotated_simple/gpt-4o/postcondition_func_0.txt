The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. If the sum of integers from 1 to `k` (denoted as `min_sum`) is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, the function calculates a sequence based on the values of `n`, `k`, and `min_sum`, and returns this sequence. The program accounts for the edge case where `k` is less than 0, ensuring that the loop does not execute in this scenario.
