Output State: **`d` is assigned the value of `n // min_sum`, `remainder` is assigned the value of `n - d * min_sum - 3`, `sequence` is a list containing the values of `d * (i + 1) + 1` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, where the value at index `i` is incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 3`, `k` is greater than 0.**
