The function func_1 accepts two positive integers a and b, and calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of the initial values of a and b using the Euclidean algorithm. If b is non-zero, it iteratively updates a and b until b becomes 0, at which point a holds the GCD. If b is initially 0, the function returns a.
