According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is within the range specified in the for loop statement. At the end of the last iteration, the following states are given: If `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `k` is at least 1. If `remainder` becomes 0, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `k` should be at least 2 for the loop to execute again.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **If `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is decremented by 1, `k` is at least 2. If `remainder` becomes 0, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.**
