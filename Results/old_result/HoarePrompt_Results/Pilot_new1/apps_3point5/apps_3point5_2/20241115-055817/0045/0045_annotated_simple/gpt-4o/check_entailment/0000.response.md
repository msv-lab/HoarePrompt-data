Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by generating a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers with a sum equal to `n` and maximizing the greatest common divisor. It handles the case where there is no possible sequence by returning -1. The logic of calculating the sequence based on the input values is correct and the program covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
