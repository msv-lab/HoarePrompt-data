Output State: **If `min_sum` is not greater than `n`, `d` is the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, `remainder` is calculated based on the values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum`, and `k` is at least 1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, then the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.**
