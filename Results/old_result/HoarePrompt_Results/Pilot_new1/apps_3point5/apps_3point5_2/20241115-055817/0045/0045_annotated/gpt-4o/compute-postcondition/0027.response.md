Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k` within the range 1 ≤ `n`, `k` ≤ 10^10. It calculates `min_sum` as `k * (k + 1) // 2`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it computes a list 'sequence' containing the values of `d * (i + 1) + x` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, where the value at index `i` is incremented by `x`. If `k` is 0 or `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1.**
