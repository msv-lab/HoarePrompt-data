Example Answer:
`d` is assigned the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, and `remainder` is assigned the value of `n` minus `d` multiplied by `min_sum`. The output state depends on the initial values of `min_sum`, `n`, and `d`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1, otherwise `d` is calculated. The value of `remainder` is calculated based on the values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum`.
Output State: **Depends on the initial values of `min_sum`, `n`, and `d`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, `d` is assigned the floor division of `n` by `min_sum`, and `remainder` is calculated based on the values of `n`, `d`, and `min_sum`.**
