According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the condition `b` is true. At the end of the last iteration, `b` is 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to a value that evaluates to true in a boolean context. Therefore, `b` should be adjusted to a non-zero value or a boolean true value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is true, `b` is a non-zero value or a boolean true value**
