Correctness: False

The provided code is a function to calculate the greatest common divisor of two positive integers. While this function is useful for the problem at hand, it does not fully solve the problem described in the problem description. The function needs to be integrated into a larger program that generates a strictly increasing sequence of positive numbers whose sum is equal to n and whose greatest common divisor is maximal. Since this integration is missing in the provided code, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case.

An example where the program does not work correctly:
Input:
5 3

Expected Output:
-1

Explanation:
For the input n=5 and k=3, there is no possible sequence of strictly increasing positive numbers whose sum is equal to 5 and whose greatest common divisor is maximal. The expected output is -1, but the provided code does not handle this case.
