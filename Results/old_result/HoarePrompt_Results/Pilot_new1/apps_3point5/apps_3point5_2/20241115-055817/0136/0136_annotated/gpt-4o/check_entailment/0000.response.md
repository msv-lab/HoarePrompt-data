Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two non-negative integers as strings, removes any leading zeros, compares them, and prints the appropriate symbol ('<', '>', or '='). The code follows the problem description accurately for all potential cases. The annotations provide additional clarity on the state of the variables and the logic flow within the code, confirming that it aligns with the problem requirements. All provided examples in the problem description are handled correctly by the code. Therefore, the code is correct.
