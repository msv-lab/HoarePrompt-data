Example Answer: 
`b` is assigned the value of the second element of the list `data` with leading zeros removed. Since `b` is already a non-negative integer represented as a string, the leading zeros are stripped. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros represented as a string.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros represented as a string, `b` is a non-negative integer without leading zeros represented as a string**
