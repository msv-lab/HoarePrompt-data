The function `func_1` does not accept any parameters. The function processes two non-negative integers, `a` and `b`, represented as strings. The integers `a` and `b` contain no more than 10^6 digits each. The function does not return any value explicitly, but it performs some operations on the input integers `a` and `b`.
