Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers without leading zeros represented as strings. If `a` is an empty string, then both `a` and `b` are set to '0'. Otherwise, `a` remains unchanged, and if `b` is an empty string, it is set to '0'. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. The values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.***
