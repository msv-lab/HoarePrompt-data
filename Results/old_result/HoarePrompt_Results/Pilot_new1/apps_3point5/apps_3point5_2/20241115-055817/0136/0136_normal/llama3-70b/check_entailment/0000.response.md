Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros, compares them, and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if the first number is less than the second, and '>' if the first number is greater than the second. The code handles the case where the numbers are equal, where one number is less than the other, and where one number is greater than the other. The code also correctly handles cases where there are leading zeros in the input strings by stripping them before comparison. The output matches the problem description for all potential cases, making the code correct.
