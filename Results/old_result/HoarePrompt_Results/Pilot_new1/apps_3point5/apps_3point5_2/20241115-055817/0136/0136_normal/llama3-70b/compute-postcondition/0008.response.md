Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the character '>'. No variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state is: `a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros, and they are not equal to each other. `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with no leading zeros, and they are not equal to each other. `a` is greater than or equal to `b`**
