Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input as a whole line, which is in line with the problem description.
2. It removes leading zeroes from both numbers a and b.
3. It correctly compares the length of a and b, and if they are equal, it compares the actual values of a and b.
4. The program outputs "<" if a < b, ">" if a > b, and "=" if a = b, as required by the problem description.
5. The program handles the case where a or b is all zeros by converting it to '0'.
6. The program covers all possible cases mentioned in the problem description.
