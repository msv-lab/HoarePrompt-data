Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing two elements. If `data[0]` originally had leading zeros removed and was empty, it is set to '0'. Otherwise, `data[0]` remains unchanged. `data[1]` retains its original value with leading zeros removed. `b` is set to '0'. The program checks the lengths of `data[0]` and `b`. If the length of `data[0]` is less than the length of `b`, the program prints '<'. If the length of `data[0]` is greater than the length of `b`, the program prints '>'. If `data[0]` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `data[0]` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `data[0]` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='.***
