The function `func` reads two non-negative integers represented as strings, removes leading zeros, and compares them. If the two integers are equal, it prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. Otherwise, if `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, it prints '>'. The function does not explicitly return any value. However, an important missing functionality is handling cases where the input strings are not valid non-negative integers.
