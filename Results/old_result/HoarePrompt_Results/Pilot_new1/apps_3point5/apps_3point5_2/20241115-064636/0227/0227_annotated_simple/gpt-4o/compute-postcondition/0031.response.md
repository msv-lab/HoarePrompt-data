Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. `assigned` contains the first `n` elements of `a`. `x` iterates over each element in `assigned`. `m` is incremented by 1. `i` is 2. `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If the element at index `i` in `a` minus `x` is present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.***
