Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly solves the problem as described. It first reads the input values and sorts them. Then it iterates through the sorted list and checks if the current element is not double of the previous element. If it's not, it increments the variable m. Finally, it prints the value of m if it's less than or equal to 23, otherwise, it prints -1.

The logic of the program ensures that the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations is calculated correctly. The program handles all potential cases and produces the correct output.
