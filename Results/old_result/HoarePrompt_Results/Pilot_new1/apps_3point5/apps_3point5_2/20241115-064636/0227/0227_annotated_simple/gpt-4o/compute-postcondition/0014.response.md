Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty, `x` is the next element in `assigned`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2. If `a[i] - x` is found in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True and the loop is exited.***
