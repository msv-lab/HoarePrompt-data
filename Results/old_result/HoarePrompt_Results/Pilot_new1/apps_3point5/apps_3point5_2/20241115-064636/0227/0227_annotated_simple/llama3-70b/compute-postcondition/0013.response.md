Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not twice the element at index `i - 1`, `m` is increased by 1, resulting in `m` being either 3 or 4. All initial conditions are preserved, with `n` still greater than 1 and `i` less than `n`.***
