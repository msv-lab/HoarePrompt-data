Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. The list `a` contains `n` distinct positive integers, so after sorting, the list `a` will be in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order**.
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order**
