Example Answer:
The list `a` is sorted in ascending order. Since `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers, sorting it will rearrange the elements in ascending order. The previous values of the elements in the list are not known, so the output state is: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order**.
Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order**
