Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is not empty, `x` is the first element of `a`, `m` is 1, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `can_form` is True, the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in the `assigned` list. We break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
