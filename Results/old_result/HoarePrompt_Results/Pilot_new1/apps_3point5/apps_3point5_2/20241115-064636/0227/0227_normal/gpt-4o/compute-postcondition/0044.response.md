Postcondition: ***If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and the first element in `assigned` is present in `assigned`, `can_form` is True, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` contains the new element `a[i]`, and the loop is terminated. If the difference is not present in `assigned`, `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, and `assigned` contains the new element `a[i]`. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute.***
