Output State: **If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False. If `assigned` is not empty, the loop iterates through each element `x` in `assigned`. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False.**
