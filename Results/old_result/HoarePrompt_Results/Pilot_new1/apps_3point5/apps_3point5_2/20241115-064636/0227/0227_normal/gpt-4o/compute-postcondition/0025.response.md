According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, the conditions for the loop to break were not met, so the loop will execute one more time. However, if `can_form` was initially False, `m` needs to be increased by 1 and the new element `a[i]` should be added to `assigned`.
State: **If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and the first element in `assigned` is not present in `assigned`, `can_form` is False. `m` is increased by 1 and `assigned` contains the new element `a[i]`.**
