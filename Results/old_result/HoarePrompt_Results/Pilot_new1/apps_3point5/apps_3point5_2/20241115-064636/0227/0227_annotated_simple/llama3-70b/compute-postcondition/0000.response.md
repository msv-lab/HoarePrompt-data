Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Other variables are not affected, so the output state is: a is a list of n distinct positive integers, where 1 <= n <= 23 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each 1 <= i <= n; `n` is an input integer.
Output State: **a is a list of n distinct positive integers, where 1 <= n <= 23 and 1 <= a_i <= 10^9 for each 1 <= i <= n; `n` is an input integer**
