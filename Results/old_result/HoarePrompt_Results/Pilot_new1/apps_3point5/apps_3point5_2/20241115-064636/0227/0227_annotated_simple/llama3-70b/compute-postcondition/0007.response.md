Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is an integer. If the element at index i in list `a` is not twice the value of the element at index i - 1, `m` is increased by 1. The final state after the execution of the if statement is that `a` remains unchanged, `m` is either 1 or 2 depending on the condition, and `n` is greater than 1.***
