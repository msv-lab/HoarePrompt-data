Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is an integer. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not twice the value of the element at index `i-1`, then `m` is increased by 1.***
