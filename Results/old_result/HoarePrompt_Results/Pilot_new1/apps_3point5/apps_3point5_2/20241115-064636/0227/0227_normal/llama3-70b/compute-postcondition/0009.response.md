Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is an integer greater than 1, `i` is increased by 1 based on the loop iteration. If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not twice the value of the element at index `i-1` and this condition is met, then `m` is increased by 1.**
