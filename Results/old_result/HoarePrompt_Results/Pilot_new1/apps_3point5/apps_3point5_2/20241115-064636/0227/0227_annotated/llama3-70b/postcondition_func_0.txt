The function reads an integer `n` from the input, followed by a list of `n` distinct positive integers in ascending order. It then iterates through the list to count the number of adjacent elements that are not in a ratio of 1:2. The final count `m` is printed, unless it exceeds 23, in which case -1 is printed. If `n` is 1, `m` remains 1.
