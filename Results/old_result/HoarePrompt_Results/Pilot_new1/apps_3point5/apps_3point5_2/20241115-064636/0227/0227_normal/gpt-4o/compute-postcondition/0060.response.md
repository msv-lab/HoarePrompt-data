Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If a[i] - x exists in the `assigned` list, `can_form` is set to True and the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. The `assigned` list must have at least 3 elements, and `x` should be the third element in the list for this condition to be met. If the condition is not satisfied, there is no change in the values of the variables.***
