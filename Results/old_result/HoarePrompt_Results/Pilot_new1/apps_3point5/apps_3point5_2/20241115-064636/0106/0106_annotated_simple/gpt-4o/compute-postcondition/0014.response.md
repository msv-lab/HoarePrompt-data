Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts five positive integer parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000 and 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k. It calculates the total time required by adding the time to exit, minimum walk time, and time to the target floor. The time to exit is 0 if `floor_a` is 1, otherwise it is calculated as 10 + (`floor_a` - 1). The minimum walk time is determined by the absolute difference in blocks multiplied by 15. The function correctly handles all possible scenarios for `floor_a` and calculates the total time accordingly.**
