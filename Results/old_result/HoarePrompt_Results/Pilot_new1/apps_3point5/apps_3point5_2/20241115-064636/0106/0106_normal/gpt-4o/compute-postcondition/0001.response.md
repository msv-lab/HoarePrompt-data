Example Answer:
The variable `floor_within_block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The formula calculates the floor within a block based on the apartment number. The output state depends on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` at the time of execution.
Output State: **Depends on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k` at the time of execution**
