Example Answer:
`a_floor` is assigned the value of `(a - 1) % m + 1`. The previous values of `a` and `m` are known, so we can calculate the result. If `a` is 10 and `m` is 3, then `a_floor` would be `(10 - 1) % 3 + 1 = 2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split after converting to integers; `a` and `b` are the input integers, `a_floor` is the calculated value based on the formula.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `k` are assigned the values from the input split after converting to integers; `a` and `b` are the input integers, `a_floor` is the calculated value based on the formula**
