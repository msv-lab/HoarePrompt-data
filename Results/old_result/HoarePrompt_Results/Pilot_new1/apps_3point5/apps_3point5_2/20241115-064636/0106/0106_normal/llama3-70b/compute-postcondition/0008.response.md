Output State: **`a` and `b` are assigned integer values from the input split operation, `n` and `m` have unknown values, `k` has an unknown value, `a_block` is calculated based on the given formula, `b_floor` is calculated as ((b - 1) % m) + 1, `b_block` is calculated as (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` is calculated based on the formula min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15, `min_floor_time` is calculated as (a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10**
