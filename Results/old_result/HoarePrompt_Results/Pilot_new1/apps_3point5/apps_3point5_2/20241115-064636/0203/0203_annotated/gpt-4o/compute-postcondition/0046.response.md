The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the predefined constraints. The function should output a string representing the party that has the majority of votes among the employees. If the number of 'D's (depublican employees) is greater than the number of 'R's (remocrat employees), the function should return 'D'. If the number of 'R's is greater than the number of 'D's, the function should return 'R'. If the number of 'D's and 'R's are equal, the function should return 'Tie'. 

Functionality: **The function determines the majority party among the employees based on the input string votes and returns the corresponding party ('D' for depublican, 'R' for remocrat, or 'Tie' for a tie).**
