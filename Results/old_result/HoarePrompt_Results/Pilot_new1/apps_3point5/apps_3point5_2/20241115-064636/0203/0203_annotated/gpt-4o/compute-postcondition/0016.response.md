Example Answer: 
If the value of `v` is not 'D', then the code appends the value of `i` to the `r_queue` list. Since `i` is the index of the last character processed + 1, the value of `i` is appended to the `r_queue` list. If the value of `v` is 'D', then the code does not affect the state as it only appends to the `r_queue` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `votes` contains at least 2 characters, if `v` is 'D', `d_queue` contains the value of `i`, otherwise `r_queue` contains 2 elements with the second element being the value of `i`. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` contains at least 2 characters, if `v` is 'D', `d_queue` contains the value of `i`, otherwise `r_queue` contains 2 elements with the second element being the value of `i`**
