Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least one character, `d_queue` contains the updated indices of 'D' characters, `r_queue` contains the indices of 'R' characters. If there are no 'D' characters in the `votes` string, `d_queue` remains empty. If there are no 'R' characters in the `votes` string, `r_queue` remains empty. `r_index` is the index popped from the front of `r_queue`. The index of 'D' character in `votes` is less than the index of 'R' character in `votes`.***
