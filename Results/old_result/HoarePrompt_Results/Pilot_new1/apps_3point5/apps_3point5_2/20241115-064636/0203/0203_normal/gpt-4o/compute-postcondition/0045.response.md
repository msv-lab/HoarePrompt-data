Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer. After the loop executes, `d_queue` contains the indices of characters with 'D', `r_queue` contains the indices of characters with 'R'. If there are no 'D' characters in the `votes` list, `d_queue` is empty. If there are no 'R' characters in the `votes` list, `r_queue` is empty. The loop continues to execute as long as both `d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. After each iteration, `d_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` appends `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` has an additional element which is `r_index + n`. The loop handles all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the correct state of the queues and indices. When the if block executes, 'D' is printed; otherwise, 'R' is printed.***
