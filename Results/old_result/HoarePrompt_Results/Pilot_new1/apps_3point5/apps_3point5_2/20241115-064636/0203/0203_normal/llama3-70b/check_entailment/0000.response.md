Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads the number of employees and their fractions correctly. It then counts the occurrences of each fraction and prints 'D' if there are more depublicans than remocrats, otherwise it prints 'R'. The code follows the problem description for every potential case. The output hints also agree with the code and provide a clear explanation of how the code determines the outcome of the vote based on the fractions of the employees. The code covers all possible scenarios described in the problem statement and gives the correct output for each one.
