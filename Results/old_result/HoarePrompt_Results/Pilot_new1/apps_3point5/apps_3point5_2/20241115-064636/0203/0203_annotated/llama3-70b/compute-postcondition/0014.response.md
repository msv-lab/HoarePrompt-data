According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If there are more fractions to iterate through, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is a positive integer representing the number of employees, fractions is assigned the input value and is not empty. If fraction is 'D', then depublicans is incremented by 1. If fraction is not 'D', then remocrats is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following modifications need to be made:
- If the last fraction processed was 'D', then depublicans should be incremented by 1.
- If the last fraction processed was not 'D', then remocrats should be incremented by 1.
- The integrity of the employee count and the political affiliation count should be maintained.

State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees, fractions is assigned the input value and is not empty. If the last fraction processed was 'D', then depublicans is incremented by 1. If the last fraction processed was not 'D', then remocrats is incremented by 1.**
