Example Answer:
`d_queue` is initialized as an empty list. Since the initialization of `d_queue` does not affect the values of `n` and `votes`, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' and 'R', `d_queue` is an empty list**
