According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `n` being an input integer is not directly related to the loop execution, so it does not need to be adjusted. For the loop to execute, the fractions list must have at least 1 element. At the start of the loop, `fraction` will be the first element in the list.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `republicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, fractions list has at least 1 element, `fraction` is the first element in the list**
