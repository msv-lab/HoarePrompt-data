Postcondition: ***If both d_queue and r_queue are not empty, after the loop executes, d_queue contains the updated indices of 'D' characters with the addition of n if d_index < r_index. If d_queue becomes empty before r_queue, then d_queue remains empty. If there are no 'D' characters in the votes string, d_queue remains empty.***
