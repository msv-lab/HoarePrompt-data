According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the length of the `votes` string. If there are more characters left in the `votes` string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least 2 characters, `i` is 1, `v` is the second character of the `votes` string. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. If the first character of `votes` is 'D', then `d_queue` contains the values from 0 to i appended to it, `r_queue` is empty, and `v` is 'D', then `d_queue` should have i+1 appended to it.
2. If the first character of `votes` is not 'D', then `r_queue` contains the values from 0 to i appended to it, `d_queue` is empty, and `v` is not 'D', then `r_queue` should have i+1 appended to it.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n with at least 2 characters, `i` is 2, `v` is the third character of the `votes` string.**
