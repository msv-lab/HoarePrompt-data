Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `votes` contains at least 1 character. If `v` is 'D', `d_queue` contains the value of `i`, otherwise `r_queue` contains 1 element which is 0. In the case where `v` is not 'D', `r_queue` contains 2 elements with the second element being the value of `i`. `i` is the index of the last character processed + 1.***
