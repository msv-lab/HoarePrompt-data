The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function is responsible for determining the final outcome of a vote based on the fractions of employees participating in the vote, where 'D' represents depublicans and 'R' represents remocrats. The function will return the winning party after analyzing the input characters according to the following rules:
- If there are more 'D' characters than 'R' characters, the function will return "Depublicans win".
- If there are more 'R' characters than 'D' characters, the function will return "Remocrats win".
- If the number of 'D' and 'R' characters are equal, the function will return "Tie". 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to determine the winning party based on the fractions of employees participating in the vote represented by 'D' and 'R'.
