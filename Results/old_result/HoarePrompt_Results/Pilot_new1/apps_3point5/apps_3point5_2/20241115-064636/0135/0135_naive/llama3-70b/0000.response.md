Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly checks if all the remainders obtained by dividing n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of the remainders seen so far and if it encounters a duplicate remainder, it immediately prints "No" and exits the program. If all remainders are distinct, it prints "Yes" at the end. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases where duplicate remainders might occur.
