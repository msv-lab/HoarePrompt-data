The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, then iterates from 1 to `k` calculating the remainder of `n` divided by each number. If any remainder is already in the `seen` set, it prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, it adds the remainders to the `seen` set and prints 'Yes'. The function does not calculate or return the value of n^k as stated in the annotations.
