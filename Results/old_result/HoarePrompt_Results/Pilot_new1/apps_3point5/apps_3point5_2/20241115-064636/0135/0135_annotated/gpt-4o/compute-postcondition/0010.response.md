Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as `n % i`, where `n` and `i` are not defined in the initial state. The set `seen_remainders` is still empty, and `k` is at least 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is at least 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is at least 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i**`.
