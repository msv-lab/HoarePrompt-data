Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly checks if all the remainders modulo i are distinct for 1 ≤ i ≤ k. It first checks if k is greater than or equal to n, in which case it immediately returns 'No'. Then it iterates over all integers i from 1 to k and keeps track of the remainders in a set. If it encounters a remainder that is already in the set, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes' at the end. The program covers all potential cases and correctly follows the problem description.
