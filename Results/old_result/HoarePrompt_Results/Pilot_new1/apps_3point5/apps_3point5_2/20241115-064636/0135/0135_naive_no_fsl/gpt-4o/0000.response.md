Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes two integers n and k as input, then checks if all the remainders of n modulo i, where i ranges from 1 to k, are distinct. If any remainder is repeated, it returns 'No', otherwise it returns 'Yes'.

The program follows the problem description accurately by checking for distinct remainders for all i from 1 to k. It correctly returns 'No' if k is greater than or equal to n, as it is not possible to have distinct remainders in that case. Otherwise, it iterates through all values of i and checks for distinct remainders, returning 'No' if a repeated remainder is found and 'Yes' otherwise.

Since the program covers all potential cases and accurately implements the logic described in the problem statement, the correctness of the program is true.
