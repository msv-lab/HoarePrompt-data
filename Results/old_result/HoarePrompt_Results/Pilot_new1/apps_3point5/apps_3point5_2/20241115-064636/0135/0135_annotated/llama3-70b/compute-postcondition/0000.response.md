Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values by splitting the input. The values of `n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18**
