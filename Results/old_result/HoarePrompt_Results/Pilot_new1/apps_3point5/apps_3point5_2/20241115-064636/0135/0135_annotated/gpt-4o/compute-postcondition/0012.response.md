Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as `n % i`. The initial state indicates that `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is at least 1, and `i` is the next value after the last iteration. Therefore, after executing the code, the output state is: `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is at least 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`, and `i` is the next value after the last iteration.
Output State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is at least 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`, `i` is the next value after the last iteration**
