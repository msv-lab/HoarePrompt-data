According to the code, the loop will execute for values of i ranging from 1 to k (inclusive). Therefore, for the loop to execute, the value of k must be at least 1. Since the set `seen_remainders` is empty, there are no constraints on it for the loop to execute. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `seen_remainders` is an empty set and `k` is at least 1.
State: **`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `k` is at least 1**
