The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

Case_1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns the string 'No'. 

Case_2: If k is greater than or equal to n, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the initial state variables. If the remainder is in seen_remainders at any point during the loop, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, after the loop executes, n and k remain the same as the initial state, seen_remainders contains unique remainders from n % i for i in the range 1 to k, i is the next integer after the last value of i in the previous iteration, and remainder is the result of n % i.

Case_3: The program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` within the specified constraints and determine whether 'No', 'Yes' should be returned based on the conditions described in the cases.
