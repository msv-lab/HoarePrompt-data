Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`. The value of `data[index]` is unknown, so the value of `n` will depend on the value at the index in the data. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: loop will execute one more time with the same states as the end of the previous iteration, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`.
Output State: **loop will execute one more time with the same states as the end of the previous iteration, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`**
