The function `func_1` reads input from the standard input, processes the data according to the specified algorithm, and prints the results. It iterates T times, where T is the first integer in the input data. For each iteration, it calculates the balance of '0's and '1's in a given string `s`, computes prefix balances, and based on certain conditions, appends values to the results list. The final results are then printed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a specific return value specified.
