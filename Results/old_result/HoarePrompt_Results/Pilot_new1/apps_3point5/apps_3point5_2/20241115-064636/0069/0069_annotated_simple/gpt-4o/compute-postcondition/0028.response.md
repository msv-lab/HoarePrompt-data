According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is greater than 0. The loop iterates over the elements in `prefix_balances`, so for the loop to execute, `prefix_balances` must have at least 1 element. Since the balance is not equal to 0, the prefix_balances should contain non-zero values. Therefore, the state before the loop starts needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 non-zero element, and the balance is not equal to 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 non-zero element, balance is not equal to 0**
