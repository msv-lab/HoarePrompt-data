Example Answer:
If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `x` is assigned the integer value at `data[index + 1]`. Then, `s` is assigned the value at `data[index + 2]. If the condition is met, `x` will be updated accordingly, and `s` will be assigned a new value. The previous values of `n`, `x`, and `data` are needed to calculate the final result.
Output State: **If `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `x` is assigned the integer value at `data[index + 1]`, and `s` is assigned the value at `data[index + 2]`.**
