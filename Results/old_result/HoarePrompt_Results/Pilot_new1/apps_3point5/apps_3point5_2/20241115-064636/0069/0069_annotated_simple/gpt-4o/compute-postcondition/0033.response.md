Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 non-zero elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 non-zero elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is increased by 1**
