Example Answer:
The value of `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`. The values of `n` and `x` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, loop will execute one more time with adjusted states, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1]`, and `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, loop will execute one more time with adjusted states, `x` is assigned the value `int(data[index + 1]`, and `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`**
