Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is incremented by 1. The length of `prefix_balances` remains the same with all elements being zeros. `balance` is not equal to 0, and `b` is the next element in the `prefix_balances` list. If the condition is not met, no changes occur in the program state.***
