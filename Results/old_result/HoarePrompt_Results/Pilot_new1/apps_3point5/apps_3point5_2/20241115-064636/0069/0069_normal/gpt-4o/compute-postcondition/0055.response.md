According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is incremented by 3. To execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be incremented by 3 again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string, `prefix_balances` is a list containing the updated prefix sums of '0's and '1's in 's' up to index i, `n` is incremented by 6, `x` is updated based on the data list, `index` is incremented by 3, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in 's**
