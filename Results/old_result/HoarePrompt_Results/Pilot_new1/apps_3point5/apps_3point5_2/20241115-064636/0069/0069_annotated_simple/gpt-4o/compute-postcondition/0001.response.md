Example Answer:
The `input().split()` function takes an input and splits it based on whitespace, storing the result in the `data` variable. The `data` variable now holds a list of strings. Since the initial state is unknown, the output state is `data` is a list of strings.
Output State: **`data` is a list of strings**
