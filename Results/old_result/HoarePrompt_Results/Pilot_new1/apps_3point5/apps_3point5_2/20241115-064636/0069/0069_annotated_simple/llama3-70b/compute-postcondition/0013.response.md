Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, and `balance` is the result of `cnt0 - cnt1`. The balance is not equal to x. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0), the code prints -1. Otherwise, the code prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)***
