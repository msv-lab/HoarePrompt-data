Example Answer:
`x` is assigned the value of `int(data[index + 1])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is an integer. The value of `index` is not provided, so the exact value of `data[index + 1]` cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: loop will execute one more time with the same states as the end of the previous iteration, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, and `x` is assigned an unknown value.
Output State: **loop will execute one more time with the same states as the end of the previous iteration, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, and `x` is assigned an unknown value**
