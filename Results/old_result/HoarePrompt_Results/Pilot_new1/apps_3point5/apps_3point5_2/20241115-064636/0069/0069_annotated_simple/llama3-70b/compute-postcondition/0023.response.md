Postcondition: ***T is incremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input, `s` is assigned the input value, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`, `balance` is calculated as the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`. If the condition `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0` is true, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, the expression `(x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1` is calculated and printed. This postcondition covers all cases where the program variables are updated based on the input values and the calculated balance, ensuring the correct output is displayed.***
