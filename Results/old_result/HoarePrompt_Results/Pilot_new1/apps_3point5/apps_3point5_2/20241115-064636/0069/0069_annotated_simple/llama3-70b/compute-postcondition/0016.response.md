Example Answer:
The values of `n` and `x` are assigned by mapping the input values to integers. The previous value of `T` is not mentioned, so it remains incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: T is incremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input.
Output State: **T is incremented by 1, `n` and `x` are assigned integer values from input**
