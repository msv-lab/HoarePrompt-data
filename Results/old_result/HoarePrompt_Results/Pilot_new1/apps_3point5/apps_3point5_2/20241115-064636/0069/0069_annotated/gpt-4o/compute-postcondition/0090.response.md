According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 2, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1, so `i` should be updated to 3.
- The value of `prefix_balances[3]` needs to be calculated based on the updated `i` value and the value of `s[2]`.

State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)**
