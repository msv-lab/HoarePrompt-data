Postcondition: ***If n is greater than or equal to 1, after the execution of the if-else block, `prefix_balances` will contain the cumulative sum of 1 for each '0' encountered in the string `s`, and -1 for each '1' encountered in `s`. If balance equals 0 and x is in `prefix_balances`, -1 will be appended to `results`, and `prefix_balances` will be updated based on the occurrences of '0' and '1' in the string `s`. If x is not in `prefix_balances`, an additional 0 will be appended to `results`, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros with a length of 1. If n is less than 1, the loop will not execute, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of zeros with a length of 1. Additionally, `count` will be incremented by 1 for each element in `prefix_balances` list that satisfies the condition, and the updated `count` values will be appended to `results`.***
