Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i` in the given formula. The value of `wait_time` depends on the values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i` which are determined by the tuple at index `i`. The output state is: `n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`, `i` is less than `n`, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`, `i` is less than `n`, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the formula provided**
