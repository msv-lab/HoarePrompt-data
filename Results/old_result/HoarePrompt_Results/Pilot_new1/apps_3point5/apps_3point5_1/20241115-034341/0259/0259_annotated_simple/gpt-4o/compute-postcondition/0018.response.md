Example Answer: 
`s_i` is assigned the value `bus_routes[i][0]` and `d_i` is assigned the value `bus_routes[i][1]`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are updated based on the values in `bus_routes[i]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` is assigned the value from `bus_routes[i][0]`, and `d_i` is assigned the value from `bus_routes[i][1]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 1, `s_i` is assigned the value from `bus_routes[i][0]`, and `d_i` is assigned the value from `bus_routes[i][1]**.
