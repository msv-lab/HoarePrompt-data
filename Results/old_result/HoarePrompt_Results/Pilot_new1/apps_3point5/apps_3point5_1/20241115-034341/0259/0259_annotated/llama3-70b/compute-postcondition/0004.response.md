Example Answer: 
A tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are based on user input, so the specific values are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer satisfying the constraints, `s` and `d` are assigned based on user input, and the list `buses` contains the new tuple `(s, d)`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is an integer satisfying the constraints, `s` and `d` are assigned based on user input, `buses` contains the new tuple `(s, d)`**
