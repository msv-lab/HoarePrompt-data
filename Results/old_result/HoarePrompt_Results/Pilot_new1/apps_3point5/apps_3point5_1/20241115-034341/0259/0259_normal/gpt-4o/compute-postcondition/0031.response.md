Example Answer:
`wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`, where `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of `bus_routes[i]`. The initial state of `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `n` are not affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, `n` is increased by 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of `bus_routes[i]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, `n` is increased by 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of `bus_routes[i]`**
