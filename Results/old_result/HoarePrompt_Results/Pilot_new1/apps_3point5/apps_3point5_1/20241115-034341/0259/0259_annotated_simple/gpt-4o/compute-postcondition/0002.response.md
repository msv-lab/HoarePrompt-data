According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Since `min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity and `chosen_route` is -1, these values do not impact the loop execution directly. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0.
State: **`min_wait_time` is initialized to positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0**
