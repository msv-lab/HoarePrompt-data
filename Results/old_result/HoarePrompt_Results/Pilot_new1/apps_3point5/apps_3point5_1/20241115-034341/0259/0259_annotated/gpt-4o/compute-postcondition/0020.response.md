Example Answer:
`wait_time` is assigned the value 0. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: `n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`, `wait_time` is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `s_i` and `d_i` are determined by the tuple at index `i`, `wait_time` is 0**
