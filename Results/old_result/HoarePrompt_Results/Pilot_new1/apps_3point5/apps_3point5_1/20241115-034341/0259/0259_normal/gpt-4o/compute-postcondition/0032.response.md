Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`, `n` is increased by 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of `bus_routes[i]`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is equal to `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This logic covers all possible scenarios when determining the wait time based on the bus route parameters and the current time `t`.***
