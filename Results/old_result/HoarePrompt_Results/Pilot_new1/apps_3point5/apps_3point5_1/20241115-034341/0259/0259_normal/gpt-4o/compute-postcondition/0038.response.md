Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes. `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the selected bus route. `n` is a non-negative integer representing the total number of bus routes. `i` is the index of the current bus route being processed. `s_i` is the source of bus route `i`, and `d_i` is the destination of bus route `i`. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. After the if statement executes, `min_wait_time` is updated to the minimum `wait_time` value, and `chosen_route` is set to `i + 1`. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute, and `min_wait_time` remains positive infinity, while `chosen_route` remains -1.**
