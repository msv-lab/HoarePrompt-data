According to the code, the loop will execute n times. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains 'bus1' and an additional tuple `(s, d)`. To execute the loop one more time, the value of `n` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains 'bus1' and an additional tuple `(s, d)`**
