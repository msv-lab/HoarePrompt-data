Example Answer:
A new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the list `buses`. The values of `s` and `d` are integers from the input split. The list `buses` now contains an additional tuple. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `buses` is a list containing tuples `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are integers from the input split.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 100,000, `buses` is a list containing tuples `(s, d)` where `s` and `d` are integers from the input split**
