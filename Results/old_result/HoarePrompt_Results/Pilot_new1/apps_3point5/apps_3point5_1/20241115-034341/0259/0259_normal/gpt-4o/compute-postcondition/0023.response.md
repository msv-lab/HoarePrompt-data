Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes, `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the selected bus route, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 1, `s_i` is the updated source of bus route `i`, `d_i` is the updated destination of bus route `i`, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the conditions:
- If `s_i >= t`, `wait_time` is equal to `s_i - t`.
- If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is 0.
- If neither of the above conditions are met, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
