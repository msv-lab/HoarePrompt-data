Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer such that 10 ≤ s ≤ 99; `teens` is a list of strings representing numbers in the teens range; `tens` is a list of strings representing tens digits from 20 to 90. If 10 ≤ s < 20, the code snippet prints the string from the `teens` list corresponding to the value of `s` - 10. If 20 ≤ s ≤ 99, the code snippet prints the corresponding string representation of the input integer `s` based on the `tens` and `ones` lists. The program covers all edge cases and correctly handles the boundary values of the input integer `s`.***
