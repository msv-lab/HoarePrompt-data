Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 10 <= s <= 99, `teens` is a list containing string elements representing numbers from eleven to nineteen, `tens` is a list containing string elements representing tens from zero to ninety. The value of `n` is an integer between 10 and 99, exclusive of 11 to 19. If n % 10 == 0, the function returns the string element representing the tens place of the integer 'n' from the list 'tens'. Otherwise, the function returns a string that represents the number `n` in words, where `tens` represents the tens digit and `ones` represents the ones digit. The postcondition covers all edge cases including when n is a multiple of 10 and when it is not, ensuring the correct representation of the number in words.***
