The function func_1 accepts an integer n and returns the string representation of that number based on specific conditions. If n is between 0 and 9, it returns the string representation from the 'ones' list. If n is between 11 and 19, it returns the string representation from the 'teens' list. If n is between 10 and 99, excluding the range of 11 to 19, it checks if n is divisible by 10. If n is divisible by 10, it returns the string representing the tens place of n. If n is not divisible by 10, the function returns the concatenation of the string representing the tens place of n with a hyphen and the string representing the ones place of n. The actual code covers these cases accurately.
