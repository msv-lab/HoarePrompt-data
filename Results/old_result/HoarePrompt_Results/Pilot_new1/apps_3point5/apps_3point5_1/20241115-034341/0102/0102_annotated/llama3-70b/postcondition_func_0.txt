The function takes an integer input `s` and prints out the English representation of that number. If `s` is less than 10, it prints the English name of the corresponding digit. If `s` is between 10 and 19, it prints the English name of the number from the teens list. If `s` is between 20 and 99, it prints the English representation using the ones and tens lists, accounting for all possible cases and edge cases, including when `s` is a multiple of 10. The function does not accept any parameters and returns the English representation of the input number.
