Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99 and the list `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine. The function returns the word representing the number at index 'n' in the list 'ones' if 0 ≤ n ≤ 9. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the word representing the number 's' in the list 'ones'. For the range 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 excluding 11-19, if n is divisible by 10, the function returns the word representing the tens place of n. If n is not divisible by 10, the function returns the concatenation of the word representing the tens place of n, a hyphen, and the word representing the ones place of n. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases, ensuring the correct output based on the specified conditions in the program fragment.***
