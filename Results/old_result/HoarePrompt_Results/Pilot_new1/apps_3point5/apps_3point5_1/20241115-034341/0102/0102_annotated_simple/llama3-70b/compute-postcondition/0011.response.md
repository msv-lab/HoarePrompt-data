Postcondition: ***`s` is an input integer such that 10 <= s <= 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine, `tens` is a list of strings representing multiples of ten from twenty to ninety. If s < 20, the code prints the string at index (s-10) in the `teens` list. If 20 <= s <= 99, the code prints the string representation of the input integer `s` in words. The postcondition encompasses all possible cases for the input integer `s` within the specified range, ensuring correct output based on the conditions met.***
