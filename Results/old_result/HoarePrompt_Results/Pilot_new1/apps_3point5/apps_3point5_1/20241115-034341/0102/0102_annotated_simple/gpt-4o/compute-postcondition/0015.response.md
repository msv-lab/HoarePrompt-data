Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 10 ≤ s ≤ 99 and the list `ones` contains words representing numbers from zero to nine. The value of `n` is an integer between 10 and 99, excluding numbers between 11 and 19. If `n` is divisible by 10, the function returns the word representing the tens place of `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, the function returns the concatenation of the word representing the tens place of `n`, a hyphen, and the word representing the ones place of `n`. The postcondition ensures that the output is correctly determined based on the conditions specified in the program fragment, covering all possible scenarios and edge cases.***
