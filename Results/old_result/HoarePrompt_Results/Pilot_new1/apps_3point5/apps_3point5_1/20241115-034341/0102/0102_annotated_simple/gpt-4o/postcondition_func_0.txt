The function func_1 takes an integer parameter n and returns the word representation of that number based on specific conditions. If n is between 0 and 9, it returns the word representation of the number from a predefined list. For numbers between 11 and 19, it returns the corresponding word from another predefined list. For numbers between 10 and 99 (excluding 11-19), it returns the word representation of the tens place if divisible by 10, or the concatenation of the word representation of the tens place and ones place separated by a hyphen if not divisible by 10. The function handles edge cases for various ranges of n and ensures the correct word representation is returned based on the specified conditions.
