Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates the positions of the minimum and maximum elements, then calculates the maximum possible distance between them after swapping. The logic used in the code ensures that the minimum and maximum elements are as far apart as possible after exactly one swap. The code also considers edge cases such as when the minimum and maximum elements are already at the ends of the array. Overall, the code covers all scenarios as described in the problem statement.
