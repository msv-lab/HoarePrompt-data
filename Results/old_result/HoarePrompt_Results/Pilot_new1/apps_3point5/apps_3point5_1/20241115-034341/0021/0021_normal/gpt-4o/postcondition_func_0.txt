The function func reads an integer n from the user input, then reads a list of integers from the user input. It finds the positions of the minimum and maximum values in the list, calculates the distances of each position from the ends of the list, and determines the maximum distance among them. Finally, it prints the maximum distance. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly, but it relies on user input for n and the list of integers.
