Example Answer:
`dist3` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`. The value of `min_pos` represents the index of 1 in list `a`. Since `min_pos` is the index of 1, the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos` would be equal to `min_pos`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list a, `max_pos` is the index of n in list a, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and max_pos, `dist2` is the absolute difference between n - 1 and max_pos, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos.
Output State: **`n` is an integer between 2 and 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers between 1 and n, `min_pos` is the index of 1 in list a, `max_pos` is the index of n in list a, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and max_pos, `dist2` is the absolute difference between n - 1 and max_pos, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and min_pos**
