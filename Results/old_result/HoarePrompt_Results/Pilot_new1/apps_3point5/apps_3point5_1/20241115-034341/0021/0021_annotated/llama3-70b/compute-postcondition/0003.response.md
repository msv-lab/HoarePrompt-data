Example Answer:
`posn` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a`. Since `a` contains `n` distinct integers from 1 to n, the index of `n` in list `a` will be `n-1`. Therefore, `posn` is assigned the value `n-1`. The other variables are not affected. 
Output State: **n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, a contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, pos1 is 0, posn is n-1**
