Example Answer:
`posn` is assigned the index of `n` in list `a` using the `index` function. The value of `n` is between 2 and 100, and `a` is a list of distinct integers from 1 to n, so `posn` will be the index of `n` in list `a`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of n in list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is the index of 1 in list `a`, `posn` is the index of n in list `a`**
