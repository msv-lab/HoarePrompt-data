The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list `a` of n distinct integers. It then calculates the maximum distance of the indices of the values 0, n-1, 1, and n-2 from the indices of the minimum and maximum values in the list `a`. The function prints the maximum distance as the output. The function assumes that n is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, and the list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n (1 ≤ a_{i} ≤ n).
