The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is a non-negative integer. The function calculates the result of the expression n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)), where `multiplier` is equal to 2 raised to the power of `k`. The function then returns this calculated result. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a non-negative integer `k`, calculate n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)), and return the result of this calculation.
