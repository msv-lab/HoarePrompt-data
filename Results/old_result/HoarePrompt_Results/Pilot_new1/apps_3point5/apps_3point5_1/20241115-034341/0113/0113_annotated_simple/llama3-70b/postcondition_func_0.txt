The function reads two integers `n` and `k` from input, calculates the value of `x` as 10 raised to the power of `k`, then increments `n` until it is divisible by `x`, and finally prints the resulting value of `n`. The function ensures that `n` and `k` are positive integers where `1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9` and `0 ≤ k ≤ 8`.
