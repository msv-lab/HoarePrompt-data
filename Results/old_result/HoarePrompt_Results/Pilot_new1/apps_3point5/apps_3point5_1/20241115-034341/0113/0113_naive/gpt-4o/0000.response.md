Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the k-rounding of n as specified in the problem description. It calculates the multiplier by raising 10 to the power of k, then calculates x by multiplying n with the multiplier divided by the greatest common divisor of n and the multiplier. The result is then printed, which is the k-rounding of n. The program handles all potential cases and produces the correct output.
