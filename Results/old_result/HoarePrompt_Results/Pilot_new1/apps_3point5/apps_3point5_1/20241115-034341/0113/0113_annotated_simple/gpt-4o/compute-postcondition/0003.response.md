The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The preconditions for these parameters are that they are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, the program returns the value of variable 'x'. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integers `n` and `k`, and return the value of variable 'x'.
