Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `n` and `k`. `n` is a positive integer, and `k` is a non-negative integer. The function calculates the result of the expression n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)), where `multiplier` is equal to 10 raised to the power of `k`. The function then returns this calculated result. **
