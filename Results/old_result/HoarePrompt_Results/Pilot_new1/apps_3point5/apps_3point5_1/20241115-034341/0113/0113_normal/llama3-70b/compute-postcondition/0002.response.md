Example Answer:
The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is unknown, but it is mentioned that `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, after execution, `n` will be one more than its previous value. The value of `k` is not affected, and `x` is calculated based on the value of `k`, which is not provided. Hence, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is an integer between 0 and 8, and `x` is calculated based on the value of `k`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer incremented by 1, `k` is an integer between 0 and 8, `x` is calculated based on the value of `k`**
