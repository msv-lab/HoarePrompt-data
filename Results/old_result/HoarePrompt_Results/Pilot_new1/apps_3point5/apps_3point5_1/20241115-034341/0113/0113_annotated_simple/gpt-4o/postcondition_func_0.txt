The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. It calculates the value of variable 'x' based on the formula n * (10^k // gcd(n, 10^k)), where gcd represents the greatest common divisor. The function then returns the calculated value of 'x'.
