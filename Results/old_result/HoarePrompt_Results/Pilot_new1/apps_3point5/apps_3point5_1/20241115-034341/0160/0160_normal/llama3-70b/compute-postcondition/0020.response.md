Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`, where `i` is 2. The value of `max_divisor` is updated to 2. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A, A is a list of N integers where N is at least 2, K is a non-negative integer, int(math.sqrt(gcd)) is at least 1, i is 2, max_divisor is updated to 2.
Output State: **gcd is the greatest common divisor of all elements in list A, A is a list of N integers where N is at least 2, K is a non-negative integer, int(math.sqrt(gcd)) is at least 1, i is 2, max_divisor is updated to 2**
