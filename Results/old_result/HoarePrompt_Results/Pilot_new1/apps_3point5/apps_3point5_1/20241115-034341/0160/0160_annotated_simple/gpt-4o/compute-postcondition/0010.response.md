According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set that contains the updated divisors, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is an integer equal to 2. To execute one more time, the next iteration should have `i` incremented by 1. 
State: **`divisors` is a set that contains the updated divisors, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is an integer equal to 3**
