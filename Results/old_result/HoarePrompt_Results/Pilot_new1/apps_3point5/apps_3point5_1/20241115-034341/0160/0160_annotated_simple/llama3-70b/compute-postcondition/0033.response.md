Functionality: **The function reads two integers N and K from input, then reads a list of N integers. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the elements in the list A. Afterwards, it finds the maximum divisor of the gcd up to the square root of the gcd. Finally, it prints the max_divisor value.**
