Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of all elements in a list of integers, which is a key step in finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
2. The function `func_2` accurately determines the set of divisors of a positive integer x, including 1 and x itself, in descending order. This is essential for identifying the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
3. Both functions align with the problem description and handle the necessary calculations to find the desired output. The provided annotations also confirm that the functions are working as intended.
