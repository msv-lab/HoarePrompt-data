According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is at least 2, gcd is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current gcd and A[i], i is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **N is at least 2, gcd is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current gcd and A[1], i is 2**
