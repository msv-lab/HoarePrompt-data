According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 501, `K` is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, `A` is a list of integers obtained from the input, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current gcd and the element at index 2 in list A, `i` is 3. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 501, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A is a list of integers obtained from the input, gcd is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current gcd and the element at index 2 in list A, i is 4**
