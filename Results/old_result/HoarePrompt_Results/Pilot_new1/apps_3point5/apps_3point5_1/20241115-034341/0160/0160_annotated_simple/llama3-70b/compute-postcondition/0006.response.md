Example Answer:
The variable `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and `A[1]`, where `i` is 2. The previous value of `gcd` is unknown, but `i` is 2. Therefore, the output state is: N is at least 2, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and `A[1]`, `i` is 2.
Output State: **N is at least 2, `gcd` is updated to the greatest common divisor of the current `gcd` and `A[1]`, `i` is 2**
