Example Answer:
The variable `divisors` is initialized as an empty set. No other variables are affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **N is an integer such that 2 <= N <= 500, K is an integer such that 0 <= K <= 10^9, A_i are integers such that 1 <= A_i <= 10^6 for 1 <= i <= N. divisors is an empty set**
