According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set that contains the updated divisors after the execution of the if statement, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, and `i` is an integer equal to 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next integer value after the previous iteration. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` would be the current value of `i` plus 1.
State: **`divisors` is a set that contains the updated divisors after the execution of the if statement, `x` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `i` is an integer equal to 2**
