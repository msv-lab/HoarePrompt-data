Postcondition: ***`gcd` is a positive number, `N` is less than 2, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `i`, `i` is a divisor of `gcd`. If the square of `i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between its current value and `gcd // i`.***
