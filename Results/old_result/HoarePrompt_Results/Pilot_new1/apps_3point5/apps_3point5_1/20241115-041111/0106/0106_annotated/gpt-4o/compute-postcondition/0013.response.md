The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. The parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m, k <= 1000 and 1 <= a, b <= n * m * k. The function returns the total time calculated based on the given conditions. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept positive integers `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, and calculate and return the total time based on the given conditions.
