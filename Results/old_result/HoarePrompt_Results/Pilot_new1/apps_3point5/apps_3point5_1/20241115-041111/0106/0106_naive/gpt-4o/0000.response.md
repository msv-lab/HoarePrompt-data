Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly calculates the minimum time for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given problem description. It calculates the time for Edward to exit his apartment, walk around the building in both directions, and reach the target floor. The logic for determining the location of the apartments and calculating the time taken for each step is implemented correctly. Additionally, the program handles the circular nature of the building by calculating the minimum walking time in both directions around the building. The input constraints are also satisfied. Overall, the program meets the requirements of the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
