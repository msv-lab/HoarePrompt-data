Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts five parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, where `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the range [1, 1000], and `a` and `b` are positive integers within the range [1, n*m*k]. The function calculates the total time required to move from location `a` to location `b` within a building based on specific time calculations. It considers the time to exit, the minimum walk time between blocks, and the time to reach the target floor. The total time is then returned as `total_time`.**
