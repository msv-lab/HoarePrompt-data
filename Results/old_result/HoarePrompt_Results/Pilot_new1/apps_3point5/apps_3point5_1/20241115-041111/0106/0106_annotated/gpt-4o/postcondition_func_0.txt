The function `func_1` accepts five positive integer parameters: `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`. It calculates the total time based on specific conditions. The function first determines the time to exit based on the floor of location `a`. Then, it calculates the direct and reverse walk times between the blocks of locations `a` and `b`. The function considers the time to reach the target floor at location `b`. Finally, it computes the total time as the sum of the exit time, minimum walk time, and time to the target floor. The function returns this total time.
