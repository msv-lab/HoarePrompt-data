Example Answer:
`a_block` is calculated based on the formula provided. The value of `a` is used in the calculation, and `m` and `k` are also used. The floor division operator `//` is used to get the integer division result. After calculation, `a_block` will hold the value calculated by the formula. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from the input split into integers; `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split into integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `m`; `a_block` is calculated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned values from the input split into integers; `a` and `b` are assigned values from the input split into integers; `a_floor` is calculated based on the values of `a` and `m`; `a_block` is calculated based on the formula provided**
