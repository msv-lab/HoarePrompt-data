Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
Upon reviewing the code and the problem description, as well as the output hints, the program seems to accurately calculate the minimum time required for Edward to reach Natasha's apartment based on the given parameters. The code correctly handles the scenario where Edward and Natasha live in different blocks and floors within the circular building. The functions `func_1` and `get_location` are implemented according to the problem description, and there are no apparent missing functionalities or edge cases that the code fails to cover. Additionally, the output hints align with the code and support the correctness of the program. Therefore, based on the provided information, it can be concluded that the code is correct for all potential cases.
