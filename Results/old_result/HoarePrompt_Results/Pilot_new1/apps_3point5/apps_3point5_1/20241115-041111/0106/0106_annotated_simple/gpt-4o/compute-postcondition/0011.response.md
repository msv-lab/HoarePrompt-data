Example Answer:
`total_time` is assigned the value of the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`. The previous values of the variables are unknown, so the output state is: `total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor.
Output State: **`total_time` is the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor**
