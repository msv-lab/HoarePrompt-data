Example Answer:
The value of `floor_within_block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`. The formula calculates the floor within the block by taking the remainder of `(apartment - 1)` divided by `(m * k)`. Therefore, the Output State is: The value of `block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.
Output State: **The value of `block` is calculated based on the values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`**
