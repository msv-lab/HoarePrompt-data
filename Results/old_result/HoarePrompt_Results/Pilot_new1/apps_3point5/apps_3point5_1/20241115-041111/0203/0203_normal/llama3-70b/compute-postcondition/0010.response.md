According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `fractions`. If there are more characters left in the `fractions` string, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of employees, and `fractions` is a string of length `n` with at least 1 character. Depending on the first character of the string, either `depublicans` or `remocrats` is incremented by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the first character of the string is 'D', then `depublicans` should be incremented by 1 and `remocrats` should remain 0.
- If the first character of the string is not 'D', then `depublicans` should remain 0 and `remocrats` should be incremented by 1.
- The string `fractions` should have more characters left for the loop to execute again.

State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of employees; fractions is a string of length n with at least 1 character, depublicans and remocrats are adjusted based on the first character of the string, and there are more characters left in the string for the loop to execute one more time.**
