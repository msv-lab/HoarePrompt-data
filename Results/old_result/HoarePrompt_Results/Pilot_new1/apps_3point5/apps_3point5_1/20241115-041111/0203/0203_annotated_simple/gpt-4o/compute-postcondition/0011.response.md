Example Answer:
The value of `i` is appended to `d_queue`. Since `i` is 1, `d_queue` now contains the value 1. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length at least 2, d_queue contains 1, and r_queue is empty.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length at least 2, d_queue contains 1, and r_queue is empty**
