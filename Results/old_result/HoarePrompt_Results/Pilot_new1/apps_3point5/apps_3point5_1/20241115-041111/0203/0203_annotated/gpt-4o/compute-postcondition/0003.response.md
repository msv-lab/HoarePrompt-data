Example Answer:
`r_queue` is initialized as an empty list. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer representing the number of employees; `votes` is a string consisting of n characters representing the political affiliations of the employees; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer representing the number of employees; `votes` is a string consisting of n characters representing the political affiliations of the employees; `d_queue` is an empty list; `r_queue` is an empty list**
