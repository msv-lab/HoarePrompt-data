Postcondition: ***If n is at least 1, after the loop finishes, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters and their updated indices, r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters and their updated indices. If n is 0, both d_queue and r_queue will be empty. The loop will end if either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty during the iterations. After the execution of the if-else block, if d_queue is not empty, 'D' will be printed. Otherwise, 'R' will be printed.***
