Example Answer:
The code pops the first element from the d_queue and assigns it to d_index. If d_queue is not empty, the value of d_index will be the index of the employee who voted 'D'. If d_queue is empty, an error will occur. Therefore, the Output State is: If n is greater than 0 and votes is not empty, d_queue contains indices of employees who voted 'D' except for the first one that was popped, r_queue contains indices of employees who did not vote 'D'. If n is 0 or votes is empty, both d_queue and r_queue are empty.
Output State: **If n is greater than 0 and votes is not empty, d_queue contains indices of employees who voted 'D' except for the first one that was popped, r_queue contains indices of employees who did not vote 'D'. If n is 0 or votes is empty, both d_queue and r_queue are empty.**
