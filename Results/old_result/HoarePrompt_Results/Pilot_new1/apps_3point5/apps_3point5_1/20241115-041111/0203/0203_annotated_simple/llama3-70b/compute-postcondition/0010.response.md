According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If the list has at least 2 fractions, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, the fractions list has at least 1 fraction. Based on the values of `depublicans` and `remocrats`, the next iteration should have one of them incremented by 1 based on the fraction value, while the other remains 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the fractions list must have at least 2 fractions.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` and `remocrats` are integers. If the fraction is 'D', `depublicans` is incremented by 1 and `remocrats` remains 0. If the fraction is not 'D', `remocrats` is incremented by 1 and `depublicans` remains 0. The fractions list has at least 2 fractions, and the values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` are mutually exclusive based on the fraction value.**
