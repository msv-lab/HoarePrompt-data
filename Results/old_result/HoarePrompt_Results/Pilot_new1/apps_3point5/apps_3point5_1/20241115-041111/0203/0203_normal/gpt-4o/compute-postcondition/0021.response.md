Example Answer:
r_index is assigned the value popped from the front of r_queue. If r_queue is not empty, r_index will contain the index of the popped 'R' character. If r_queue is empty, an error will occur. The states of other variables are not affected.
Output State: **If n is at least 1, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters, r_queue will be updated after popping the front element, and d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character. If n is 0, both d_queue and r_queue will be empty, and d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character.**
