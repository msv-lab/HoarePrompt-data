Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer between 1 and 200,000, `votes` is a string of length `n` with at least 1 character. If the first character in `votes` is 'D', `d_queue` contains the index `i` and `r_queue` is an empty list. If the first character in `votes` is not 'D', `r_queue` contains the index `i` and `d_queue` is an empty list. In both cases, `i` is incremented to the next index in `votes` and `v` is the next character in `votes`.***
