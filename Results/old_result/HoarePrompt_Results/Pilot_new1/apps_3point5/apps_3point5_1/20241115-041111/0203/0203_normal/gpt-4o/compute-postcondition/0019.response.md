Output State: 
- If `n` is at least 1, the loop will execute and populate `d_queue` and `r_queue` based on the characters in the `votes` string. 
- If all characters in `votes` are 'D', `d_queue` will contain all the indices of 'D' characters, and `r_queue` will be empty.
- If all characters in `votes` are 'R', `r_queue` will contain all the indices of 'R' characters, and `d_queue` will be empty.
- If `votes` contains a mix of 'D' and 'R' characters, `d_queue` will contain the indices of 'D' characters and `r_queue` will contain the indices of 'R' characters.
- If `n` is 0, the loop will not execute, and both `d_queue` and `r_queue` will remain empty.
Output State: **If n is at least 1, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters, r_queue will contain the indices of 'R' characters. If n is 0, both d_queue and r_queue will be empty.**
