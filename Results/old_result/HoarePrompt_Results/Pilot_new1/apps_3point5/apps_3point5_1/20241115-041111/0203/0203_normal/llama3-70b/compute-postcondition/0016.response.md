Example Answer:
The value of remocrats is incremented by 1. The previous values of depublicans and remocrats are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer representing the number of employees; fractions is a string of length n with at least 2 characters remaining. If the first character of fractions is 'D', then depublicans is increased by 1. Otherwise, remocrats is incremented by 1.
