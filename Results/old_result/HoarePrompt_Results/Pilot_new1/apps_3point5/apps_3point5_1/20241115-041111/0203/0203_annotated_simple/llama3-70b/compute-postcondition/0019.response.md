Output State: **If the fractions list is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. If the fractions list contains at least one fraction, the loop iterates through each fraction incrementing either `depublicans` or `remocrats` based on the fraction value. The final values of `depublicans` and `remocrats` are mutually exclusive based on the fraction values in the list.**
