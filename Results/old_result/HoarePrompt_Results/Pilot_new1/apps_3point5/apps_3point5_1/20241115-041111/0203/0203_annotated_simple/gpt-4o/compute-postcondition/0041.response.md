Postcondition: ***`d_queue` and `r_queue` are not empty. The loop continuously pops elements from both queues, compares their values, and appends new elements based on the comparison. The loop control variables `d_index` and `r_index` hold the values of the popped elements. If at any point either `d_queue` or `r_queue` becomes empty, an error will occur.***
