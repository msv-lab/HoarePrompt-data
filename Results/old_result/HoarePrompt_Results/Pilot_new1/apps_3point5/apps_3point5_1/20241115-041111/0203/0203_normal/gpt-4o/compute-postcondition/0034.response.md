Output State: **If n is at least 1, d_queue will contain the indices of 'D' characters and the index 'd_index + n' along with the newly appended index 'd_index + n'. If n is 0, both d_queue and r_queue will be empty, and d_index will contain the index of the popped 'D' character. Additionally, if d_index < r_index, d_queue will have the new index appended, and if d_index >= r_index, r_queue will have the new index appended.**
