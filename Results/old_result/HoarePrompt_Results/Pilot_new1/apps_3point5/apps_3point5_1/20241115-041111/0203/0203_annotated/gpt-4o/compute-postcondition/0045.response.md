Postcondition: ***If n is greater than 0 and votes is not empty, d_queue will contain the updated indices of employees who voted 'D' excluding the first one, and r_queue will remain the same as before. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue will have the updated indices of employees who voted 'D' excluding the first one, and r_queue will remain the same as before. If d_index is not less than r_index, r_queue will append the value of r_index + n. If n is 0 or votes is empty, both d_queue and r_queue are empty.***
