Output State: **If `d_queue` is not empty, `d_index` is assigned the value of the first element in `d_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `r_queue` has the new element `d_index + n` appended to it. If `d_index` is not less than `r_index`, `r_queue` contains the value of `r_index + n`. If `d_queue` is empty, an error occurs. `r_index` is assigned the popped element from `r_queue`. Additionally, if `d_index < r_index`, `d_queue` has the element `d_index + n` appended to it. If `d_queue` is empty, an error occurs.**
