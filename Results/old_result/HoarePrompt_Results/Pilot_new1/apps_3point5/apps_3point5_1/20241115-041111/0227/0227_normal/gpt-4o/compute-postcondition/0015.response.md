According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more elements in `assigned` to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first and at least one more element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1. So for the loop to execute one more time, `assigned` must contain at least one more element from list `a`.
State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains at least two elements from list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1**
