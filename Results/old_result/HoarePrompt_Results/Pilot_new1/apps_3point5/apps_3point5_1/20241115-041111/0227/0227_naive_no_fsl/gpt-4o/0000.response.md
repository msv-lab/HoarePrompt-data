Correctness: False

The provided program does not correctly solve the problem as described. It does not implement the logic to check if the sequence of operations can be performed with the minimum number of variables. The program simply sorts the input sequence and counts the number of unique elements. This approach does not guarantee the minimum number of variables required to perform the operations as described in the problem statement. 

Additionally, there are issues with the input reading part of the code. The `input = sys.stdin.read` line is incorrect as it should be `input = sys.stdin.readline`. This will cause the program to fail in reading the input correctly.

Therefore, the program is incorrect and does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
