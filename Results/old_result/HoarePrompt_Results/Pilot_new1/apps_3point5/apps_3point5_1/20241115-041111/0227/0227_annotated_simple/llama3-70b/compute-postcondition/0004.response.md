According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `m` is 1 does not impact the execution of the loop. The loop will start at i = 1, so the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1, `i` is 1**
