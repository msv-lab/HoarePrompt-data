The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates based on the preconditions provided. The function calculates the sum of the squares of the first n positive integers (a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}), where n is a positive integer and a_{k} are distinct positive integers. The function then returns the result of this calculation.

Functionality: **The function calculates the sum of the squares of the first n positive integers provided in the preconditions and returns the result.**
