Example Answer:
The input is split by spaces and converted to integers using `map` and `int`, then stored in a list `a`. The value of `n` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers**
