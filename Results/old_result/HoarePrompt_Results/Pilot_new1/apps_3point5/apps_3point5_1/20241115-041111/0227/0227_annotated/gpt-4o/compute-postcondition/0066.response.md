Output State: **After the execution of the if-else block, `m` is an integer. If `can_form` is False initially, `m` is increased by 1. Otherwise, if the element at index `i + 1` in list `a` is added to the set `assigned` and `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, `can_form` is set to True and the loop is terminated. `assigned` is updated by adding the element `a[i]`.**
