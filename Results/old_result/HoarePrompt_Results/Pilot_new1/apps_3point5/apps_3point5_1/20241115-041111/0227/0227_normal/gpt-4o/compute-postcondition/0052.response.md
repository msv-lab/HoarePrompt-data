Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable that remains False, `m` remains unchanged, `i` is 1, `assigned` has at least one element. If the element at index `i` of list `a` minus `x` is present in the list `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True, and the loop or if statement is exited. Otherwise, all variables retain their initial values and states.***
