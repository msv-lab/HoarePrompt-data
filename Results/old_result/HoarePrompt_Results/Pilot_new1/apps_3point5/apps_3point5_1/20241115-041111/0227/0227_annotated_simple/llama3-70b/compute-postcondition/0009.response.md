Example Answer:
`m` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `m` is unknown, so the new value of `m` is `m + 1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is an integer increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is an integer increased by 1**
