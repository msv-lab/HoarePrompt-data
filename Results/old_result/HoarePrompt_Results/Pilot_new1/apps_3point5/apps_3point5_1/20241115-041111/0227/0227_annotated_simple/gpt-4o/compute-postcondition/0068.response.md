Output State: **`assigned` contains all unique elements of list `a`, `m` is the number of elements in `a` that cannot form a pair with any other element in `assigned`, `i` is the last index of list `a`, `n` is the length of list `a`, `can_form` is True if there exists a pair of elements in `assigned` whose difference is equal to the current element being checked, and False otherwise. If the loop does not execute, `m` is incremented by the length of list `a`**
