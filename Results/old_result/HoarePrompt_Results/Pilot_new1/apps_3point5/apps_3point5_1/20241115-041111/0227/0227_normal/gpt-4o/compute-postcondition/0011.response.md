According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the `assigned` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` contains the first element of list `a`, so for the loop to execute one more time, the `assigned` list should contain at least one more element. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the first and at least one more element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `i` is 1, `can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is in `assigned`, otherwise `can_form` remains False**
