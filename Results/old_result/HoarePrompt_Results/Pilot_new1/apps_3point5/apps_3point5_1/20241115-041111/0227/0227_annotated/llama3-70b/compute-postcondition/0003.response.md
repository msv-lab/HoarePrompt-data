Example Answer:
The value of `m` is assigned as 1. Since there are no other variables involved in the code snippet, the output state is simply: `n` is a positive integer, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` are distinct positive integers in ascending order, `m` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` are distinct positive integers in ascending order, `m` is 1**
