Example Answer: 
`m` is assigned the value `1`, and the previous values of `n` and `a` are positive integer and a list of integers sorted in ascending order respectively. The value of `m` is 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1**
