Example Answer:
The variable `assigned` is initialized as an empty set. Since this statement does not affect any other variables or data structures, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` is an empty set**
