The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, which is a positive integer, and `a`, which is a list of `n` distinct positive integers. The function returns the final value of the variable `m` after the loop execution. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a positive integer `n` and a list `a` of `n` distinct positive integers, and return the final value of the variable `m` after the loop execution.
