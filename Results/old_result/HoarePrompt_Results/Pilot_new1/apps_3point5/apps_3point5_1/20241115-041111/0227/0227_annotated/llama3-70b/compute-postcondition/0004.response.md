According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `m` is 1 is already satisfied. To adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` needs to be greater than 1 and `i` should be updated to 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 1, `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` are distinct positive integers in ascending order, `m` is 1, `i` is 1**
