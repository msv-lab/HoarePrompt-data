Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer, and `a`, a list of `n` distinct positive integers. It sorts the list `a`, then iterates through the elements to check if each element can form a pair with any previous element in the list. If an element cannot form a pair, a counter `m` is incremented. The function returns the final value of `m`, which represents the number of elements in `a` that cannot form a pair with any other element in the list.**
