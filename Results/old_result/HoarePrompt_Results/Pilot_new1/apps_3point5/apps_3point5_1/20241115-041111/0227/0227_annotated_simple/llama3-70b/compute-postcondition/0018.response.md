Functionality: **The function reads an integer n and a list of integers, sorts the list in ascending order, and then iterates through the list to count the occurrences where an element is not twice the previous element. The function prints the count if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. If n is less than or equal to 1, the function will always print 1.**
