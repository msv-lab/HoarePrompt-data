According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in `assigned` for iteration. At the end of the last iteration, `assigned` is not empty, `x` is not equal to the element at index `i` in list `a`, `assigned` contains the element at index `i` in list `a`. If the difference between the element at index `i` in list `a` and `x` is in `assigned`, `can_form` is True and the loop is broken. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `assigned` needs to be considered. 
State: **`assigned` is not empty, `x` is not equal to the element at index `i` in list `a`, `assigned` contains the element at index `i` in list `a` and the next element in `assigned` is considered.**
