Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The provided program correctly determines the minimum number of variables required to perform the described sequence of operations. It iterates through the list of integers and checks if the current integer can be formed as the sum of two previously assigned integers. If not, it increments the count of variables required. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and it handles all potential cases. The annotations also accurately describe the state of the program after the for loop is executed.
