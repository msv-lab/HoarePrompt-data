According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, the element at index `i` in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`. If `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. The loop variable `i` needs to be increased by 1, so it should be adjusted to `i + 1`.
2. If `can_form` is False, `m` should be increased by 1, so `m` should be adjusted accordingly.
3. The loop should continue executing, so `i + 1` needs to be less than `n`.

State: **The element at index `i + 1` in list `a` is added to the set `assigned`. If `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1.**
