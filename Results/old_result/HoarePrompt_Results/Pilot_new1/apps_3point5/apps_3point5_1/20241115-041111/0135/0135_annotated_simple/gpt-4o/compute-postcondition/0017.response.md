Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k` within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 
- If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'.
- If k is less than n, the function iterates from 1 to k, calculating the remainder of n divided by i. If any remainder is repeated, the function returns 'No'. If no repeated remainders are found, the function returns 'Yes'.
- The function provides outputs 'No' if k is greater than or equal to n, 'No' if any remainder is repeated during the loop iteration, and 'Yes' otherwise.**
