Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly checks if all the remainders of n modulo i, for 1 ≤ i ≤ k, are distinct. It first checks if k is greater than or equal to n, in which case it immediately returns 'No'. Then, it iterates through all values of i from 1 to k, calculates the remainder of n modulo i, and checks if this remainder has been seen before. If it has, it returns 'No'. If no duplicates are found, it returns 'Yes'. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and works as expected.
