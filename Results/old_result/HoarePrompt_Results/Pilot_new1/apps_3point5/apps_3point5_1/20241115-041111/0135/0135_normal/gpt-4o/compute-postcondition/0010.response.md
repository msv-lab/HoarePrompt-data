Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as the remainder of dividing `n` by `i`, where `i` is the next integer after the last value of `i` in the range (1 to k). The values of `n` and `k` are not altered by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to 1, i is the next integer after the last value of i in the range (1 to k); `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by i.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers satisfying 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k is greater than or equal to 1, i is the next integer after the last value of i in the range (1 to k); `remainder` is the remainder of n divided by i**
