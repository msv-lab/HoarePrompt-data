According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than or equal to `k`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `i` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k < n, i = 2, and remainder is either 0 or 1. Since `i` is 2 and k is less than n, the loop can execute one more time by incrementing `i` by 1. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is: i = 3.
State: **n, k, i are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k < n, i = 3, remainder is either 0 or 1**
