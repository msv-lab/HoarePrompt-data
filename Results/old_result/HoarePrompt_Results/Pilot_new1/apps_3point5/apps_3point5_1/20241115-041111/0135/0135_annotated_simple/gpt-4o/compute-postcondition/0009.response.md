According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, and `i` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k < n, i = 1, and remainder = 0. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **n, k, i are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k < n, i = 2, remainder = 0**
