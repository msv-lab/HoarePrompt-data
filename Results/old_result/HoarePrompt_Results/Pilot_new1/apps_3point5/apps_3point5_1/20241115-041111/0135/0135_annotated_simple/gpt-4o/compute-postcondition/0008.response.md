Postcondition: ***n, k, i are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, k < n, i = 1, remainder = 0. If the variable remainder is in the list seen_remainders, then the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, there is no change in the values of n, k, i, and remainder after the execution of the if else block.***
