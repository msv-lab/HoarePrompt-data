The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the value of n^k. The function assumes that n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate and return the value of n raised to the power of k. 
Functionality: **The function calculates and returns the value of n raised to the power of k, where n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.**
