Example Answer:
`remainder` is added to the set `seen`. The value of `remainder` is the result of `n % (i+1)`, which is not in `seen`. After adding `remainder` to `seen`, the set `seen` is updated. The variables `n`, `k`, and `i+1` are integers based on user input and remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `k`, `i+1` are integers based on user input, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `remainder` is the result of `n % (i+1)` and is not in `seen`, `seen` is updated with the new value of `remainder`.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `i+1` are integers based on user input, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `remainder` is the result of `n % (i+1)` and is not in `seen`, `seen` is updated with the new value of `remainder`**
