The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ i ≤ k. 

Case_1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the program returns 'No'. This covers all cases where k is less than n, ensuring the program returns 'No' for those scenarios.

Case_2: If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute. If n is 0, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, the loop checks if the remainder of n divided by i is already in seen_remainders. If it is, the program returns 'No'. If not, the loop adds the current remainder to seen_remainders and continues to the next iteration.

Case_3: The program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and based on the conditions described above, return either 'No' or 'Yes'.
