According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is updated with the remainder of n divided by (k + 1), `remainder` is the result of n modulo (k + 1). So for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is updated with the remainder of n divided by (k + 1), `remainder` is the result of n modulo (k + 1), `i` is incremented by 1**
