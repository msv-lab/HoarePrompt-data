Example Answer:
The set `seen` is initialized as an empty set. Since there are no previous values for `seen`, the output state is simply: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is an empty set**
