Postcondition: ***`seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `remainder` is the result of `n % i`. If `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, then the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, the program continues to the next part of the code without any changes to the initial state.***
