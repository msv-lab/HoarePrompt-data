Example Answer: 
The value of `x` is assigned as an integer converted from `data[index + 1]`. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. The `prefix_balances` list will be updated with `x` if it is not already in the list. The value of `balance` might be 0, and `count` will contain the number of elements that satisfy the conditions.
Output State: **The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. `prefix_balances` list will be updated with `x` if it is not already in the list. `balance` might be 0. `count` will contain the number of elements that satisfy the conditions.**
