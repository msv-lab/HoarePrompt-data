Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer. If both conditions ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) are satisfied, then `count` is incremented by 1. The `prefix_balances` remains not empty, and `b` is still the first element in `prefix_balances`. If the conditions are not met, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
