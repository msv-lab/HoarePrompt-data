According to the code, the loop will execute for values of `i` ranging from 1 to n inclusive. Before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted as follows:
State: **`s` is assigned the new value at index + 2 in the list `data`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of the count subtraction, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, `i` is 1**
