Example Answer:
The value of `count` is appended to the `results` list. The value of `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` for which `(x - b)` is divisible by `balance` and the result is greater than or equal to 0. If `prefix_balances` is an empty list, `count` will be 0. Therefore, the output state is: count elements have been appended to the results list.
Output State: **count elements have been appended to the results list**
