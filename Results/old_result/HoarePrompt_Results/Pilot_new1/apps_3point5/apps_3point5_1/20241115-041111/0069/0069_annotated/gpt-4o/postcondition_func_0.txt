The function `func_1` reads input from the standard input, processes the data based on the provided conditions, and prints the results. It iterates over a range of test cases, calculates balances, and appends results accordingly. If the balance is 0 and `x` is in the calculated prefix balances, it appends -1 to the results; otherwise, it appends 0. If the balance is not 0, it counts the occurrences that meet specific conditions and appends the count to the results. The function does not accept any parameters explicitly and does not have a return value.
