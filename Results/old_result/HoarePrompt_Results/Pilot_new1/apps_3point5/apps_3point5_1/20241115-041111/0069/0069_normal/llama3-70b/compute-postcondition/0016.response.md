Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The balance is calculated as `cnt0 - cnt1`, but the values of `cnt0` and `cnt1` are not given. Therefore, the output state is: T is greater than 1, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on input.
Output State: **T is greater than 1, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on input**
