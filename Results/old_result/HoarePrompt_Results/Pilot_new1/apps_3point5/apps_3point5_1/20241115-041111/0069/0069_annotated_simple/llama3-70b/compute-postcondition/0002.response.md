Example Answer: 
`n` and `x` are assigned values by mapping integers from the input split. The input is split by spaces, and the integers are assigned to `n` and `x`. The previous value of `T` is unknown, so the output state is: T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned input integers**
