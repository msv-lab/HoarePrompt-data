Postcondition: ***T is greater than the current value, n and x are assigned values based on input, s contains the input value, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, balance is calculated as the difference between cnt0 and cnt1. If balance equals x, then n + 1 is printed. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is printed. This encompasses all possible scenarios and outcomes of the if-else block, ensuring a comprehensive postcondition.***
