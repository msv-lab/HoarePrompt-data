Postcondition: ***`s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `n` is greater than 0, `count` is initialized to 0. The condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0) is satisfied***
