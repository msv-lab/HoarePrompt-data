Example Answer:
The list `prefix_balances` is initialized with a length of `n + 1` filled with zeros. The variables `T`, `index`, `results`, `n`, `x`, `s`, and `balance` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index position, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index + 1 position, `s` is a string value extracted from `data` at index + 2 position, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`.
Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index position, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index + 1 position, `s` is a string value extracted from `data` at index + 2 position, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`**
