Postcondition: ***If `n` is greater than 0, `prefix_balances` contains the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding element in `s` is '0' and -1 otherwise up to index `n`, and `balance` is 0. If `n` is 0 or lower, `prefix_balances` remains a list of size (n+1) filled with 0s, and `balance` is 0. After the execution of the if-else block, if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then -1 is appended to `results`. Otherwise, 0 is appended to `results`. This ensures that `results` contains the appropriate value based on the presence of `x` in `prefix_balances` and the initial conditions of `n` and `s`. If `n` is greater than 0, the loop will execute at least once and update `prefix_balances` based on the provided formula. After the loop execution, `prefix_balances` will contain the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding element in `s` is '0' and -1 otherwise up to index `n`. If `n` is 0 or lower, the loop won't execute, and `prefix_balances` will remain a list of size (n+1) filled with 0s. Additionally, `balance` is not equal to 0. The variable `count` will be incremented by 1 for each element in `prefix_balances` that satisfies the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. This ensures that `count` reflects the number of times the condition was met accurately. If the condition is not met for any element in `prefix_balances`, `count` remains unchanged. `results` will contain the updated `count` after appending it.***
