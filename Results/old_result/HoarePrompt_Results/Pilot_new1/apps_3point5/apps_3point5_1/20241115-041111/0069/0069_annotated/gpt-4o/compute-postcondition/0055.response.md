According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. Additionally, since `n` represents the total number of elements in the `data` list, it should be adjusted to be at least 4 to ensure that `i` can be incremented one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `x`, and `s` are assigned the integer values at the new indices in the `data` list, `i` is 4, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)**
