Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, the variables `s`, `index`, `balance`, `prefix_balances`, `n`, `results`, `x`, and `count` are in their updated states. If the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s` is 0 and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, -1 is appended to the `results` list. If the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s` is 0 and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, 0 is appended to the `results` list. If the cumulative balance of '0's and '1's in `s` is not 0, the `count` is updated based on the conditions described in the loop, and the final count value is appended to the `results` list. All other variables retain their initial values or are updated as described in the program fragment.***
