According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `results` list. If the list has at least 3 results, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is at least 1, `results` has at least 2 results, `balance` equals 0 after the loop, conditions for `prefix_balances`, `x` in `prefix_balances`, and `count` are met. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `results` list must have at least 3 results.
State: **If `n` is at least 1, `results` has at least 3 results, `balance` equals 0 after the loop, conditions for `prefix_balances`, `x` in `prefix_balances`, and `count` are met**
