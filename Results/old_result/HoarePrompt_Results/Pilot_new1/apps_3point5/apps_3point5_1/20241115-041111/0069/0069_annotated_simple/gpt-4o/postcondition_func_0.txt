The function `func_1` reads input data from the standard input, processes it based on certain constraints, and prints the results. It iterates over the input data to calculate balance changes and prefix balances. Depending on the balance and prefix balances, it determines the count and appends it to the results list. Finally, it prints the results. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
