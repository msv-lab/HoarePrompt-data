According to the code, the loop will execute T times. At the end of the last iteration, the values of T, n, x, s, cnt0, cnt1, and balance will be the same as the initial values. To execute the loop one more time, the value of T needs to be adjusted to T + 1.
State: **T + 1, n, x, s, cnt0, cnt1, balance**
