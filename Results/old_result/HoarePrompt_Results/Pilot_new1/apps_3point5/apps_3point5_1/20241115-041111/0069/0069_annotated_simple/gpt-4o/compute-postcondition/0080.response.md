Output State: **If n is at least 1, the loop executes and updates prefix_balances based on the calculation provided. If n is less than 1, prefix_balances remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. If balance is 0, prefix_balances is updated according to the loop calculation. If x is in prefix_balances, -1 is appended to the results list; if x is not in prefix_balances, 0 is appended. In the else part, count represents the number of elements in prefix_balances satisfying the conditions, and results list contains the appended value of count. T is greater than 1, `n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`.**
