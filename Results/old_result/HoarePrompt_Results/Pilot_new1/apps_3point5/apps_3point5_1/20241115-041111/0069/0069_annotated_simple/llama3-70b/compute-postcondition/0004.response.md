Example Answer:
The variables `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the counts of '0' and '1' in the string `s` respectively. The counts are calculated based on the input string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `s` is the input string, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in `s`**
