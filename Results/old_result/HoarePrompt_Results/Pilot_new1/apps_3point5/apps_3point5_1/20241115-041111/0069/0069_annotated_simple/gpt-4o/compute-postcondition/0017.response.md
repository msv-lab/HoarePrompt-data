Output State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index position, `x` is an integer value extracted from `data` at index + 1 position, `s` is a string value extracted from `data` at index + 2 position, `balance` is the result of counting '0's and '1's in `s`, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with length `n + 1`, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[2]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1), `prefix_balances[3]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
