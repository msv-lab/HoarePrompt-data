Postcondition: ***`s` is assigned the new value at index + 2 in the list `data`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of the count subtraction, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the condition in the loop. If n is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros. In the if part, if `balance` equals 0, and `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then -1 is appended to the `results` list. If `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then 0 is appended to the `results` list. In the else part, after the loop executes, `balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the condition ((x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0), and this count is appended to the `results` list.***
