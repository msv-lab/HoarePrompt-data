Example Answer:
`results` is initialized as an empty list. The other variables `T` and `index` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: T is assigned the value of the first element in the list `data`, which represents the number of test cases. `index` is assigned the value 1, `results` is an empty list.
Output State: **T is assigned the value of the first element in the list `data`, which represents the number of test cases. `index` is assigned the value 1, `results` is an empty list**
