According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the prefix_balances list. If the list has more elements, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` has even more elements. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the prefix_balances list must have even more elements than before.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `balance` is not equal to 0, `prefix_balances` has even more elements**
