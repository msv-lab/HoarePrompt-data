According to the code, the loop can execute if the value of T is at least 1. Before the loop starts, T is assigned the value of the first element in the list `data`, so T must be greater than or equal to 1 for the loop to execute. Additionally, since `index` is assigned the value 1 at the start, it should remain as 1. The `results` list being empty does not affect the loop execution.
State: **`T` is greater than or equal to 1, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
