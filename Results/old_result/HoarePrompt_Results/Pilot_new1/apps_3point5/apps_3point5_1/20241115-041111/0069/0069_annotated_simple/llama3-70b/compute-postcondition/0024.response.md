Postcondition: ***T, n, x are positive integers, s is a string, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, balance is cnt0 - cnt1. If balance == x, the program prints n + 1. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is printed. This postcondition covers all edge cases, including the scenario when cnt0 - cnt1 is 0.***
