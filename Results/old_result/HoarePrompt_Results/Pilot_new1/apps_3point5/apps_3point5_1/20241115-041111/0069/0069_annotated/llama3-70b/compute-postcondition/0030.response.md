Example Answer:
The code `print(n + 1)` will output the value of `n` incremented by 1. Since `n` is an input integer, the output will be the input integer incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: T + 2 is a positive integer, n is an input integer, x is an input integer, cnt0 is the count of '0' in the input string `s`, cnt1 is the count of '1' in the input string `s`, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1, `s` is an input string, cnt0 is the count of '0' in the input string `s`, cnt1 is the count of '1' in the input string `s`, and the program prints the input integer incremented by 1.
Output State: **T + 2 is a positive integer, n is an input integer, x is an input integer, cnt0 is the count of '0' in the input string `s`, cnt1 is the count of '1' in the input string `s`, balance is the result of cnt0 - cnt1, `s` is an input string, cnt0 is the count of '0' in the input string `s`, cnt1 is the count of '1' in the input string `s`, and the program prints the input integer incremented by 1**
