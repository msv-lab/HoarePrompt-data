Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the balance is zero and the desired balance is in the prefix_balances list. In this case, the program should output -1, but the program incorrectly outputs 0.

For example, consider the input:
```
1
4 0
1010
```
The expected output should be -1, as there are an infinite number of prefixes with balance equal to 0. However, the program will output 0 in this case.

Therefore, the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the Correctness **False**.
