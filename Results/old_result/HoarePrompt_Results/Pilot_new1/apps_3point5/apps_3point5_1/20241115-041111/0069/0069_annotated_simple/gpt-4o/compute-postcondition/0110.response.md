Output State: **If n is at least 1, prefix_balances is a list of zeros with a length of n + 1, balance is 0, x is in prefix_balances, count is increased by 2, results list contains the appended value of count, T is greater than 1, n is assigned the value of int(data[index]), x is assigned the value of int(data[index + 1]), s is assigned the value of data[index + 2, index is increased by 3, and prefix_balances[i] is updated based on the given formula. If (x - b) % balance equals 0 and (x - b) // balance is greater than or equal to 0, then count is increased by 1. `index` is increased by 1, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances` list.**
