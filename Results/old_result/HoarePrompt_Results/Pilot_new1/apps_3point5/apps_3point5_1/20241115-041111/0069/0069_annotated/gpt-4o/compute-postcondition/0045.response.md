Example Answer: 
`s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` of the `data` list. The values of `n` and `x` are dependent on the value at specific indices of the `data` list, which are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is assigned the integer value at index `index` of the `data` list, `x` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 1` of the `data` list, and `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` of the `data` list.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the integer value at index `index` of the `data` list, `x` is assigned the integer value at index `index + 1` of the `data` list, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` of the `data` list**
