Example Answer: 
The input is stored in variable `s`. The value of `s` is based on the input received. The values of `n` and `x` are not mentioned in the code snippet, so they remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: T is greater than 1, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on input, `s` contains the input value.
Output State: **T is greater than 1, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on input, `s` contains the input value**
