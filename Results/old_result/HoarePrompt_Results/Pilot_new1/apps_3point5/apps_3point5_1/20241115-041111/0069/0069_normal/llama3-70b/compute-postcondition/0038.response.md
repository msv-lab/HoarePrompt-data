Functionality: **The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input and then processes `T` test cases. For each test case, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, a string `s`, and calculates the counts of '0' and '1' in `s`. It then computes the balance as the difference between the counts. Depending on the balance and `x`, it prints different values. If the balance is equal to `x`, it prints `n + 1`. If `(x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)` is 0, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints `((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)`. If `T` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, resulting in no output.**
