Functionality: ** The function `func` prompts the user to input three positive integers a, b, and c. It then calculates the maximum number of lemons that can be bought based on the minimum of a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4. After that, it computes the total number of fruits by multiplying the maximum lemons by 1, 2, and 4 respectively. Finally, it prints the total number of fruits. However, the function lacks error handling for cases where the inputs are not positive integers or if the inputs are missing. **
