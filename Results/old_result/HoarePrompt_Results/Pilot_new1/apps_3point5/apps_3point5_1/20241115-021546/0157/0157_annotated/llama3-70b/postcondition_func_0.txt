The function `func` reads three integer inputs `a`, `b`, and `c` from the user. It then calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be obtained based on the ratios of a, b, and c. The function prints the total number of lemons that can be obtained by adding the minimum number of lemons required for each ingredient. The function operates under the assumption that `a`, `b`, and `c` are positive integers in the ranges 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000. The function does not explicitly return any value.
