Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. Since the range of `a` is 1 to 1000, the possible values for `a` are within that range. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000.
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000**
