Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly calculates the minimum number of lemons that can be used based on the input values of lemons, apples, and pears. It then calculates the total number of fruits that can be used to cook the compote by multiplying the minimum number of lemons by 1 (lemon ratio), 2 (apple ratio), and 4 (pear ratio). The code follows the problem description for all potential cases, as it correctly calculates the maximum total number of lemons, apples, and pears that Nikolay can use to cook the compote.
