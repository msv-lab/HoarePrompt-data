Example Answer:
`total_fruits` is calculated by multiplying `max_lemons` by 1, 2, and 4 respectively. `max_lemons` is the minimum of a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4. Therefore, the total number of fruits is calculated based on the minimum value among the divisions of a by 2, b by 2, and c by 4. No other variables are affected.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4, `total_fruits` is the total number of fruits calculated based on the minimum value among the divisions of a by 2, b by 2, and c by 4**
