Correctness: **False**

The code does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code correctly extracts the digits from the cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, and concatenates them to form a single integer. However, it does not handle the condition where Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice-versa using cube rotations. This means that the code may potentially give incorrect results in cases where there are both 6 and 9 on the cubes, as Masha should not be able to interchange them to form a larger number.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not cover all the requirements of the problem description.
