According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 4 digits, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` is a list with at least 3 digits, `digit` is the third digit in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 4 digits, and the `digit` should be the fourth digit in the list. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **At least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 4 digits, `digit` is the fourth digit in the list, `found` is False**
