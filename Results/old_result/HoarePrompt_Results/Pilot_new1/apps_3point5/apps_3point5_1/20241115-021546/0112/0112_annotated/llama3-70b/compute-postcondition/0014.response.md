Example Answer:
The code joins the digits in the 'digits' set, sorts them in descending order, and converts them into an integer. Since 'digits' is a set containing the individual digits of the last cube in the list without '0', and '0' is removed if present, the maximum possible number is formed. If 'digits' is empty, an error will occur. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of cubes with at least one cube, digits is a set containing the individual digits of the last cube in the list without '0', cube is the last cube in the list, max_num is the maximum number formed from the digits in descending order.
Output State: **n is an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, cubes is a list of cubes with at least one cube, digits is a set containing the individual digits of the last cube in the list without '0', cube is the last cube in the list, max_num is the maximum number formed from the digits in descending order**
