According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, at least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `i` is less than `n+1`, and the loop is broken. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
State: **At least one cube is marked as used in the `used_cubes` list, `digits` is a list with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `n` is greater than 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `i` is less than `n+1`, and the loop is not broken.**
