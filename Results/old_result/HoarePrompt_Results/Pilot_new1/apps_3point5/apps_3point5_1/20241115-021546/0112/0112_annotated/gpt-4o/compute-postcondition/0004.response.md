According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is a positive integer. Before the loop starts, `n` being a positive integer is sufficient for the loop to execute. Thus, no additional adjustments are needed.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements, each set to False, `digits` is a non-empty list, `found` is False**
