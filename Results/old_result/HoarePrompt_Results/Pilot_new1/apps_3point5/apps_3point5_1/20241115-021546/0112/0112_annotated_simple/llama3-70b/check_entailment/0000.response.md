Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input values for the number of cubes and the digits on each face of the cubes.
2. It then creates a set of all unique digits present on the cubes, excluding '0' if it exists.
3. The program then constructs the maximum number that can be formed by sorting the digits in descending order and joining them as a string.
4. Finally, it prints the maximum number that can be formed using the given cubes.
5. The program logic ensures that Masha can make any integers from 1 to the maximum number that can be formed with the given cubes.
6. The program handles the constraints and requirements specified in the problem description.
