According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `i` is less than `n` is met. At the end of the last iteration, the following states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time:
- `n` should be greater than the current value of `n`.
- `used_cubes[i]` should be False.
- `digit` should be in `cube_faces[i]`.

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`digits` list has at least one digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` list has at least one element which is `True`, `found` is True, `n` is greater than the current value of `n`, `used_cubes[i]` is False, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.**
