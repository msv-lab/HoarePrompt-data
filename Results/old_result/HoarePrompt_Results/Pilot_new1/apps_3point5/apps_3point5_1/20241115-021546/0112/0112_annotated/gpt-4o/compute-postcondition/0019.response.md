Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, `used_cubes` is a list of n elements where the cube at index i is marked as True if not used_cubes[i], `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, `digits` is a non-empty list, `found` is True, `i` is incremented by 2. If not used_cubes[i] and digit is in cube_faces[i], then used_cubes[i] is set to True, found is set to True, and the loop breaks. This ensures that the cube at index i is marked as used, and the item is found in the cube_faces list. All other variables retain their initial values.***
