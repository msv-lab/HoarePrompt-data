Postcondition: ***`digits` list has at least one digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` list has at least one element which is `True`, `found` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i`]. If the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is met, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop is broken. All other variables remain unchanged.***
