According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `digits` list has at least one digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` list has at least one element which is `True`, `found` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 0, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `n` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`digits` list has at least one digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `used_cubes` list has at least one element which is `True`, `found` is True, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `used_cubes[i]` is True, and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`.**
