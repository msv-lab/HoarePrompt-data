According to the code, the loop can execute as long as the alphabet is defined. Since the alphabet is typically the set of small English letters, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with length between 1 and 10^5, and `res` is an empty string. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `char` needs to iterate over each small English letter in the alphabet. 
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is an empty string, `char` iterates over each small English letter in the alphabet**
