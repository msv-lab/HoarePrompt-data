Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code iterates over the lowercase English alphabet and for each character in the alphabet, it checks if that character exists in the input string `s`. If the character is found, it appends that character to the result string `res` and replaces the character in `s` with the next character in the alphabet. The code then checks if the resulting string `res` contains all 26 lowercase English letters in order. If it does, it prints the resulting string, otherwise, it prints -1.

The code accurately follows the problem description for every potential case. It correctly handles the scenario where the input string `s` can be transformed into a string containing the English alphabet as a subsequence. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
