Example Answer: 
The character `char` is appended to the string `res`, which means the character is added at the end of the string. The previous state of `res` is the string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the character whose ASCII value is one more than `char`. Therefore, after execution, the new `res` will be the updated string after adding the current character at the end.
Output State: **`s` is the updated string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the character whose ASCII value is one more than `char`, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is the updated string after adding the current character**
