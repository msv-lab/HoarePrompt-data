Postcondition: ***If the loop completes and all characters in `s` are found in order in `target`, then `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to `target_len`, and all characters in `s` are matched with characters in `target`. If `s` contains characters not in `target`, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to `target_len`, and not all characters in `s` are matched with characters in `target`. If `s` is longer than `target`, `i` is greater than the length of `s`, and `j` is equal to `target_len` or less. If `s` is empty, `i` is 0, and `j` is equal to `target_len`***
