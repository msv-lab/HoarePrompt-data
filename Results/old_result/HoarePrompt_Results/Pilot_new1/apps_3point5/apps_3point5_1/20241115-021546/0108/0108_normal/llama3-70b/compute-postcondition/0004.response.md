Example Answer:
The value of `char` is added to the end of `res` in each iteration. As `char` iterates over each small English letter in the alphabet, `res` will contain all the small English letters in order. Since `res` starts as an empty string and each letter is appended to it, the final value of `res` will be all the small English letters in order.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with length between 1 and 10^5, `res` contains all small English letters in order, `char` iterates over each small English letter in the alphabet**
