According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the existence of the variable 'char' in 's'. If 'char' is in 's', the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, 'char' is not defined, so it needs to be adjusted to a lowercase English letter. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **If 's' contains all lowercase English letters at least once, 'res' is the concatenation of all characters iterated over in 's'. If 's' does not contain all lowercase English letters at least once, 'res' remains the same as the initial concatenation of characters in 's'. 'char' is a lowercase English letter.**
