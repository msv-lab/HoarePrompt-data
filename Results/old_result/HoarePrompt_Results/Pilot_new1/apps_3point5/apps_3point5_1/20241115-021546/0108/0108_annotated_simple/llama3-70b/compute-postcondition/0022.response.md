Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. The replacement is done only once. The value of `res` is not directly affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `res` is a string consisting of 'a's and 'b's in increasing order followed by the next character after `char`, and the next character after `char` in `res` is present in string `s`.
Output State: **`res` is a string consisting of 'a's and 'b's in increasing order followed by the next character after `char`, and the next character after `char` in `res` is present in string `s`**
