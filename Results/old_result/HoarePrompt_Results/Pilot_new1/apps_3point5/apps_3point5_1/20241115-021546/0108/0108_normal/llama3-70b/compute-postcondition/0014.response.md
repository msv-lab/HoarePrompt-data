According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `s`, `res`, and `char`. If `s` contains all small English letters in order, the loop will execute till the end of the alphabet. If not, the loop will terminate early. At the end of the last iteration, if the loop terminated early, `res` contains all small English letters up to the point where the loop terminated, and `char` is the last small English letter that was successfully processed before the loop terminated. To execute the loop one more time, `char` needs to be adjusted to the next small English letter in the alphabet.
State: **If the loop terminated early - `res` contains all small English letters up to the point where the loop terminated, `char` is the next small English letter in the alphabet. If the loop executed till the end - `res` contains all small English letters in order, `char` is the last small English letter in the alphabet.**
