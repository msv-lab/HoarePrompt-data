Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of `char` in `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. The updated `s` is then stored back in `s`. Since `s` is a string consisting of small English letters, the replacement will always result in a valid string. The `res` variable remains unaffected as it contains all small English letters in order. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet, `res` contains all small English letters in order, `char` iterates over each small English letter in the alphabet.
Output State: **`s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet, `res` contains all small English letters in order, `char` iterates over each small English letter in the alphabet**
