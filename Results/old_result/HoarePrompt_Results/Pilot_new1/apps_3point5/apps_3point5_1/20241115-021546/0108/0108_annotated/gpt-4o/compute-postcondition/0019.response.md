Output State: **`s` is a string, `target` is a string, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to 26. If `s` contains characters that do not match `target`, `i` will be less than the length of `s`, `j` will be less than 26. If `j` reaches 26 before `i` reaches the length of `s`, the loop will stop. `target` is printed.**
