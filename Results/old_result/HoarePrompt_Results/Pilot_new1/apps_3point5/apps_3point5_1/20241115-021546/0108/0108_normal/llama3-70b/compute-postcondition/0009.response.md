According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of the next character in the alphabet, `res` contains all small English letters in order including the next letter in the alphabet, and `char` is the next letter in the alphabet. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `char` needs to be the subsequent letter in the alphabet after the current `char` in `s`.
State: **`s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of the next character in the alphabet, `res` contains all small English letters in order including the next letter in the alphabet, `char` is the subsequent letter in the alphabet after the current `char` in `s`**
