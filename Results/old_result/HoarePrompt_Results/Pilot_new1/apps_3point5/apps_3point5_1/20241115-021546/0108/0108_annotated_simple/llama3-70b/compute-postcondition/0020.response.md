According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. At the end of the previous iteration, `res` is a string consisting of 'a's and 'b's in increasing order followed by the next character after `char`. For the loop to execute one more time, the next character after `char` in `res` must be present in the string `s`.
State: **`res` is a string consisting of 'a's and 'b's in increasing order followed by the next character after `char` and the next character after `char` in `res` is present in string `s`**
