`char` is added to the end of `res`, and `char` is 'a'. Therefore, after execution, `res` becomes 'a'. Other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'a', `char` is 'a'**
