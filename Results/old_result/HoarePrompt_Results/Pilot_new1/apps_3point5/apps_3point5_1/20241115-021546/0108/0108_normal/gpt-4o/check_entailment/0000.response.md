Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code reads a string `s` and checks if the characters in `s` are in alphabetical order as per the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. It iterates through both strings character by character and if all characters in `s` are found in order in `target`, it prints the target string. If `s` contains characters not in `target` or is longer than `target`, it prints -1. The code covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The output hints also agree with the code and confirm that the code is correct.
