Example Answer:
The string `char` is added to the end of the string `res`, where `char` is 'b' and `res` is 'ab'. After execution, `res` becomes 'abb'. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with the first occurrence of 'b' replaced by 'c', `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of 'b' replaced by 'c', `alphabet` is assigned the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `res` is 'abb', `char` is 'b'**
