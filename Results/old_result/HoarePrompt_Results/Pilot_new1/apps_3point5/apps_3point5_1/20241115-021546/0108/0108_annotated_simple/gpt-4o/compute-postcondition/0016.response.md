According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i`, `j`, `s`, and `target`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is less than the length of `s`, `j` is less than the length of `target`. If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` is incremented by 1 and `i` is increased by 1.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1
- If `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`, then `j` needs to be incremented by 1

No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`**
