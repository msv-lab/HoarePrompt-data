Example Answer:
If 'a' is present in 's', then `char` will be updated to 'a' and `res` will have 'a' appended to it. If 'a' is not present in 's', then `char` will remain unchanged and `res` will not be affected. Therefore, the Output State is: Based on whether 'a' is present in 's', `res` and `char` are updated accordingly for the next iteration of the loop.
Output State: **Based on whether 'a' is present in 's', `res` and `char` are updated accordingly for the next iteration of the loop**
