Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. Since `res` already consists of 'a's and 'b's in increasing order followed by the next character after `char`, the new `res` will have 'a's and 'b's in increasing order followed by the next character after `char` and the next character after `char` in `res`. 
Output State: **`res` is a string consisting of 'a's and 'b's in increasing order followed by the next character after `char` and the next character after `char` in `res` is present in string `s`**
