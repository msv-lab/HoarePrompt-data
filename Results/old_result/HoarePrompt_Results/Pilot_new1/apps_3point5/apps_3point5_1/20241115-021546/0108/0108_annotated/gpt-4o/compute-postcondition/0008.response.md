According to the code, the loop can execute again if both `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than the length of `target`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 0. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2 (incremented by 1). No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 2, `j` is an integer greater than or equal to 0**
