According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of `char` with the next character in the alphabet. This means that the current `char` might not be in the modified `s`, so `char` needs to be adjusted to the next character in the alphabet. Additionally, since `char` iterates over each small English letter in the alphabet, it needs to be adjusted to the next letter. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a modified string after replacing the first occurrence of the next character in the alphabet, `res` contains all small English letters in order, `char` is the next letter in the alphabet**
