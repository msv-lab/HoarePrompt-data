Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from the input. If `c` is equal to 0, it prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, it prints 'YES' if the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is satisfied, otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function covers scenarios where `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers, `c` is not equal to 0, and the division and modulo operations meet the specified conditions. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
