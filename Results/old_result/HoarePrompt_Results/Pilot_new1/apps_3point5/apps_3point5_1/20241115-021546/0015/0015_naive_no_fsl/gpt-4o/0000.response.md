Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the favorite number b appears in the sequence s by first checking if b is equal to the first element a, then if the difference between b and a is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements c and if the result is non-negative. If any of these conditions are met, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
