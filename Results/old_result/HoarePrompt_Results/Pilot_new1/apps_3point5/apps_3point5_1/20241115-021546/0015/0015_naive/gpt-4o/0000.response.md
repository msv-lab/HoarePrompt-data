Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If the favorite number b is equal to the first element a, then the program correctly outputs "YES".
2. If the difference c between any two neighboring elements is 0, then the program correctly outputs "NO" as there will be no progression in the sequence.
3. If the difference c is not 0, then the program checks if the difference between b and a is divisible by c and the result is non-negative. If this condition is met, then the program correctly outputs "YES" as it means b is reachable in the sequence.
4. In all other cases, where b is not reachable in the sequence, the program correctly outputs "NO".
