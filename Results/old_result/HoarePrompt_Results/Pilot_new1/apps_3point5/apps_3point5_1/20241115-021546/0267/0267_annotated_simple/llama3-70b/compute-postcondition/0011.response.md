Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The values of `n` and `k` are given as non-negative integers where `k` is greater than 1 and `n` is greater than or equal to 10 to the power of `k`. The previous values of `dp[n, k]`, `n`, and `k` are not specified, so the updated value of `dp[n, k]` is calculated based on the formula provided. 
Output State: **Updated value of dp[n, k] based on the given formula**
