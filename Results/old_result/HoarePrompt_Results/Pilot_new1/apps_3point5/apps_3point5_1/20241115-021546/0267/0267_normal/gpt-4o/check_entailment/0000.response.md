Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines two functions `func_1` and `func_2` which work together to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits.
- The `func_1` function correctly checks if the number of unique digits in a given number `n` is less than or equal to `k`.
- The `func_2` function iterates over the range `[l, r]`, applies the condition `func_1(num, k)` for each number in the range, and updates the total sum accordingly by performing `(total_sum + num) % MOD`.
- The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. It correctly calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` based on the condition that each number contains at most `k` different digits.
- The output hints do not provide any conflicting information and align with the code, reinforcing the correctness of the program.
