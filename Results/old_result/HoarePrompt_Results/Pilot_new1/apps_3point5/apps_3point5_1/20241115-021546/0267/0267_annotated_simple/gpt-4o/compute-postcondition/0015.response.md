Functionality: **The function func_2 accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l` and `r` are integers satisfying 1 <= l <= r < 10^18, and `k` is an integer satisfying 1 <= k <= 10. It iterates through the range of numbers from `l` to `r`, calls func_1(num, k) for each number in the range, and updates the total sum based on the result. If func_1(num, k) returns true for any number, the total sum is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. The final value of `total_sum` is returned after the loop execution.**
