Example Answer:
If k is equal to 1, the loop won't execute, so dp[n, k] will remain unchanged. If k is not equal to 1, dp[n, k] will be updated by taking the modulo of dp[n, k] with MOD. Therefore, the Output State is: If k is equal to 1, dp[n, k] remains unchanged. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is updated by taking the modulo with MOD.
Output State: **If k is equal to 1, dp[n, k] remains unchanged. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is updated by taking the modulo with MOD**
