Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits.
2. The function `func_1` correctly checks if a number has at most $k$ different digits.
3. The function `func_2` correctly iterates through the range of numbers from $l$ to $r$ and adds only those numbers that satisfy the condition of having at most $k$ different digits to the total sum.
4. The program then takes the modulo $998244353$ of the total sum before returning it, as required by the problem description.
5. The program correctly handles all potential cases and edge cases within the given constraints.
