According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range `[l, r]`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, `total_sum` is updated to the sum of the previous `total_sum` and `num` modulo `MOD`. The variables `l` and `r` remain less than or equal to each other, and `num` is incremented by 1. If `num` reaches `r`, then `l` is incremented by 1.

To execute the loop one more time, the next iteration should have `num` incremented by 1. If `num` reaches `r`, then `l` should be incremented by 1 and `num` should be set to the new value of `l`.

State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, `total_sum` is updated to the sum of the previous `total_sum` and `num` modulo `MOD`. The variables `l` and `r` remain less than or equal to each other. If `num` reaches `r`, then `l` is incremented by 1 and `num` is set to the new value of `l`.**
