According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` dictionary stores computed values with the updated value, `i` is 4, and the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated**
