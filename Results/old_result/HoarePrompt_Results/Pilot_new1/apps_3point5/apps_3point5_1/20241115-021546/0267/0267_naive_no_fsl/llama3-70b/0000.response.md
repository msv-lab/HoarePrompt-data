Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `count` to calculate the count of numbers from 1 to n that have at most k different digits. The main function `func_1` then calculates the sum of numbers from l to r that satisfy the condition using the `count` function. The logic in the `count` function seems correct as it handles different cases based on the value of n and k. The program correctly calculates the sum modulo 998244353 as required by the problem description. The input is also taken correctly and the output is printed in the required format. 

Overall, the program seems to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases.
