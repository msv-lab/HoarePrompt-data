Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `count`, that work together to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits. The `count` function uses dynamic programming to efficiently compute the count of valid numbers within a given range. The `func_1` function then calculates the final result by subtracting the counts of valid numbers for $l-1$ from $r$, and taking the result modulo $998244353$.

The logic in the code aligns with the problem description, and the provided annotations correctly describe the flow of the program. The code handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
