The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary used to store computed values. 

Case_1: If `k` is equal to 0, the function returns 0.

Case_2: If (n, k) is already in `dp`, the function returns the value stored in dp[n, k]. If (n, k) is not in dp and k is equal to 0, the function returns 0.

Case_3: The function returns the value stored in dp[n, k] after performing the necessary computations and modulo operation with MOD. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count` is to accept three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`, and based on the conditions described above, return the appropriate value.
