Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The initial value of `i` is 3, so the calculation is based on this value. The output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` dictionary stores computed values with the updated value, `i` is 3 and the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated accordingly.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` dictionary stores computed values with the updated value, `i` is 3, and the value of `dp[n, k]` is updated**
