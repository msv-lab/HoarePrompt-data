The function `func_1` accepts three integer parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`. It calculates the result of (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD and returns it. The function operates under the conditions that 1 <= l <= r < 10^18 and 1 <= k <= 10. The main purpose of the function is to perform the specified calculation based on the input parameters and return the result.
