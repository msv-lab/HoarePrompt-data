According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `num` is within the range `[l, r]`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD` while `l`, `r`, and `num` remain unchanged. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, there is no change in the values of `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` will be updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. 
- If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, `total_sum` will remain unchanged.
- The loop will move on to the next `num` within the range `[l, r]`.

State: **`total_sum` is updated based on the evaluation of `func_1(num, k)`, `l`, `r`, and `num` are integers.**
