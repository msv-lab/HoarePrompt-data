The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the result of the expression `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The initial value of `i` is 3, so `i - 1` equals 2. The calculation of the expression results in a new value for `dp[n, k]`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values, `i` is 3, and the updated value of `dp[n, k]`.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary to store computed values, `i` is 3, and the updated value of `dp[n, k]`**
