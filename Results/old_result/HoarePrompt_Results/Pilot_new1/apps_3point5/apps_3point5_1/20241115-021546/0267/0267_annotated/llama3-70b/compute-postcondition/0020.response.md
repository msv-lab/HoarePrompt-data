Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary to store computed values. If (n, k) is present in dp, the function returns the value stored at that key. Otherwise, the function does not modify the state of n, k, or dp. If k is equal to 0, the function returns 0. If n is less than 10 raised to the power of k, dp[n, k] is set to n. If n is greater than or equal to 10 raised to the power of k, dp[n, k] is calculated based on the given formula. If k is equal to 1, dp[n, k] remains unchanged. Otherwise, dp[n, k] is updated by taking the modulo with MOD. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment.***
