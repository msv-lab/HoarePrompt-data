Example Answer:
`total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and taking the modulo `MOD`. The value of `num` is equal to `l`, so `total_sum` is updated accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated according to the formula, `l` is the starting value, `r` is the ending value where `r` is greater than or equal to `l`, `num` is equal to `l`. The function `func_1` returns true when called with arguments `num` and `k`**
