Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input as a whole line using `input().split()` which is appropriate for handling very large integers.
2. The program correctly removes leading zeroes from the input integers.
3. It then compares the lengths of the integers and if they are equal, it compares the values of the integers to determine which one is greater.
4. The program outputs the correct symbol ("<", ">", or "=") based on the comparison.
5. The program covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, including cases where the numbers are equal, one number is greater than the other, or the lengths of the numbers differ.
