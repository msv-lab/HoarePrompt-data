Example Answer: 
The value of `b` is assigned the input value after removing any leading zeros. Since `b` is already a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, the value of `b` remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros**
