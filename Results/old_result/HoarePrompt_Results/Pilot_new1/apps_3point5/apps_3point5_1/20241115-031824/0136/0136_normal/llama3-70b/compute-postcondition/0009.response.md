Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings with leading zeros stripped, but they are not equal to each other. If the integer value represented by `a` is less than the integer value represented by `b`, then the output prints '<'. If the integer value represented by `a` is greater than or equal to the integer value represented by `b`, then the output prints '>'.***
