Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. Otherwise, the program prints '='. The length of `a` is less than or equal to the length of `b`, and `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. In case `a` and `b` are empty strings initially, they are updated to '0'.***
