Example Answer:
The input is taken and leading zeros are stripped from it, then assigned to variable `b`. As `a` is not affected by the code, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string with no leading zeros**
