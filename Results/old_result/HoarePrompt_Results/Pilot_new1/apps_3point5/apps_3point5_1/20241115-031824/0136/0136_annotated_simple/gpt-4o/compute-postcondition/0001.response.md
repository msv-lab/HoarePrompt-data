Example Answer:
The variable `a` is assigned the value of the first element of the list `data` after removing any leading zeros. The value of `data[0]` is a string, and after removing leading zeros, it remains a string. Therefore, the output state is: `data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `a` is a string with leading zeros removed.
Output State: **`data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `a` is a string with leading zeros removed**
