Example Answer:
The value at index 1 of the list `data` is accessed and leading zeros are removed using `lstrip('0')`, and the resulting string is assigned to variable `b`. The initial state shows that `data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, and `a` is a string with leading zeros removed. After execution, the output state is: `data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `a` is a string with leading zeros removed, `b` is a string with leading zeros removed from the element at index 1 of `data`.
Output State: **`data` is a list containing the input split by spaces, `a` is a string with leading zeros removed, `b` is a string with leading zeros removed from the element at index 1 of `data`**
