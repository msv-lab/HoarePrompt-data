Postcondition: ***`data` is a list containing input split by spaces, `a` is a string with leading zeros removed, `b` is a string with leading zeros removed from the element at index 1 of `data`. If `a` is an empty string, it is updated to '0'. If the element at index 1 of `data` is an empty string, `b` is updated to '0'. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, `a` is greater than or equal to `b`, and `a` is greater than `b`***
