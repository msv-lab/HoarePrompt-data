Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. It calculates the probability using the formula (total_days - 1) * (total_days - 2) * ... * (total_days - k + 1) / total_days^k. The program then reduces the fraction to its irreducible form by finding the greatest common divisor and then takes the remainder modulo 10^6 + 3. 
The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that the output is correct for any valid input values of n and k.
