According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, total_days is 2 raised to the power of n, so n must be a non-negative integer to ensure total_days is a valid value. The numerator and denominator are set to 1, which does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, `n` must be a non-negative integer, `k` must be greater than 0, and `i` is 0.
State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
