According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is the updated value after the calculation, `denominator` is the updated value after the calculation, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0, and `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days` modulo `MOD**.
