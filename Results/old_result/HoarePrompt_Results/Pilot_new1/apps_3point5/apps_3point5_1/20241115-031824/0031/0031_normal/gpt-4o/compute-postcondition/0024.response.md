Example Answer: 
`g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`, where `A` is the value of `p_shared` and `B` is the value of `p_total`. The previous values of `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, `A`, and `B` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_no_shared` is either calculated based on the formula or remains 1, `p_total` is assigned the value of the denominator, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(A, B)`.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is either calculated based on the formula or remains 1, `p_total` is assigned the value of the denominator, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `g` is assigned the value returned by `func_1(A, B)**
