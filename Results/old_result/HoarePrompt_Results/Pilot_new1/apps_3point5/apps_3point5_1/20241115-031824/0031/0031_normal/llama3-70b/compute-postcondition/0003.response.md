According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than or equal to 1. Since k has a minimum value of 2, the loop will always execute. Before the loop starts, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, so n needs to be defined. Additionally, since the loop iterates over the range of k, i should be set to 0 at the start of the loop.
State: **n is defined, total_days is calculated based on the value of n, numerator is 1, denominator is 1, i is 0**
