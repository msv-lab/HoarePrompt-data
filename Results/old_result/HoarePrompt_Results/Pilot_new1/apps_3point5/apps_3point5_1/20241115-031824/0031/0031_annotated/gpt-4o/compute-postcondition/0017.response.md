According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3.
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 << n, `numerator` is updated, `denominator` is updated, `i` is 3, `k` is greater than 0, `numerator` is multiplied by (total_days - i) modulo MOD, `denominator` is updated**
