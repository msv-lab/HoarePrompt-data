The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n`, the program prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, it calculates and prints the values of `A` and `B` based on certain calculations involving `n` and `k`. The functionality does not cover the case where `k` is less than or equal to 1 shifted left by `n`, and it does not handle potential errors or edge cases that might arise.
