Example Answer:
`total_days` is assigned the value of `2 ** n`, where `n` is an integer. The value of `n` can be between 1 and 10^18, so `total_days` will be calculated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; total_days is calculated based on the value of n.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18; total_days is calculated based on the value of n**
