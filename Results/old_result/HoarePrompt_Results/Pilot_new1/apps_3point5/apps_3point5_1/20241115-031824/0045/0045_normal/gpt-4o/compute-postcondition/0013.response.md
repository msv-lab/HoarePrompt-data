According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 1`, so for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `k - 2`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `sequence` is a list containing the values of d * (i + 1) for i ranging from 0 to k-1 with the last element incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 2`, and `remainder` is equal to -1**
