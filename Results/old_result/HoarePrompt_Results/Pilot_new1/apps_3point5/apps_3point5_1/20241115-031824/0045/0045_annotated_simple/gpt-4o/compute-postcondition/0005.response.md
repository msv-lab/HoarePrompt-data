Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`. The variables `n`, `k`, and `min_sum` are not directly affected by this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is calculated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is calculated based on the formula provided**
