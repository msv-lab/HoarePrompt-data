Example Answer:
`remainder` and `k` are both decreased by 1. The value of `remainder` is decreased by 1, and if it becomes 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. The value of `sequence[i]` is not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `remainder` and `k` are both decreased by 1, and the program may break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
Output State: **`remainder` and `k` are both decreased by 1, and the program may break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
