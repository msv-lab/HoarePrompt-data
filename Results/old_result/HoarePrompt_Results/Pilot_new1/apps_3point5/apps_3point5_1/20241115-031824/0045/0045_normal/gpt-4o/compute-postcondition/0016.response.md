Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers. `sequence` is a list containing the values of d * (i + 1) for i ranging from 0 to k-1 with the last element incremented by 1. `i` is `k - 2`, and `remainder` is initially -1. If `remainder` is equal to 0, the loop breaks. Otherwise, the program continues with the same initial state where the value at index `i` in `sequence` is incremented by 1.**
