Example Answer: 
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The new values of `a` and `b` should be such that `b` is still truthy. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` and `b` have new values where `b` is still truthy.
Output State: **`a` and `b` have new values where `b` is still truthy**
