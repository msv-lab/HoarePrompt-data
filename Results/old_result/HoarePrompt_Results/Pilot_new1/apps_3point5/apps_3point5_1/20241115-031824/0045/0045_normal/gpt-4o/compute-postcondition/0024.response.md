Output State: **If remainder is 0, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, the loop increments the last element of the sequence list by 1 and decrements the remainder by 1 until the remainder reaches 0. After the loop executes, `n` and `k` remain positive integers, `sequence` contains the values of d * (i + 1) for i ranging from 0 to k-1 with the last element incremented by 1, `i` is `k - x` where x is the number of times the loop executed, and `remainder` is 0.**
