Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts two positive integers a and b, and calculates the greatest common divisor of the initial values of a and b using the Euclidean algorithm. If b is 0, the function returns a. If b is 1, a becomes 0 and b becomes 1. For all other cases, the function iterates until b becomes 0, and a holds the greatest common divisor.**
