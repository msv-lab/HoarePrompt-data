Output State: **If remainder is greater than 0, the loop will execute k times, decrementing remainder by 1 each time. After the loop executes, `n`, `k`, and `min_sum` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10, and `min_sum` is calculated based on the formula. If remainder is 0, the loop may break early, and the values of `remainder`, `k`, and `sequence` will be updated accordingly. If remainder is negative or 0 initially, the loop does not execute and all variables retain their initial conditions and constraints.**
