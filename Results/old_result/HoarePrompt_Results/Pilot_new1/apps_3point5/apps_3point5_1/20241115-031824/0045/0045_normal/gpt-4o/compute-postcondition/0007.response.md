According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `k` is a positive integer. The loop iterates from `k - 1` down to `0`. At the start of the loop, the values of `i` and `k` are crucial. Therefore, before the loop starts, the states need to be adjusted to `n` and `k` are positive integers, `sequence` is a list containing the values of d * (i + 1) for i ranging from 0 to k-1, and `i` is `k - 1`. 
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `sequence` is a list containing the values of d * (i + 1) for i ranging from 0 to k-1, `i` is `k - 1`**
