Example Answer: 
A list `sequence` is created by iterating over a range of `k` and calculating each element as `d * (i + 1)`, where `d` is the value of the current iteration and `i` is the index. The previous values of `n` and `k` are not used in this calculation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is calculated based on the formula provided.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10; `min_sum` is calculated based on the formula provided**
