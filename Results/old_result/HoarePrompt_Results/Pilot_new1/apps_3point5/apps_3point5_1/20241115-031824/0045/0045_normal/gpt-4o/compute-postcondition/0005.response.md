Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated by subtracting `d` multiplied by `min_sum` from `n`. The values of `n`, `k`, and `min_sum` are not provided, so the final value of `remainder` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, and the program either returns -1 or `d` is calculated based on the value of `min_sum`.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, and the program either returns -1 or `d` is calculated based on the value of `min_sum`**
