According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `b` evaluates to True. At the end of the previous iteration, `a` and `b` have been updated based on the previous values, and `b` evaluates to True. To ensure the loop executes one more time, no adjustments need to be made to the current state as `b` already evaluates to True.
State: **`a` and `b` have been updated based on the previous values, and `b` evaluates to True**
