Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly implements the logic to find a strictly increasing sequence of k positive numbers that sum up to n and have the maximum greatest common divisor. It calculates the minimum possible sum of k positive numbers (min_sum) and checks if it exceeds n, in which case it returns -1. It then calculates the common divisor d and the remainder, and constructs the sequence accordingly. The program also handles the case where there is no possible sequence by returning -1. The program seems to cover all potential cases and works as expected based on the problem description.
