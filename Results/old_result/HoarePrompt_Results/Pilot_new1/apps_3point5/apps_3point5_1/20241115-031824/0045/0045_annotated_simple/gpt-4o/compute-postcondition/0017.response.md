Example Answer: 
The value of `remainder` is decreased by 1. The previous value of `remainder` is unknown, so after execution, the new value of `remainder` will be 1 less than its previous value. Therefore, the Output State is: `remainder` is decreased by 1.
Output State: **`remainder` is decreased by 1**
