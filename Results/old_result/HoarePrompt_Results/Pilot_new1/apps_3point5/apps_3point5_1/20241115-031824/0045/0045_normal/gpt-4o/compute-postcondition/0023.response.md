According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k - 3` and has been decremented by 1. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be `k - 4`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers, `sequence` is a list containing the values of d * (i + 1) for i ranging from 0 to k-1 with the last element incremented by 1, `i` is `k - 4`, `remainder` is a value other than 0 and has been decremented by 1**
