According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is greater than or equal to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k`, `min_sum` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10, and `min_sum` is calculated based on the formula. `i` is `k - 1`. If the remainder is equal to 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be adjusted to `k - 2` because the loop decrements by 1 in each iteration.
State: **`n`, `k`, `min_sum` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^10, 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^10, and `min_sum` is calculated based on the formula. `i` is `k - 2`**
