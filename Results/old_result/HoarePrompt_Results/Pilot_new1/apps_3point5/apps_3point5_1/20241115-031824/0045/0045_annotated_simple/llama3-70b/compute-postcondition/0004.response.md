Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `b` evaluates to True, it has a value of 1. Therefore, `a` is updated to the remainder of the previous `a` divided by 1, which is 0. The new values of `a` and `b` are `a` is 0, `b` is 1.
Output State: **`a` is 0, `b` is 1**
