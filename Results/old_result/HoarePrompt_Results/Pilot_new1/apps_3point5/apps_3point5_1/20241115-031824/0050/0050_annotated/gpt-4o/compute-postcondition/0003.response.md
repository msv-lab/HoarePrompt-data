Example Answer:
`min_buy_price` is assigned the minimum value from the list `s`. The previous values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `b` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers created by mapping input to integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers obtained from input, `b` is a list of integers created by mapping input to integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value from list `s`**
