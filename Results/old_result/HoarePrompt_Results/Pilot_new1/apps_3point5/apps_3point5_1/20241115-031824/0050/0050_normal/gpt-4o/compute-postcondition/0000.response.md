Example Answer: 
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values returned by `map(int, input().split())`, where the input is split by spaces, converted to integers, and assigned to `n`, `m`, and `r`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints**
