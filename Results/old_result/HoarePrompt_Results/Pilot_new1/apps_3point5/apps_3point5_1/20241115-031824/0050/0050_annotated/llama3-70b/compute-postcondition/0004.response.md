Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in descending order using the `sort` method with `reverse=True`. The previous values of the list `b` are unknown, but after sorting, the list `b` is now sorted in descending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list containing sorted integers in descending order.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a list containing sorted integers in descending order**
