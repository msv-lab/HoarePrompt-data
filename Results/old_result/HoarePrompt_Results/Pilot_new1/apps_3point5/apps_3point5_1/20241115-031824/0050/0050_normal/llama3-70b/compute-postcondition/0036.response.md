Postcondition: ***`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, `i` is 1. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. Otherwise, if shares is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
