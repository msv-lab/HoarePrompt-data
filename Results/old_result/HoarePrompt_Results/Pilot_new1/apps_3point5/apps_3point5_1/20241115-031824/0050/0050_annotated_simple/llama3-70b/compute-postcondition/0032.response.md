According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is at least 1, `b` is not empty, `r` is positive and not less than the first element of `s`, `shares` is 0, `i` and `n` retain their initial values. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`m` is at least 1, `b` is not empty, `r` is positive and not less than the first element of `s`, `shares` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` retains its initial value**
