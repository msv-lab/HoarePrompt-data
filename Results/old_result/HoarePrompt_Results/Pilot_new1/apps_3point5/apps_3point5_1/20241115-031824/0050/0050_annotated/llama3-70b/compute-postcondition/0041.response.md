Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is at least 1, `r` is updated based on shares and elements of list `b`, `b` is a list containing sorted integers in descending order, `shares` is reset to 0 if shares > 0, `i` is incremented to the next value. If shares > 0, `r` is increased by shares times the value at index `i` of list `b` and shares is reset to 0. Otherwise, the program breaks out of the loop.***
