According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, `i` is 2. Since `m` is greater than or equal to 1 and `i` is 2, the loop can execute again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`m` is greater than or equal to 1, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, `i` is 3**
