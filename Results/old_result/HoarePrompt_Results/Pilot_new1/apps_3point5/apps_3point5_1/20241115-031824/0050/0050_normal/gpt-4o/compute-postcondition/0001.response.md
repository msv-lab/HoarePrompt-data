Example Answer:
The list `s` is assigned the values entered by the user after converting them to integers using `map(int, input().split())`. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, and `s` is a list containing the integers entered by the user.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, and `s` is a list containing the integers entered by the user**
