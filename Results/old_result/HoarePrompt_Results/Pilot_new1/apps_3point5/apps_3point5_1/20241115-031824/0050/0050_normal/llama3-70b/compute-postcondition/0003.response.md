Example Answer:
The list `s` is sorted in ascending order. The previous values of the list `s` are unknown, but after sorting, the list `s` will be in ascending order. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `s_i` and `b_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= `s_i`, `b_i` <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `s_i` and `b_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= `s_i`, `b_i` <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input**
