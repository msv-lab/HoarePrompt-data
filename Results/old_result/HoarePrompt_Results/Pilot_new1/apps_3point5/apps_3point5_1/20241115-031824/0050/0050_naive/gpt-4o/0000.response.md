Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly calculates the maximum number of bourles you can hold after the evening based on the provided inputs. It considers the minimum buy price and the maximum sell price to determine the optimal strategy. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it simply prints the bourles you already have. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with the bourles you have, and then calculates the total bourles after selling those shares at the maximum sell price. The logic seems sound and covers the scenarios mentioned in the problem description.
