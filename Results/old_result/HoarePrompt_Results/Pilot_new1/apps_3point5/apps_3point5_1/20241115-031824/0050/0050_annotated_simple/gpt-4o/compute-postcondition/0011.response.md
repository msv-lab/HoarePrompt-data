Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000; `s` is a list containing integers obtained from input; `b` is a list of integers obtained from input after splitting; `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`; `max_shares` is the result of integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`; `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`. The code prints the value of `total_bourles`.**
