Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem description. It calculates the minimum buy price and maximum sell price, then determines whether to print the initial investment `r` or calculate the total amount of money earned from buying and selling shares. The code handles all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description, such as buying shares at a lower price and selling them at a higher price, or not taking any action if selling price is less than or equal to the buying price. Additionally, the output hints agree with the code and provide a clear summary of the code's functionality.
