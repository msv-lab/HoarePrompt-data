According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `n` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, the only state that needs to be adjusted is `i` which should be set to 0.
State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `s_i` and `b_i` are positive integers such that 1 <= `s_i`, `b_i` <= 1000, `s` is a list containing integers in ascending order, `b` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input sorted in descending order, `shares` is 0, `i` is 0**
