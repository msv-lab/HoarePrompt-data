Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers from the user input, calculates the absolute difference between them, and prints the result. This aligns with the problem description where Memory needs to find the minimum number of seconds required to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y starting from x. The code simply calculates the difference between x and y, which represents the minimum number of seconds needed to reach the desired side length. 

Additionally, the provided examples are valid and showcase the correct output based on the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
