Example Answer:
`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, and since `x` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100, the value of `min_upvotes` will also be a non-negative integer between 0 and 100. The states of `y` and `z` are not affected by this code snippet.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100**
