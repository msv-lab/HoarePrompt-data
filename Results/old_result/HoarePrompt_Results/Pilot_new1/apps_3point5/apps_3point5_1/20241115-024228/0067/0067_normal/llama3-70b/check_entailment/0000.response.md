Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description for all potential cases. 
- If x is greater than y + z, it prints '+', which indicates more upvotes.
- If x is less than y, it prints '-', which indicates more downvotes.
- If x equals y and z equals 0, it prints '0', which indicates an equal number of upvotes and downvotes.
- If x equals y and z is not 0, it prints '?', which indicates an uncertain result due to the unknown votes.
- If none of the above conditions are met, it prints '?', which covers all other cases where the result is uncertain due to the unknown votes.
Therefore, the code seems to be correct as it covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
