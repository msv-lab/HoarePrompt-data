Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description and logic provided. It considers all possible cases where the result could be "+", "-", or "?". The program calculates the minimum and maximum number of upvotes and downvotes based on the given input values of x, y, and z. Then, it checks if the result is certain by comparing the maximum upvotes with the minimum downvotes and vice versa. If neither condition is met, it prints "?", indicating an uncertain result. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
