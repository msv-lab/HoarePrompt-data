Postcondition: ***x, y, z are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The value of x is less than or equal to y + z. x is greater than or equal to y. If x is equal to y and z is 0, then the program prints '0'. If x is equal to y and z is not 0, then the program prints '?'. If x is not equal to y, the program prints '?'.***
