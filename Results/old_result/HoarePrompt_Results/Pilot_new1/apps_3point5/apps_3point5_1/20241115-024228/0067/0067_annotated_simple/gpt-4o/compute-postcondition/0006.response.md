Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`; `min_downvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_downvotes` is the sum of `y` and `z`; `max_upvotes` is less than `min_downvotes`**
