Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting them to integers; `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`; `max_upvotes` is equal to `min_upvotes + z`; `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`; `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. The condition (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) is false, meaning max_upvotes is greater than or equal to min_downvotes.***
