Example Answer:
`min_downvotes` is assigned the value `y`, where `y` is a non-negative integer. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `z` is a non-negative integer, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`.
Output State: **`x` is a non-negative integer, `y` is a non-negative integer, `z` is a non-negative integer, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`**
