Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers where 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. If x is equal to y and z is 0, the program prints '0'. If x is equal to y and z is not 0, the program prints '?'. If x is not equal to y, the program prints '?'. The condition x is not greater than y + z is satisfied. x is greater than or equal to y.***
