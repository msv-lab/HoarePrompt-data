Example Answer:
`min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, which is obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting it to an integer. The values of `y` and `z` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting them to integers; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string by spaces and converting them to integers; `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`**
