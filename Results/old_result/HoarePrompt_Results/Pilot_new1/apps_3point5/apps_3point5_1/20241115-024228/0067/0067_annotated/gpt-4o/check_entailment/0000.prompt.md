You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Nauuo is a girl who loves writing comments.

One day, she posted a comment on Codeforces, wondering whether she would get upvotes or downvotes.

It's known that there were $x$ persons who would upvote, $y$ persons who would downvote, and there were also another $z$ persons who would vote, but you don't know whether they would upvote or downvote. Note that each of the $x+y+z$ people would vote exactly one time.

There are three different results: if there are more people upvote than downvote, the result will be "+"; if there are more people downvote than upvote, the result will be "-"; otherwise the result will be "0".

Because of the $z$ unknown persons, the result may be uncertain (i.e. there are more than one possible results). More formally, the result is uncertain if and only if there exist two different situations of how the $z$ persons vote, that the results are different in the two situations.

Tell Nauuo the result or report that the result is uncertain.


-----Input-----

The only line contains three integers $x$, $y$, $z$ ($0\le x,y,z\le100$), corresponding to the number of persons who would upvote, downvote or unknown.


-----Output-----

If there is only one possible result, print the result : "+", "-" or "0".

Otherwise, print "?" to report that the result is uncertain.


-----Examples-----
Input
3 7 0

Output
-
Input
2 0 1

Output
+
Input
1 1 0

Output
0
Input
0 0 1

Output
?


-----Note-----

In the first example, Nauuo would definitely get three upvotes and seven downvotes, so the only possible result is "-".

In the second example, no matter the person unknown downvotes or upvotes, Nauuo would get more upvotes than downvotes. So the only possible result is "+".

In the third example, Nauuo would definitely get one upvote and one downvote, so the only possible result is "0".

In the fourth example, if the only one person upvoted, the result would be "+", otherwise, the result would be "-". There are two possible results, so the result is uncertain.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    x, y, z = map(int, input().split())
    min_upvotes = x
    max_upvotes = x + z
    min_downvotes = y
    max_downvotes = y + z
    if (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) :
        print('-')
    else :
        if (max_downvotes < min_upvotes) :
            print('+')
        else :
            print('?')
        #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces. `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `min_upvotes + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. The condition (max_upvotes < min_downvotes) is false, indicating that max_upvotes is greater than or equal to min_downvotes. Additionally, the condition (max_downvotes < min_upvotes) is false, meaning max_downvotes is greater than or equal to min_upvotes. After the execution of the if else block, the program will either print a plus sign if max_downvotes is less than min_upvotes, or a question mark if max_downvotes is greater than or equal to min_upvotes.
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *`x`, `y`, and `z` are integers obtained from splitting the input string by spaces. `min_upvotes` is equal to `x`, `max_upvotes` is equal to `min_upvotes + z`, `min_downvotes` is equal to `y`, and `max_downvotes` is equal to `y + z`. The program will either print a plus sign if max_downvotes is less than min_upvotes, or a question mark if max_downvotes is greater than or equal to min_upvotes. The conditions for the if and elif parts are explicitly covered, ensuring that all possible cases are accounted for, including edge cases where the values are equal or when the difference between max_upvotes and min_downvotes is minimal.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function reads three integers from the input, calculates various upvote and downvote ranges based on these integers, and then determines whether to print a plus sign, a question mark, or a minus sign based on the relationships between these ranges. The function handles cases where the upvote and downvote ranges overlap, are equal, or have a minimal difference. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.

I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
