Example Answer:
The code snippet prints the value of `n`. Since `n` is a non-negative integer divisible by 10, the possible values of `n` are 0, 10, 20, 30, ..., 10^9. Therefore, the output state is `n` is a non-negative integer divisible by 10.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer divisible by 10**
