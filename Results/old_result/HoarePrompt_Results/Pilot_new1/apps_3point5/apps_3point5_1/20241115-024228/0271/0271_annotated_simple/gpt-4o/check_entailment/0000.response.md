Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes an integer input `n` and calculates the nearest integer that ends with 0 by considering the remainder when `n` is divided by 10. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it subtracts the remainder from `n` to get the result. If the remainder is between 6 and 9, it adds the difference between 10 and the remainder to `n` to get the result. This logic correctly rounds the input number to the nearest integer that ends with 0 as described in the problem statement. The program covers all potential cases and provides the correct output.
