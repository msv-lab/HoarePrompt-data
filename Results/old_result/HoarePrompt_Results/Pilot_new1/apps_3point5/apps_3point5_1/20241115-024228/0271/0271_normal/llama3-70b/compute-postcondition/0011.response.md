Functionality: ** The function reads an integer n from the user input and then based on the last digit of n, it performs different operations. If n is divisible by 10, it prints n. If the last digit of n is less than or equal to 5, it prints n minus the last digit of n. If the last digit of n is greater than 5, it prints n plus the difference between 10 and the last digit of n. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value. **
