Example Answer:
The code prints the value of `n`, which is a non-negative integer divisible by 10. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a non-negative integer divisible by 10, the output will be the value of `n` itself, which is divisible by 10.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer divisible by 10**
