Postcondition: ***n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is between 0 and 9. If remainder <= 5, result is equal to n - remainder. If remainder is greater than 5, result is equal to n + (10 - remainder). This covers all possible scenarios for the values of n and remainder within the specified ranges.***
