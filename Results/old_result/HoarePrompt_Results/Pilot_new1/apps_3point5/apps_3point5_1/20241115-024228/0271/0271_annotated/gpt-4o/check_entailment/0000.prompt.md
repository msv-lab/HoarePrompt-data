You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: Vasya has a non-negative integer n. He wants to round it to nearest integer, which ends up with 0. If n already ends up with 0, Vasya considers it already rounded.

For example, if n = 4722 answer is 4720. If n = 5 Vasya can round it to 0 or to 10. Both ways are correct.

For given n find out to which integer will Vasya round it.


-----Input-----

The first line contains single integer n (0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9) — number that Vasya has.


-----Output-----

Print result of rounding n. Pay attention that in some cases answer isn't unique. In that case print any correct answer.


-----Examples-----
Input
5

Output
0

Input
113

Output
110

Input
1000000000

Output
1000000000

Input
5432359

Output
5432360



-----Note-----

In the first example n = 5. Nearest integers, that ends up with zero are 0 and 10. Any of these answers is correct, so you can print 0 or 10.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    n = int(input())
    remainder = n % 10
    if (remainder <= 5) :
        result = n - remainder
    else :
        result = n + (10 - remainder)
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is between 0 and 9. If remainder <= 5, result is equal to n - remainder. If remainder is greater than 5, result is equal to n + (10 - remainder). This covers all possible scenarios for the values of n and remainder within the specified ranges.
    print(result)
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, computes a result. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is `n - remainder`, otherwise, the result is `n + (10 - remainder)`. The function then prints the calculated result. The function does not accept any parameters and operates solely based on user input.
```


I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
