According to the code, the loop can execute if `chars` is not empty since it is used in the `permutations` function. The loop will execute for each permutation of the characters in `chars`. Before the loop starts, `chars` is a string of digits and `sub` is a string of digits. For the loop to execute, `chars` should not be empty, and `perm` should be the first permutation of the characters in `chars`.
State: **`chars` is a string of digits and not empty, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the first permutation of the characters in `chars`**
