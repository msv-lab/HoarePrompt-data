According to the code, the loop will iterate over each character in string `s`. The loop can execute as long as `s` is not an empty string. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string does not guarantee that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is not an empty string. Additionally, since `t_set` contains the unique elements of string `t`, it is not directly related to the loop execution. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `s` is not an empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, and `n` is an empty string.
State: **`s` is not an empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the unique elements of string `t`, `n` is an empty string**
