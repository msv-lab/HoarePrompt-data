According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more permutations of the characters in `chars` to generate. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the next possible combination of digits. For the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation of characters in `chars` needs to be generated. Therefore, the state of `chars` needs to be adjusted to reflect the next permutation. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the next possible combination of digits**
