Postcondition: ***`candidate` is a string resulting from joining permutations of characters in the next permutation of `chars`. If `candidate` passes the validation check with respect to `sub` using the function `is_valid_number`, then `candidate` is yielded. Otherwise, there are no further changes to the state of the program variables.***
