According to the code, the loop will execute until all characters in string `s` have been iterated. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string representing a very large integer with more characters left, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string with the updated value after concatenation if `c` is in `t_set`, `c` is the character after `n` in string `s`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` in string `s` needs to be considered. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` should be concatenated with `c`. Otherwise, no changes need to be made to the state variables.
State: **`s` is a string representing a very large integer with more characters left, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string with the updated value after concatenation if `c` is in `t_set`, `c` is the character after `n` in string `s`**
