Postcondition: ***`s` is a string representing a very large integer and not empty with more characters to iterate, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from `t`, `n` is a string with the first character of `s` concatenated with the next character in `s` to be processed. If the next character in `s` to be processed is in `t_set`, it is added to `n`. The postcondition covers all cases including when the next character is not in `t_set`.***
