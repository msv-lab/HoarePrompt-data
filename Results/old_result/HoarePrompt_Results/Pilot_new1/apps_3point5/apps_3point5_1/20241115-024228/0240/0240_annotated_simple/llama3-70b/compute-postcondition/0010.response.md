Example Answer:
The value of `n` is concatenated with the value of `c`. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` will be updated with the concatenation. Otherwise, there will be no change in the state of the variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string representing a very large integer with more characters left, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string with the updated value after concatenation, `c` is the character after `n` in string `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string representing a very large integer with more characters left, `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters from string `t`, `n` is a string with the updated value after concatenation, `c` is the character after `n` in string `s`**
