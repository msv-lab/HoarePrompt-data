Example Answer:
The generator yields the `candidate`, which is the next possible combination of digits. The initial state variables `chars`, `sub`, `perm` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of characters in `chars`, and the generator yields the `candidate`.
Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of characters in `chars`, and the generator yields the `candidate`**
