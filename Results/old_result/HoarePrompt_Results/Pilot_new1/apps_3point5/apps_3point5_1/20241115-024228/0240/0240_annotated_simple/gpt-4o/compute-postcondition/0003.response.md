Example Answer:
The `yield` statement returns the value of `candidate`, which is a string formed by joining all permutations of `perm`, and `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`. The state of other variables is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of `perm`, and `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`.
Output State: **`candidate` is a string formed by joining all permutations of `perm`, and `candidate` is a valid number with respect to `sub`**
