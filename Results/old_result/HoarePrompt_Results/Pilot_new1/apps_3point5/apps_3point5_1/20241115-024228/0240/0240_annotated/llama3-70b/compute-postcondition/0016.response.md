The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `t`. `s` is a string representing a very large integer, and `t` is a string representing a non-empty substring of `n`. After processing all characters in `s` based on the characters in `t`, the function returns the integer value of the resulting string 'n'. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two strings `s` and `t`, process `s` based on `t`, and return the integer value of the resulting string 'n'.
