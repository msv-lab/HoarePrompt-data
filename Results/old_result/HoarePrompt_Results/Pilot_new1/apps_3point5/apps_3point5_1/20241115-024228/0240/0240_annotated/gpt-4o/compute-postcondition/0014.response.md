Output State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a string of digits. The loop generates permutations of `chars` and forms a `candidate` by joining each permutation. If `candidate` passes the validity check with `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, it is yielded. If `chars` is empty, the loop does not execute, and no candidates are yielded.**
