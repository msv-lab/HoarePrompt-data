According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more permutations of the characters in `chars`. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the next possible combination of digits. To execute the loop one more time, the next permutation `perm` should be calculated. 
State: **`chars` is a non-empty string of digits, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the next possible combination of digits**
