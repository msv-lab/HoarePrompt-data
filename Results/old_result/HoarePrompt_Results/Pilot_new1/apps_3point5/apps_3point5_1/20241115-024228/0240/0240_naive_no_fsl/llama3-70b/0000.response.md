Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes in a string `s` and a substring `t`, then iterates through the characters in `s` and appends only those characters that are present in `t` to form the integer `n`. Finally, it appends the substring `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of `n`. This logic seems to correctly implement the problem description as it reconstructs the smallest possible initial integer `n` based on the given input. The program handles the case where `n` could be zero and contains leading zeroes appropriately.
