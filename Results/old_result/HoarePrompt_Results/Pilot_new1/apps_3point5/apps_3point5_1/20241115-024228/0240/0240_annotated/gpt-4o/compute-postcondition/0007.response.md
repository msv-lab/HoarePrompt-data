Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the value of `candidate`. The variables `chars`, `sub`, `perm`, and `candidate` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string of digits and not empty, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, and `candidate` is the next possible combination of digits.
Output State: **`chars` is a string of digits and not empty, `sub` is a string of digits, `perm` is the next permutation of the characters in `chars`, `candidate` is the next possible combination of digits**
