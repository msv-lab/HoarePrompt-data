Functionality: **The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `t`. It processes the characters in `s` based on the characters in `t_set`, which is a set containing unique characters from `t`. The function then concatenates the characters from `s` that are also in `t` to form a new string `n`. Finally, it returns the integer value of the resulting string 'n'. The function might not handle cases where `t_set` is empty, potentially leading to unexpected results if `t` is empty or contains duplicate characters.**
