According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the relationship between `current_counts` and `desired_counts` for each color. If for any color the count in `current_counts` is less than the count in `desired_counts`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, there exists at least one color where the count in `current_counts` is less than the count in `desired_counts`. Therefore, no states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.

State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping each color to its desired count; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0 where the count of `colors[right]` is incremented by 1; `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, and there exists at least one color where the count in `current_counts` is less than the count in `desired_counts`**
