Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary containing the count of colors encountered, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to the current iteration index. If all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `colors` is an empty list or `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop will not execute, and `window_counts` will remain an empty dictionary, `found` will be False, and `i` will be equal to `n`. If `found` is True, the loop breaks and `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `found` is True, and `i` is equal to `n`.***
