Postcondition: ***`window_counts` is a dictionary with an incremented value for the `color` key, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i+1`, `color` is assigned a value from `colors` at index `j`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0, and the value of `color` in `window_counts` is incremented by 1. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`, then `found` is True and the loop is exited.***
