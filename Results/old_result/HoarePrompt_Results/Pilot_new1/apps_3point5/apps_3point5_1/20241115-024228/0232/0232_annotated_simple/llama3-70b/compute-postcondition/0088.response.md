According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least equal to i, the loop can execute. Since `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the loop to execute are `i` is less than or equal to `n` and `j` is equal to `i`.
State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to `i`**
