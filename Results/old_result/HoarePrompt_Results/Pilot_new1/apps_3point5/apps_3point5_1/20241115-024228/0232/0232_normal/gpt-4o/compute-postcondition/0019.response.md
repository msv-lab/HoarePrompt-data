Output State: **If all colors in `desired_counts` have their counts matching the counts in `current_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the count of at least one color in `current_counts` is less than the count in `desired_counts'. `right` is less than `n`, and the count of the color at index `colors[right]` in `current_counts` is incremented by 1.**
