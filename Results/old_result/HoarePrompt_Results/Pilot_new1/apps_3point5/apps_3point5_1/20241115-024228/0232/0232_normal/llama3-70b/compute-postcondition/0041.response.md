Output State: **`found` is a boolean variable that is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts`, `color_counts` contains the count of each color in the colors list, `n` is a positive integer, `m` is a positive integer where 1 <= m <= n, `i` is 0, `window_counts` is a dictionary that contains the color `color` with a count of 1, `j` is equal to `i` + 1, `color` is assigned the value of colors[j], `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
