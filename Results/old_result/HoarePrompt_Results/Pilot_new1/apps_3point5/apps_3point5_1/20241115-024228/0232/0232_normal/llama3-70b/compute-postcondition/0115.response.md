Output State: **`found` is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in `counts`. `color_counts` contains the count of each color in the colors list. `n` is a positive integer greater than 2 and `m` is a positive integer where 1 <= m <= n. `i` is 2. `j` is equal to `n` or `n-1` depending on the length of `colors`. `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` as a key and the value 1 or 2 depending on the iteration. `color` is assigned the value of the last element in `colors`. If `colors` has less than 3 elements, the loop does not execute. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement after the condition is met.**
