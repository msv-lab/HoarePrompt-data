Example Answer:
The variable `left` is assigned the value 0. The previous values of `desired_counts` and `current_counts` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping each color to its desired count; `current_counts` is an empty defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping each color to its desired count; `current_counts` is an empty defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0**
