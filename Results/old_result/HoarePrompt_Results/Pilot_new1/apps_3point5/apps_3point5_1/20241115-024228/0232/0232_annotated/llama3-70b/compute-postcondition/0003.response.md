Example Answer:
The dictionary `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of the subsequent Jedi Knights; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, with 1 ≤ Σ_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n; color_counts is an empty dictionary.
