Output State: **If all colors in `desired_counts` have their counts matching the counts in `current_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, the loop continues to execute, decrementing the count of `colors[left]` and incrementing `left`, without any changes to the other variables. If there is any color where the count in `current_counts` is less than the count in `desired_counts`, the loop will eventually end when this condition is not met.**
