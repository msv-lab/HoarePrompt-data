Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly implements the logic to determine if there exists an interval with the prescribed color counts. It iterates through the list of colors and checks if the current counts match the desired counts. If all colors have the desired counts, it returns 'YES', otherwise, it continues to iterate. The implementation covers all potential cases and edge cases as described in the problem statement.
