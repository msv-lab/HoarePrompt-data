Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, if `found` is True, the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. The output state will be as follows: `window_counts` is a dictionary with color counts, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is the last iteration index, `found` is True if all color counts match target counts, and `color` is the last color encountered. If `found` is False, the program continues without any changes to the output state.***
