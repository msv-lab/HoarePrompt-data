Postcondition: ***All variables `window_counts`, `i`, `j`, `found`, and `color` remain unchanged. The loop or if statement is broken out of if all values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts`. If the condition is not met, the program continues without any changes. All variables maintain their initial conditions as described in the precondition.***
