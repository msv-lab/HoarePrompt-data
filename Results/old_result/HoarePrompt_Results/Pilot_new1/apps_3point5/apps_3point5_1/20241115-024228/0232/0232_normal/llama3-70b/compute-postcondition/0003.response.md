Example Answer:
A dictionary `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. This dictionary will be used to store the count of each color of lightsabers. Since the dictionary is empty, the output state is: `n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from input, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary.
Output State: **`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` is a list of n integers representing colors of lightsabers, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from input, `color_counts` is an empty dictionary**
