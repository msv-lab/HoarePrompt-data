Example Answer:
A dictionary `color_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. This dictionary will be used to store the count of each color of lightsabers. Since it is just initialized and not modified further, the output state is:
Output State: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n; colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers of the Jedi Knights, where each color is in the range {1, 2, ..., m}; counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color from 1 to m, such that 1 <= sum(k_i) <= n; color_counts is an empty dictionary**
