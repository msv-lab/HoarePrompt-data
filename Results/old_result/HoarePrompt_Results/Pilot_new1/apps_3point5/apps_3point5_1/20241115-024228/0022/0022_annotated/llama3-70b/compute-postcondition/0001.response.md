Example Answer:
The length of the string `s` is calculated and assigned to the variable `n`. Since `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` will be an integer between 1 and 1000 representing the length of the string `s`.
Output State: **s is a string of length between 1 and 1000, n is an integer between 1 and 1000**
