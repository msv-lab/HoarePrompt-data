Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0, `is_spalindrome` is True. If the character at index `i` of string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - i - 1`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the loop or if statement is exited. This covers all cases of checking palindrome conditions for the given string `s`.***
