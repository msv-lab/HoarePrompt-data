According to the code, the loop will execute as long as n is greater than or equal to 2. Since n is the length of string s, it means the string s must have at least 2 characters for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, s is a string of English letters with length between 1 and 1000, inclusive, so we need to adjust the state to `s` is a string of English letters with length between 2 and 1000, inclusive and `n` is the length of string s.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with length between 2 and 1000, inclusive, `n` is the length of string s**
