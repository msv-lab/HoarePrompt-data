Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `func_1` to check if a given string `s` is an "s-palindrome" based on the problem description. It iterates through the first half of the string and compares each character with its mirror reflection in the second half. If there is a mismatch, it returns `False`, indicating that the string is not an "s-palindrome". Otherwise, it returns `True`.

The program then takes an input string, calls the `func_1` function, and prints "TAK" if the string is an "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description, and it covers all potential cases where the string should be classified as an "s-palindrome" or not.
