Output State: **If the length of string s is even, the loop will execute n // 2 times. If the character at index i is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - i, the function returns False. If the length of string s is odd, the loop will execute n // 2 times rounded down. If the character at index i is not equal to the character at index n - 1 - i, the function returns False. In cases where n is less than 2, the loop does not execute.**
