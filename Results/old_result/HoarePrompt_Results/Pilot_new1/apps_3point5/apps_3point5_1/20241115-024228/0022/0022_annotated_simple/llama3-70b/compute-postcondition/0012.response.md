According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value. Since the loop checks for characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1`, the next value of `i` should be `i + 1` to compare the next pair of characters. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000, `n` is an integer between 2 and 1000, `i` is adjusted to the next value**
