Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the length of the string `s`, denoted as `|s|`. Since the length of the string `s` is between 1 and 1000, the value of `n` will be between 1 and 1000. Therefore, the Output State is: s is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000; n is an integer between 1 and 1000.
Output State: **s is a string of length |s| such that 1 ≤ |s| ≤ 1000; n is an integer between 1 and 1000**
