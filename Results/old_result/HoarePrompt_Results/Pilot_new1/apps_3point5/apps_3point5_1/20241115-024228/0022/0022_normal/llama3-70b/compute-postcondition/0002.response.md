`is_spalindrome` is assigned the value `True`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: s is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; n is the length of string s, is_spalindrome is True.
Output State: **s is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters; n is the length of string s, is_spalindrome is True**
