Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that checks if a given string `s` is an "s-palindrome" as described in the problem. The function iterates through the characters of `s` comparing the characters at positions `i` and `n - 1 - i` for each `i` in the range of `n // 2`. If any pair of characters are not equal, the function returns False. If the length of `s` is less than 2, the loop does not execute. If all character pairs are equal, the function returns True.

The code then takes an input string `s`, calls the `func_1` function, and prints 'TAK' if the function returns True, and 'NIE' otherwise. The implementation aligns with the problem description and correctly identifies whether a given string is an "s-palindrome". The code covers all potential cases and follows the problem requirements accurately.
