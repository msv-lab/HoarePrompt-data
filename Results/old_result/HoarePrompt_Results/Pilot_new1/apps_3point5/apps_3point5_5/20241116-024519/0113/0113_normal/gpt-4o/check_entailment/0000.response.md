Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two integers `n` and `k` as input and calculates the k-rounding of `n` using the function `func_1`.
- The function `func_1` calculates the value of 'x' by multiplying `n` with a multiplier based on `k` and the greatest common divisor of `n` and the multiplier.
- The function then returns the calculated value of 'x'.
- The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases and provides the expected output for the given examples.
- There are no edge cases or scenarios where the code does not work as expected based on the problem description and the provided examples.
