The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The precondition specifies that `n` is a positive integer and `k` is a non-negative integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8. After executing the function body, the program returns the value of 'x' calculated as n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)). Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two parameters `n` and `k`, calculate the value of 'x' based on the specified formula, and return the result. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two parameters n and k, calculates the value of 'x' using the formula n * (multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier)), and returns the result.**
