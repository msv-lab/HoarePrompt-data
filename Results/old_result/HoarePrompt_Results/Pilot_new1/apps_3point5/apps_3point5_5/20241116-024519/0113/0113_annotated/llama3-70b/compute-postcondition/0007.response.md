According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n` and `x`. If `n % x` is not equal to 0, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer such that n = previous value of n + 4, and `x` is one of the specified values. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to n = previous value of n + 4, and `x` needs to be adjusted to the next value in the sequence. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer such that n = previous value of n + 4, `k` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is the next value in the sequence**
