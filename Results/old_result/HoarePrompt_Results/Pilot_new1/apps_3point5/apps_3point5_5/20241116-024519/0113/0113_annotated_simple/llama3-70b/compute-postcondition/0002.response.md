Example Answer:
The value of `n` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^9. After execution, `n` will be the previous value incremented by 1. The value of `k` remains unchanged as it is not affected by the code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^9; `k` is a positive integer between 0 and 8; `x` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 10^9; `k` is a positive integer between 0 and 8; `x` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
