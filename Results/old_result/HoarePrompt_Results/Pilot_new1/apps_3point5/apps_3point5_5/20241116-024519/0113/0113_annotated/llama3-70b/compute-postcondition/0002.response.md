Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is incremented by 1. Given that `n` is a positive integer, the new value of `n` will be the previous value of `n` plus 1. The value of `k` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer such that n = previous value of n + 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer such that n = previous value of n + 1, `k` is a positive integer such that 0 ≤ k ≤ 8, `x` is 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000**
