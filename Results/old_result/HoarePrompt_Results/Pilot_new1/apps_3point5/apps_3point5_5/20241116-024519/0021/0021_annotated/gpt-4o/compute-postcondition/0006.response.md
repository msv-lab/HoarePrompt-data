Example Answer:
`dist3` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`, which represents the distance of the element at index 0 from the element 1 in the list `a`. The value of `min_pos` represents the index of the element 1 in the list `a`, so `dist3` would be the distance of the element at index 0 from the element 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the element `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is an integer such that 1 <= dist1 <= 99, `dist2` is an integer, and `dist3` is the distance of the element at index 0 from the element 1.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the element `n` in list `a`, `dist1` is an integer such that 1 <= dist1 <= 99, `dist2` is an integer, and `dist3` is the distance of the element at index 0 from the element 1**
