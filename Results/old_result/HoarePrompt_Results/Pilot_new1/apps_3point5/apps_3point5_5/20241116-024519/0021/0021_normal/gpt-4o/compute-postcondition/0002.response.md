Example Answer:
The code finds the index of the element 1 in list `a` and assigns it to `min_pos`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers between 1 and `n`, the index of element 1 in the list will be the minimum possible index. Therefore, `min_pos` will be the minimum position of element 1 in the list `a`.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and `n` (inclusive), `min_pos` is the minimum position of element 1 in list `a`**
