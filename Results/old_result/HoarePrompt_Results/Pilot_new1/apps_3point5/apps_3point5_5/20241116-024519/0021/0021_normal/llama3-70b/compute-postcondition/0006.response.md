Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is n - 1, `max_dist` is the maximum value between abs(pos1 - posn) - 1 and n - 2, `min_dist` is -1. The code prints the maximum value between `max_dist` and n - 1 - `min_dist`.**
