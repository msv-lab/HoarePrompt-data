Example Answer:
The code calculates the maximum of `max_dist` and the difference between `n - 1` and `min_dist`, then prints the result. Since the code only prints the result and does not assign any new values to variables, the initial state remains the same.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `pos1` is 0, `posn` is the index of n in list a, `max_dist` is the maximum distance between the positions of 1 and n in list a, and `min_dist` is the calculated minimum distance**
