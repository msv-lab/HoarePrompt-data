Example Answer:
`dist1` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `max_pos`. The value of `max_pos` is the index of the element `n` in list `a`, which means `max_pos` is equal to `n-1`. Therefore, `dist1` is equal to `abs(0 - (n-1)) = abs(n-1)`. Since `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, the possible values of `dist1` range from 1 to 99.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100, `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers, `min_pos` is the index of the element 1 in list `a`, `max_pos` is the index of the element `n` in list `a`, and `dist1` is an integer such that 1 <= dist1 <= 99**
