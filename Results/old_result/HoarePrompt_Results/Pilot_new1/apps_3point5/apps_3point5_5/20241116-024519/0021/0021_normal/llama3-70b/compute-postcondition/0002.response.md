Example Answer:
The variable `pos1` is assigned the index of the element 1 in the list `a`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to `n`, the index of 1 in the list `a` will be the value of 1 minus 1, which is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 2 <= n <= 100; `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers from 1 to `n`, `pos1` is 0**
