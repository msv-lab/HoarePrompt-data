Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description by finding the positions of the minimum and maximum elements in the array and calculating the distance between them. It then calculates all possible distances based on the positions of the minimum and maximum elements and outputs the maximum distance. The logic of the program is sound and covers all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
