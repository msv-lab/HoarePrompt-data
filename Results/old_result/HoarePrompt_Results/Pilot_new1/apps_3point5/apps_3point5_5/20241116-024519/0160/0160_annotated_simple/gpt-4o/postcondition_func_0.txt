The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of integers. It calculates and returns the greatest common divisor of all elements in the list `lst`. The function assumes that the list `lst` has at least 1 element. If the list has only one element, the function returns that element as the greatest common divisor.
