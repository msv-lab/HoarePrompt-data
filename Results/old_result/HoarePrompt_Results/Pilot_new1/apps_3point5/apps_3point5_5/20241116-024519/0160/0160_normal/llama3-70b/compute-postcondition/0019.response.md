According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `N` is greater than 1, `gcd` is calculated based on list `A`, `max_divisor` is assigned the updated value, `i` is 1. The postcondition states that `max_divisor` is updated based on certain conditions. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be updated to the next value after the last iteration.
State: **N is greater than 1, gcd is calculated based on list A, max_divisor is assigned the updated value, i is the next value after the last iteration**
