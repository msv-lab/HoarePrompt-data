Postcondition: ***N is greater than 1, gcd is calculated based on list A, max_divisor is assigned the updated value, i is the next value after the last iteration. If gcd % i is 0, max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the previous max_divisor and i. If i * i is not equal to gcd, max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the previous max_divisor and gcd divided by i. This ensures that max_divisor reflects the maximum value calculated during the process of updating.***
