According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `x`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1 and `x`, `x` is a positive integer, and `i` is 1. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`divisors` is a set that contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1 and `x`, `x` is a positive integer, `i` is 2**
