Example Answer:
A new value `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`. The set `divisors` already contains all the divisors of `x`, including 1, 2, `x`, `x // 2`, `x // (i+1)`, and `i`. After adding `x // i`, the set `divisors` now includes `x // i` as well. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including 1, 2, `x`, `x // 2`, `x // (i+1)`, `i`, and `x // i`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including 1, 2, `x`, `x // 2`, `x // (i+1)`, `i`, and `x // i`**
