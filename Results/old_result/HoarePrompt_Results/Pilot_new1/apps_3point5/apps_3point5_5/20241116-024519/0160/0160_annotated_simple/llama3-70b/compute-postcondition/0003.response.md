According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range is valid, i.e., N is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, `A` is a list of integers obtained from input, and `gcd` is equal to the first element of list `A`. To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `N` should be greater than 1 and `i` should be 1.
State: **N is greater than 1, `A` is a list of integers obtained from input, `gcd` is equal to the first element of list `A`, `i` is 1**
