Postcondition: ***N is greater than 1, gcd is calculated based on list A, max_divisor is assigned the updated value, i is the next value after the last iteration + 1. If gcd % i is 0, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and i. If i * i is not equal to gcd, then max_divisor is updated to the maximum value between the current max_divisor and gcd divided by i.***
