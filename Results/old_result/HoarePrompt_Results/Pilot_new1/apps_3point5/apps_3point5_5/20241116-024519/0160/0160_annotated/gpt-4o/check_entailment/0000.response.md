Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program consists of two functions, `func_1` and `func_2`, which are used to calculate the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a list of integers and find all the divisors of a given positive integer, respectively.
2. The problem description requires finding the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of the list after performing a certain number of operations. The functions provided in the code can be used to achieve this.
3. `func_1` calculates the GCD of all elements in the list, which is a crucial step in determining the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element.
4. `func_2` finds all the divisors of a given positive integer, which can be used to check if a particular integer divides all elements in the list.
5. By utilizing these functions, the program can accurately determine the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of the list after the operations.
6. The code annotations provide insights into the state of the program after each function is executed, helping to understand the logic and verify its correctness.
7. Given the problem description, the provided functions, and the annotations, there are no apparent cases where the program does not work as expected. Therefore, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
