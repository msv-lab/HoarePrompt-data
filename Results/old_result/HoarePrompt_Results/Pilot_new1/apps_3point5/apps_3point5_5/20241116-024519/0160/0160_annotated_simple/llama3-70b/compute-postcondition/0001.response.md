Example Answer:
The list `A` is assigned the values obtained from splitting the input string into integers. The input is split by spaces, converted into integers, and stored in the list `A`. The previous values of `N` and `K` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: N and K are integers satisfying the given constraints, `A` is a list of integers obtained from input.
Output State: **N and K are integers satisfying the given constraints, `A` is a list of integers obtained from input**
