Postcondition: ***`gcd`, `N`, `max_divisor`, `i + 1` are positive integers. If `i * i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and the result of `gcd` divided by `i`. If `i * i` is equal to `gcd`, no changes are made to the variables.***
