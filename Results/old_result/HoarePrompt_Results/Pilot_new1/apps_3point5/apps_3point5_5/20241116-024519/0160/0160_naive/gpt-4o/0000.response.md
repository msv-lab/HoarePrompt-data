Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values for N, K, and the list of integers A. It then calculates the sum of all elements in A and finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of the elements in A using the function `func_1`. It also generates a set of divisors for the sum of A using the function `func_2`.

After that, the program iterates through the divisors in descending order and checks if the divisor can divide every element of A after the operations specified in the problem description. If it finds a divisor that satisfies this condition, it prints the divisor and breaks out of the loop.

The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and covers all potential cases where the operations can be performed to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A.
