Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly computes the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations. It first calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in A. Then, it iterates through all possible divisors of the gcd up to its square root to find the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A. The program correctly handles all potential cases and provides the correct output based on the problem description.
