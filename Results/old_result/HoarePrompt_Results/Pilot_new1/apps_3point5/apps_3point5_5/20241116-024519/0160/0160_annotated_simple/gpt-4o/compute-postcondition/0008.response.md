Example Answer:
The code adds the value of x divided by i to the set divisors. Since the set divisors already contains all the divisors of x, including i and x // i, adding x // i will not change the set. Therefore, the Output State is: divisors is a set containing all the divisors of x, including i and x // i, where i is a positive integer less than or equal to x.
Output State: **divisors is a set containing all the divisors of x, including i and x // i, where i is a positive integer less than or equal to x**
