Example Answer:
The value of `i` is added to the set `divisors`, which contains all the divisors of `x`. The set `divisors` now includes `i` as one of its elements. The positive integer `x` is divided by 2, and `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including 1, 2, `x`, `x // 2`, `x // (i+1)`, and `i`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including 1, 2, `x`, `x // 2`, `x // (i+1)`, and `i`**
