Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly takes the input of N, K, and the list of integers A.
2. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in list A using the math.gcd() function.
3. It then iterates through the range from 1 to the square root of gcd to find the maximum divisor that divides every element of A.
4. The program outputs the correct maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations.
5. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and handles all potential cases.
