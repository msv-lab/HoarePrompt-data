The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer. The parameter `s` is also an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99. The function also utilizes the `ones` list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine. 

After executing the function body, the function returns different string representations of the input integer `n` based on the following conditions:
- If 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the function returns the string representation of the number `n` from the `ones` list.
- If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the string representation of the number `n` from a `teens` list.
- If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99, the function covers two cases: 
  - If n % 10 == 0, it returns the string representing the tens digit of `n`.
  - Otherwise, it returns the string representation of the number `n` in words, combining the string representing the tens digit of `n` with a hyphen and the string representing the ones digit of `n`.

The postcondition ensures the correct representation of the tens and ones digits of the input integer `n` for all possible scenarios, including edge cases. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept an integer `n` and return the correct string representation of the tens and ones digits of `n` based on the specified conditions. 
Functionality: **The function accepts an integer `n` and returns the correct string representation of the tens and ones digits of `n` based on the specified conditions.**
