The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function operates with the preconditions that `s` is an integer such that 0 <= s <= 99. The function does not have any return value. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func` is to operate without any parameters and without returning any value, while ensuring that the integer `s` provided as input satisfies the preconditions 0 <= s <= 99.
