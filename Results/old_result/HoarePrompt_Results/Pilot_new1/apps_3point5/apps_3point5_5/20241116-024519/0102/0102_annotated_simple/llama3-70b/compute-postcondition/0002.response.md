Example Answer:
The list `tens` is assigned a list of strings representing tens from zero to nine. The values in the list are fixed and do not depend on the initial state of the program. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine**
