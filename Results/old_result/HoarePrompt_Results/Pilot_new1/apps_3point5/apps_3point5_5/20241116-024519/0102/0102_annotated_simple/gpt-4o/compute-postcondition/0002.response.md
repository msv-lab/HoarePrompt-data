The variable `tens` is assigned a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine. This list will be used to convert the tens place of a given number into words. The initial state remains the same.
Output State: **`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99; `ones` is a list of strings representing numbers from zero to nine**
