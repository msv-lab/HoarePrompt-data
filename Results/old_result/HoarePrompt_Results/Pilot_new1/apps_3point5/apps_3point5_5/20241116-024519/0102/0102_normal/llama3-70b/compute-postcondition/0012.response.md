Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer where 0 <= s <= 99. If s is less than 10, the program prints the value corresponding to the ones[s] index. If s is between 10 and 19, the program prints the value corresponding to the teens[s - 10] index. If s is 20 or greater, the program prints the combination of the value at tens[s // 10] and ones[s % 10] indices, with a hyphen in between if s % 10 is not equal to 0. The program handles all cases within the given range of s, ensuring the correct output is generated based on the conditions defined.***
