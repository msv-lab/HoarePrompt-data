Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer where 10 <= s <= 99. If s is less than 20, the program prints the value corresponding to the teens[s - 10] index. If s is 20 or greater, the program prints the combination of tens[s // 10] and ones[s % 10] with a hyphen in between if s % 10 is not equal to 0. The program successfully handles all cases within the given range of s.***
