The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`, which is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. After executing the function body, if 0 ≤ n ≤ 9, the function returns the word representation of the number at index n in the 'ones' list. If 11 ≤ n ≤ 19, the function returns the word representation of the number at index n-10 in the 'teens' list. If 10 ≤ n ≤ 99 and n is not between 11 and 19, the function returns the word representation of the tens place of n based on the index n // 10 in the 'tens' list concatenated with a hyphen and the word representation of the ones place of n from the 'ones' list. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios within the given range of n values, ensuring all edge cases are accounted for.
Functionality: **The function accepts an integer n such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99. It returns the word representation of the number based on the rules specified for different ranges of n values.**
