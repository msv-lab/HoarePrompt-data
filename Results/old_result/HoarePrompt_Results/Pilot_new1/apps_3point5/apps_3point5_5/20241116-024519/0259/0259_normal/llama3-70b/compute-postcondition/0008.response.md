According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times where `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `n` needs to be adjusted to `n+1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 101, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)` along with the newly appended tuple**
