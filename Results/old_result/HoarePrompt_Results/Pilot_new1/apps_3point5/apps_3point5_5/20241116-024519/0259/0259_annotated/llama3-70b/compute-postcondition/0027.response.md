Example Answer:
The value of `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. The previous values of `t`, `s`, and `d` are unknown, so the output state is: `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, `min_time`, `ans`, `i` remain integers, and the `buses` list still has more elements.
Output State: **`time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, `min_time`, `ans`, `i` remain integers, and the `buses` list still has more elements**
