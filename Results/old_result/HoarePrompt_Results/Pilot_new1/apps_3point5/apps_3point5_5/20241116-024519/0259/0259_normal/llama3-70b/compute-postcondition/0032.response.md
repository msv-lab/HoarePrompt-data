Output State: **`min_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum calculated time, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least one tuple, `ans` is an integer representing the index of the tuple in `buses` plus 1. If `buses` is an empty list, the loop does not execute, and `min_time` remains positive infinity, `buses` remains an empty list, and `ans` remains -1.**
