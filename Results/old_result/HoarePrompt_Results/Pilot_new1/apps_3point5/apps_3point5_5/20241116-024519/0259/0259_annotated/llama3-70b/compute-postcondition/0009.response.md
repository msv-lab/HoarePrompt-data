Example Answer:
The input is split into two values `s` and `d` after converting them to integers using the `map` function. The values of `s` and `d` are updated accordingly. The variables `n`, `t`, and `buses` remain unchanged.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 3 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the appended tuple `(s, d)`**
