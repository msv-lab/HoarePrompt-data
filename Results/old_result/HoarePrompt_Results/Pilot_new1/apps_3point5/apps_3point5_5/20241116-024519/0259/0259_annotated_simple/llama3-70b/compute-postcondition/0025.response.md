Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 0, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `buses` contains a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `(s, d)` is the second tuple in the list, `min_time` is assigned the value of `time`, `ans` is equal to `i + 1`, `i` is 1 (updated for the next iteration), and `time` is calculated based on the current values of `t`, `s`, and `d. If the calculated `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to this new `time` value and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`.***
