Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all bus routes. `chosen_route` is an integer indicating the index of the bus route with the minimum wait time incremented by 1. `n` is greater than 0. `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`. The value of `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions mentioned in the precondition. If the calculated `wait_time` is less than the previous `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to this new value and `chosen_route` is set to the index of the current bus route incremented by 1. This process ensures that the variables `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are updated to reflect the bus route with the shortest wait time.***
