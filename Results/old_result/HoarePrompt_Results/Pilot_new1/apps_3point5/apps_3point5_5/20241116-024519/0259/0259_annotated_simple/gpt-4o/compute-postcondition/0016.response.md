Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum waiting time. If `wait_time` is less than `min_wait_time`, then `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`. The values of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are modified based on the comparison with `wait_time`. Otherwise, there are no changes to `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route`.***
