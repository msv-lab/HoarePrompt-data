According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more tuples in the `buses` list. At the end of the last iteration, `min_time` is a positive integer, `buses` has at least 2 tuples, `ans` represents the index of the next tuple in `buses` plus 1, `i` is 0, `s` and `d` are the values of the next tuple in `buses`, and `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, with the calculated `time` being less than `min_time`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next tuple in `buses` should be considered. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `i` should be incremented by 1 to move to the next tuple in `buses`.
- The values of `s` and `d` should be updated to the values of the next tuple in `buses`.
- If the calculated `time` for the next tuple is less than the current `min_time`, then `min_time` should be updated to the new calculated `time`, and `ans` should be set to `i + 1`.

State: **`min_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum time calculated, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `ans` is an integer representing the index of the next tuple in `buses` plus 1, `i` is 1, `s` and `d` are the values of the next tuple in `buses`, `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`, and the calculated `time` is less than `min_time`.**
