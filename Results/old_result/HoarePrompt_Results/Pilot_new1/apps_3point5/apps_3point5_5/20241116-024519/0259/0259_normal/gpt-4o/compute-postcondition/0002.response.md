According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, and `chosen_route` is -1. 
State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0**
