Example Answer:
The variables `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of `bus_routes[i]`. The values of `bus_routes[i]` are not given in the initial state, so we cannot determine the exact values of `s_i` and `d_i`. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
