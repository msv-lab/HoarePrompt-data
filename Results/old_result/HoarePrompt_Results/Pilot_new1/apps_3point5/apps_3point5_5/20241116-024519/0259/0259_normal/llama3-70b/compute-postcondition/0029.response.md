Example Answer: 
The variable `ans` is assigned the value of `i + 1`. The previous values of `i` and `ans` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `min_time` is updated to the calculated `time`, where `time` is `(t - s) % d`; `ans` is `i + 1`.
Output State: **`min_time` is updated to the calculated `time`, where `time` is `(t - s) % d`; `ans` is `i + 1`**
