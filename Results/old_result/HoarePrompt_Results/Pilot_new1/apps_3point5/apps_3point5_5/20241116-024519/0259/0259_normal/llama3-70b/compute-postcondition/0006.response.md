Example Answer:
The code takes input and splits it into two integers `s` and `d`. The values of `s` and `d` are affected by the input. The initial state mentions that `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, and `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`. After running the code, the values of `s` and `d` are determined by the input. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 2 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains the tuple `(s, d)`**
