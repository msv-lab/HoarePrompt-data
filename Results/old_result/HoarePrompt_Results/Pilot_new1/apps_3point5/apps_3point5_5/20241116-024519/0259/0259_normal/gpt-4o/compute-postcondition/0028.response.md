Example Answer:
`s_i` is assigned the value of `bus_routes[i+1]`, and `d_i` is assigned the value of `bus_routes[i+1]`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are updated based on the iteration of the loop. `chosen_route` and `min_wait_time` are not directly affected by this assignment. `i` is incremented by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is updated based on loop calculations, `chosen_route` is updated based on loop calculations, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i+1]`, `i` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is updated based on loop calculations, `chosen_route` is updated based on loop calculations, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i+1]`, `i` is incremented by 1**
