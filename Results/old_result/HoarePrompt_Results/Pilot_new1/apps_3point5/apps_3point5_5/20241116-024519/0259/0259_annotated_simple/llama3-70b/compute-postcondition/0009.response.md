Example Answer:
The code snippet `s, d = map(int, input().split())` takes an input line, splits it by spaces, converts the values to integers, and assigns them to variables `s` and `d`. The previous values of `s` and `d` are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `buses` contains the updated list of tuples, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 2, `t` is a positive integer within the specified range, `buses` contains the updated list of tuples, `s` is an input integer, `d` is an input integer**
