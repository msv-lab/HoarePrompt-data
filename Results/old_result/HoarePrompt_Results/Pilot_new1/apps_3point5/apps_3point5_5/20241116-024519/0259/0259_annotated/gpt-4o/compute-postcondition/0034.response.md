Example Answer:
`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`. The value of `wait_time` is determined based on the conditions mentioned in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values, and `min_wait_time` is updated based on the calculation of `wait_time`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values, and `min_wait_time` is updated based on the calculation of `wait_time`**
