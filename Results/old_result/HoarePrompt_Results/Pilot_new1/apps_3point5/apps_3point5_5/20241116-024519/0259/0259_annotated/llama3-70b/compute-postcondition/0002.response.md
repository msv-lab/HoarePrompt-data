According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times, so `n` being a positive integer between 1 and 100 ensures the loop will run. The loop does not depend on `t` or `buses`, so they can remain unchanged. Before the loop starts, `buses` is an empty list does not affect the execution of the loop.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is an empty list**
