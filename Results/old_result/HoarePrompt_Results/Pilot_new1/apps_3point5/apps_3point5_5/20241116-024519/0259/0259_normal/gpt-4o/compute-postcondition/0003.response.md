Example Answer: 
`s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values from `bus_routes[i]`. The values of `s_i` and `d_i` depend on the specific values in `bus_routes[i]`. The variables `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values from `bus_routes[i]`**
