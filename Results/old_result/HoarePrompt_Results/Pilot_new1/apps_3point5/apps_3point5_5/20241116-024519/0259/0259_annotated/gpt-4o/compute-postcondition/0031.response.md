Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is calculated based on the values of `d_i`, `t`, and `s_i`. The value of `wait_time` is dependent on these variables, and without knowing their specific values, we cannot determine the exact value of `wait_time`. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route, `s_i` is assigned a value, `d_i` is assigned a value, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the chosen route, `s_i` is assigned a value, `d_i` is assigned a value, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the given formula**
