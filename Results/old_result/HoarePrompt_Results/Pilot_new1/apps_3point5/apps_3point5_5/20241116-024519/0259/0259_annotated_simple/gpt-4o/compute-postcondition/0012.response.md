Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of the first tuple in `bus_routes` at index 0. If `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`.***
