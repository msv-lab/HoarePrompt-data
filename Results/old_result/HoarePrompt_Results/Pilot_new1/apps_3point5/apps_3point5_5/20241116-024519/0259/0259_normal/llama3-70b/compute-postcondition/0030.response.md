Postcondition: ***`min_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum calculated time, `buses` is a list of tuples with at least 2 tuples, `ans` is an integer representing the index of the next tuple in `buses` plus 1, `i` is 1, `s` and `d` are the values of the next tuple in `buses`. If the calculated time is less than the current `min_time`, `min_time` is updated to the calculated time, and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. The program state remains consistent with the initial conditions, ensuring the correct updating of `min_time` and `ans` based on the calculated time.***
