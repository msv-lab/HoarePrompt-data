Example Answer:
The variable `numerator` is assigned the value 1. The value of `total_days` is dependent on the value of `n`, which is not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1.
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1**
