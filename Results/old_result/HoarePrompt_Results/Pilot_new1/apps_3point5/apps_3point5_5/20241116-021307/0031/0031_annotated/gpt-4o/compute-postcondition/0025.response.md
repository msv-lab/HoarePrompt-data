Output State: **If k is greater than 0, p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator; if k is 0 or negative, p_no_shared remains 1; p_total is assigned the value of denominator; p_shared is the result of the calculation (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD; A is assigned the value of p_shared; B is assigned the value of p_total; g is assigned the result of calling func_1 with A and B; A is updated by performing floor division with g**.
