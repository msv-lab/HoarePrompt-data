According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2 to the power of `n` multiplied by (`total_days` - 1), `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days` squared, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0. Since `i` is less than `k`, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2 to the power of `n` multiplied by (`total_days` - 1), `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days` squared, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
