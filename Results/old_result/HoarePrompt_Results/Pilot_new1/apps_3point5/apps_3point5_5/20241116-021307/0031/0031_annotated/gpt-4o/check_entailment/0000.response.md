Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The code correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days.
2. It handles the edge case where k is greater than 2^n by printing 1 and 1, as it is guaranteed that two people will share the same birthday in this case.
3. The code uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and prints the irreducible fraction A/B modulo 10^6 + 3, which is the required output format.
4. The function `func_1` correctly calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers, which is used to simplify the fraction A/B.

Overall, the code aligns with the problem description and the provided annotations, covering all potential cases and providing the correct output.
