According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated value, `denominator` is updated value, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
