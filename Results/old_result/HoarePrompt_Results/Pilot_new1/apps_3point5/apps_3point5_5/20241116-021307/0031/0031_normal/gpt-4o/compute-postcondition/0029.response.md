Functionality: **The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. If `k` is greater than 2 to the power of `n`, the program prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, it calculates values for `numerator`, `denominator`, `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, `p_shared`, `A`, and `B` based on the given formulas and constant MOD value. Finally, it calls `func_1` with `A` and `B`, performs additional calculations, and prints the results modulo MOD.**
