According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `numerator` by `(total_days - i)`, `denominator` is `total_days`, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0. Since `i` is 0 and needs to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time, it should be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `numerator` by `(total_days - 1)`, `denominator` is `total_days`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0**
