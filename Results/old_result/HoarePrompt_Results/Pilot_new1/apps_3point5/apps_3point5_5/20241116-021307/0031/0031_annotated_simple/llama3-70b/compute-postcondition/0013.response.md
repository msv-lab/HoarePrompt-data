Output State: **If k is greater than 0, after the loop executes, `numerator` is the product of factorials from `total_days` to `total_days - k + 1`, `denominator` is `total_days` to the power of `k`, `i` is at least k. If k is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute and `numerator` remains 1, `denominator` remains `total_days` to the power of `k`, `i` is 0.**
