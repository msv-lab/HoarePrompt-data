Example Answer:
The `denominator` is updated by multiplying the current value of `denominator` with `total_days` and then taking the modulo with `MOD`. Since `total_days` is 1 left shifted by `n`, and `n` is 0, the value of `total_days` remains 1. Therefore, the new value of `denominator` is 1 % MOD, which is 1. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1, numerator has been updated, denominator is 1, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
