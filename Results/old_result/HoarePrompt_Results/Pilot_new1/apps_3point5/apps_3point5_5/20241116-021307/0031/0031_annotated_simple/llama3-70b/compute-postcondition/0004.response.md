Example Answer:
`numerator` is multiplied by the value of `total_days - i`, where `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, and `i` is 0. Since the initial state of `total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, and `i` is 0, the value of `total_days - i` is 2 to the power of `n`. Therefore, `numerator` is multiplied by 2 to the power of `n`. The states of other variables remain the same. 
Output State: **`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by 2 to the power of `n`, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
