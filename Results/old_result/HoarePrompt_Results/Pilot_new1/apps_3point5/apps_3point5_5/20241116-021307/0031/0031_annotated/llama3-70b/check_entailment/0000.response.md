Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly calculates the probability of at least two out of k people sharing the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. The code follows the problem description by calculating the numerator and denominator as required, finding their greatest common divisor, and returning the remainders of numerator and denominator modulo (10^6 + 3). The annotations also provide a clear explanation of what the code does and how it updates the variables `numerator` and `denominator` within the for loop. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description align with the expected behavior of the code. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
