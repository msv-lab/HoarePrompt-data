Example Answer:
`numerator` is assigned the value `1`, and the other variables `MOD` and `total_days` are not affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 left shifted by n, numerator is 1.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 left shifted by n, numerator is 1**
