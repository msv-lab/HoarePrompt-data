Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts two integers n and k, calculates the values of numerator and denominator based on the given formulas, then finds the greatest common divisor (gcd) of numerator and denominator. Finally, it returns the remainders of numerator and denominator divided by (10^6 + 3). The code does not handle the case where k is 0 or negative, which could potentially lead to incorrect results due to the loop not executing as expected.**
