Output State: **If k is greater than 0, `total_days` remains 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is updated to the result of the product of `(total_days - 1) * (total_days - 2) * ... * (total_days - k) * numerator`, `denominator` is updated to the result of the product of `total_days * (total_days - 1) * (total_days - 2) * ... * (total_days - k + 1)`, `i` is equal to k. If k is 0 or negative, `numerator` and `denominator` remain 1. `gcd` is assigned the greatest common divisor of `numerator` and `denominator`.**
