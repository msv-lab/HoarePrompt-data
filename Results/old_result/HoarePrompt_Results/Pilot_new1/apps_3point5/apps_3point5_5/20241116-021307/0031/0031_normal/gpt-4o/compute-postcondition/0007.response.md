Example Answer: 
`denominator` is assigned the value 1. The previous values of `MOD`, `total_days`, and `numerator` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 left shifted by n, numerator is 1, denominator is 1.
Output State: **MOD is 1000003, total_days is 1 left shifted by n, numerator is 1, denominator is 1**
