Example Answer:
The value of `numerator` is updated by multiplying the current value of `numerator` with the result of `(total_days - i) % MOD`. Since `total_days` is calculated as 1 shifted left by `n`, and `i` is 0, the result of `(total_days - i)` is equivalent to `total_days`. Therefore, `numerator` is updated to `numerator * total_days % MOD`. 
Output State: **`MOD` is 1000003, `total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`, `numerator` is updated value, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
