Example Answer: 
The value of `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, and all other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: numerator is the product of (total_days - i) for each i in the range of k, denominator is the product of total_days for each i in the range of k, MOD is 1000003; p_no_shared is 1, p_total is the value of denominator.
Output State: **numerator is the product of (total_days - i) for each i in the range of k, denominator is the product of total_days for each i in the range of k, MOD is 1000003; p_no_shared is 1, p_total is the value of denominator**
