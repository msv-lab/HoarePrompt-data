The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The constraints for these parameters are that `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. The function also has a constant MOD value of 1000003. 

After executing the function body, if `k` is greater than 2 to the power of `n`, the program prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, the program does nothing. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k`, and if `k` is greater than 2 to the power of `n`, it prints 1, 1 and returns. Otherwise, it does nothing.
