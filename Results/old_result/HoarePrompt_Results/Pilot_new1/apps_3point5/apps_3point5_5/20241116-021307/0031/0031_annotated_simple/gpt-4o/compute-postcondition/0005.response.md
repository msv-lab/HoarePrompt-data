Example Answer:
`total_days` is assigned the value of 1 shifted left by `n`. Since the value of `n` is not provided, the exact value of `total_days` cannot be determined. If `k` is greater than `total_days`, the program prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, the program returns nothing.
Output State: **`total_days` is 1 shifted left by `n`. If `k` is greater than `total_days`, the program prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, the program returns nothing.**
