Example Answer:
`B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `p_total` is the value of the denominator. Therefore, after execution, `B` will have the value of the denominator. Other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **numerator is the product of (total_days - i) for each i in the range of k, denominator is the product of total_days for each i in the range of k, MOD is 1000003; p_no_shared is 1, p_total is the value of denominator, p_shared is the result of the expression (p_total - p_no_shared + MOD) % MOD, A is the calculated value of p_shared, B is the value of the denominator**
