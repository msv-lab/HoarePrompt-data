According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If k is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 0 and `i` is now 0. 
State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is 1, `denominator` is 1, `i` is 0, `k` is greater than 0**
