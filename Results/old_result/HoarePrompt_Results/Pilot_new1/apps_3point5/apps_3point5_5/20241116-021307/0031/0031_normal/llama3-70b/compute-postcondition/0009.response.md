According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `numerator` by `(total_days - 1)`, `denominator` is `total_days` multiplied by 2 raised to the power of `n`, `i` is 1, `k` is greater than 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`total_days` is 2 raised to the power of `n`, `numerator` is the result of multiplying the previous value of `numerator` by `(total_days - 1)`, `denominator` is `total_days` multiplied by 2 raised to the power of `n`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0**
