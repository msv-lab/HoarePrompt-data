Output State: **If both n and k are positive integers, such that 1 <= n, k <= 10^10, after the loop executes:
- If n and k are coprime (i.e., their greatest common divisor is 1), a will be the smaller of the two values and b will be 0.
- If n and k are not coprime, a will be their greatest common divisor, and b will be 0.
- If either n or k is 0, the loop will not execute.**
