The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The precondition is that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10. 

In Case_1, if the sum of the first `k` positive integers, denoted as `min_sum`, is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.

In Case_2, the program returns the final state of the sequence list after the loop execution. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two positive integer parameters `n` and `k`, calculate the sum of the first `k` positive integers, and return -1 if the sum is greater than `n`. Otherwise, it returns the final state of the sequence list after the loop execution.
