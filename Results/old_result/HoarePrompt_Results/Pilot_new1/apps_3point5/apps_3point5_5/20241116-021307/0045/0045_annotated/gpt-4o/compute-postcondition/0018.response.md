According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range specified. At the end of the last iteration, there was no change in the state of the variables, and `k` is greater than 1. Since the loop is iterating in reverse from `k - 1` to 0, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be one less than the current value of `i`.
State: **No change in the state of the variables, `k` is greater than 1**
