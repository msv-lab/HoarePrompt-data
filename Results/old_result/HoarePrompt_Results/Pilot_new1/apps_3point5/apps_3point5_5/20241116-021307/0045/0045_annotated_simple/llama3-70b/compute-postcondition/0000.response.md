Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b`, while `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. The new values of `a` and `b` depend on the previous values of `a` and `b`. Since the initial state is not provided, the exact values cannot be determined. Therefore, the output state is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10**
