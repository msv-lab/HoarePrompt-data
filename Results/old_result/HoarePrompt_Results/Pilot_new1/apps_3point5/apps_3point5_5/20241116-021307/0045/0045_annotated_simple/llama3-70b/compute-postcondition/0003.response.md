According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `b`. If `b` is truthy (evaluates to True), the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `a` and `b` are updated based on the calculations. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `b` needs to be adjusted to be truthy. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` and `b` are updated based on the calculations, and `b` is truthy**
