Example Answer: 
The value of `remainder` is decremented by 1. The previous value of `remainder` is unknown, so the new value will vary. If the new value of `remainder` is 0, the loop or if statement will be exited. Therefore, the Output State is: All variables remain the same, except the sequence at index i is incremented by 1 and i is decremented by 1. If the remainder is 0, the loop or if statement is exited.
Output State: **All variables remain the same, except the sequence at index i is incremented by 1 and i is decremented by 1. If the remainder is 0, the loop or if statement is exited.**
