Example Answer:
The value of `d` is calculated by dividing `n` by `min_sum`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `d` is calculated based on the division. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1; otherwise, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of the first `k` positive integers. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1; otherwise, `d` is calculated as `n // min_sum`**
