Example Answer:
The values of a and b are swapped, and a is assigned the value of b, and b is assigned the value of the remainder of a divided by b. The initial values of a and b are positive integers. Therefore, the output state is: a and b have been updated based on the calculations.
Output State: **a and b have been updated based on the calculations**
