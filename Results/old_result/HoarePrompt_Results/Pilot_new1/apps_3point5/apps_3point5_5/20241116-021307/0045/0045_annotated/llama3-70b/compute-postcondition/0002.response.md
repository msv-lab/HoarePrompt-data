Example Answer:
`a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `b` is truthy, the value of `a % b` depends on the previous values of `a` and `b`. After the calculations, the new values of `a` and `b` are updated accordingly.
Output State: **`a` and `b` have been updated based on the calculations, `b` is truthy**
