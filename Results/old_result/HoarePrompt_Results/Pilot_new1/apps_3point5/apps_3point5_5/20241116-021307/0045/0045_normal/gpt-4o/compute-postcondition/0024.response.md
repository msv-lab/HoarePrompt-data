Output State: **`sequence` is a list containing elements that are multiples of `d` starting from `d`, range depends on `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `d` is the starting value of the multiples, `i` is -1, `remainder` is 0 or negative. If `remainder` is 0, the loop breaks. If `k` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute.**
