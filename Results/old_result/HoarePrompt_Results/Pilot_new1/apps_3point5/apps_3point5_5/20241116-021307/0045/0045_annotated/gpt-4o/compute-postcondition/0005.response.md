Example Answer:
The value of `remainder` is calculated by subtracting `d * min_sum` from `n`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `remainder` is updated accordingly. No other variables are affected by this operation.
Output State: **No change in the state of the variables or function returns -1 if `min_sum` is greater than `n`**
