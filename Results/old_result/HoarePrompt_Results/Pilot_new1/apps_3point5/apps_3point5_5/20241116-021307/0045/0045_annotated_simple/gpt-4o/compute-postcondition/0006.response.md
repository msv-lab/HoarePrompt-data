Example Answer:
The list `sequence` is created by multiplying each element `d` with `(i + 1)` where `i` ranges from 0 to `k-1`. The values of `d` and `k` are not given, so the output state will be: `n`, `k`, `min_sum` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, and if `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `min_sum` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^10, and if `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1**
