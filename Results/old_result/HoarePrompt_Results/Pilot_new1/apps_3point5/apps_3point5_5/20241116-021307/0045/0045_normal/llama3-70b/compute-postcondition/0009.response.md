Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`, where 1 <= n, k <= 10^10. After execution, it returns the smaller value between n and k if they are coprime (having a greatest common divisor of 1), or their greatest common divisor if they are not coprime. If either n or k is 0, the function does not execute the loop and returns 0. **
