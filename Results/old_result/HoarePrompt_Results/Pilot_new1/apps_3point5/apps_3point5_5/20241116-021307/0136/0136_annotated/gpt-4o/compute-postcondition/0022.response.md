Postcondition: ***`a`, `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. The length of `a` is greater or equal to the length of `b`. The integer value represented by `a` is greater than or equal to the integer value represented by `b`. If `a` is greater than `b`, then the program prints '>'. Otherwise, if `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. This covers all possible cases where `a` and `b` satisfy the given conditions.***
