Example Answer:
The value at index 0 of the list `data` is accessed and leading zeros are removed using the `lstrip` method. The result is assigned to variable `a`. The state of other variables remains unchanged. 
Output State: **`data` is a list containing the split input values, `a` is the value at index 0 of `data` with leading zeros removed**
