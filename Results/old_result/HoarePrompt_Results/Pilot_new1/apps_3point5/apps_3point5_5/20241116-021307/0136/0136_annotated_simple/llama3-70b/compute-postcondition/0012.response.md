Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative integers `a` and `b` represented as strings with no leading zeros. It compares `a` and `b` and prints '=' if they are equal, '<' if `a` is less than `b, and '>' if `a` is greater than `b`. This covers all possible cases for the comparison between `a` and `b.**
