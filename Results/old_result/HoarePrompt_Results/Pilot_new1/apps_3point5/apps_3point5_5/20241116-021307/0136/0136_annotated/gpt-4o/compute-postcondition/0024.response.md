Postcondition: ***`a`, `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If `a` evaluates to False, then `a` is assigned the string '0'. In all other cases, the values of `a` and `b` remain unchanged. If `b` is False, it is assigned the string '0'. The length of `a` is greater or equal to the length of `b`. If the integer value represented by `a` is greater than the integer value represented by `b`, the program prints '>'. If the integer value represented by `a` is less than the integer value represented by `b`, the program prints '<'. If the integer value represented by `a` is equal to the integer value represented by `b`, the program prints '='. This encompasses all scenarios where `a` and `b` meet the specified criteria.***
