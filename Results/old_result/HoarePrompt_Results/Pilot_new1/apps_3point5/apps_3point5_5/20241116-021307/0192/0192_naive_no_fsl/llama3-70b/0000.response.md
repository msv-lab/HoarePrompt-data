Correctness: False

The provided program simply calculates the absolute difference between the starting side length x and the ending side length y, which is not the correct approach to solve the problem. The program should calculate the minimum number of seconds required to transform the equilateral triangle of side length x to side length y by modifying the length of a single side at a time while maintaining the triangle properties.

An example where the program does not work as expected:
Input:
6 3

Output:
3

Explanation:
The correct minimum number of seconds required should be 4 (as shown in the problem description), but the program incorrectly outputs 3.
