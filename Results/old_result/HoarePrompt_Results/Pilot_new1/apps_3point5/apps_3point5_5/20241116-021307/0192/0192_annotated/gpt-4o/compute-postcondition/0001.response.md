Example Answer:
The code calculates (x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2. Since x and y are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000, the result of (x - y) will always be an integer. The // operator performs integer division, so the result will be an integer. The % operator calculates the remainder, which will be either 0 or 1. Therefore, the output state is: x and y are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000.
Output State: **x and y are integers satisfying 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000**
