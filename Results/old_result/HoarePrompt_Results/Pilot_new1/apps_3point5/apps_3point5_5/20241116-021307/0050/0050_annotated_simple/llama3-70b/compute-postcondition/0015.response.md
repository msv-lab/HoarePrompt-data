Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by taking the modulus of `r` by `s[i]`. The value of `r` is updated based on the division of `r` by `s[i]`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `shares` is an integer, r is greater than or equal to s[i], and `shares` is updated based on the division of r by s[i].
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `shares` is an integer, r is greater than or equal to s[i], and `shares` is updated based on the division of r by s[i]**
