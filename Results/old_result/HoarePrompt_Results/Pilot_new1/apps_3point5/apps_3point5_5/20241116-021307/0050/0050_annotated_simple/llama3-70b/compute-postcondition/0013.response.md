According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `r`. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `shares` is an integer. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `r` needs to be greater than or equal to `s[i]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `shares` is an integer, r is greater than or equal to s[i]**
