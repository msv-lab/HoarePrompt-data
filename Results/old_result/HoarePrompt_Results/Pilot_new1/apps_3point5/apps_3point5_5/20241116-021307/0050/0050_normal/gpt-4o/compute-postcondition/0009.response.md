Example Answer: 
`remaining_bourles` is assigned the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`. The value of `remaining_bourles` depends on the values of `r` and `min_buy_price`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers from the input. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`. The `max_sell_price` is greater than `min_buy_price`. `max_shares` is calculated as `r // min_buy_price`; `remaining_bourles` is the remainder of dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`.
