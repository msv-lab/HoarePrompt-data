Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of list `b`, `max_shares` is the result of integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is between 0 and the minimum value of the list `s`, `total_bourles` is calculated as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`. The output will be the value of `total_bourles` printed by the code.**
