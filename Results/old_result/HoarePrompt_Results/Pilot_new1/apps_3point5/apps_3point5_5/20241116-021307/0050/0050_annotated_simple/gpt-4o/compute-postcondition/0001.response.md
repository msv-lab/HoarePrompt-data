Example Answer: 
`s` is assigned the list of integers obtained by mapping the input split by spaces to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000**
