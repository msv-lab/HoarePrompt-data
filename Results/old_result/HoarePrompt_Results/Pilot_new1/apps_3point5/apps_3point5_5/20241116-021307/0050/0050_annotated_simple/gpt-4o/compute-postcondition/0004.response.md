Example Answer:
`max_sell_price` is assigned the maximum value of list `b`. The values of `n`, `m`, `r`, and `min_buy_price` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of list `b`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, and `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`; `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of list `b`**
