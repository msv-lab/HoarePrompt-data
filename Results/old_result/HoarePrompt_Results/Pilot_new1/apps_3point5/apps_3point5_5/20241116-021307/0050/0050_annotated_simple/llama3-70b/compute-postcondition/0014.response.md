Example Answer:
`shares` is incremented by the integer division of `r` by `s[i]`. The values of `r` and `s[i]` are given to be integers, and `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`. Therefore, `shares` is updated accordingly. 
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m`, `r` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `shares` is an integer, r is greater than or equal to s[i], `shares` is updated based on the division of r by s[i]**
