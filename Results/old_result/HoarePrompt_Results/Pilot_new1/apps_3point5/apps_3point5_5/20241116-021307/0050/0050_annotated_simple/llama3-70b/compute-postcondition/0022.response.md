Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `shares` are integers. If `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, then `shares` is updated to `shares + r // s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of `r` divided by `s[i]`. If `r` is less than `s[i]`, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement. All variables maintain their initial constraints and values after the execution of the if else block.***
