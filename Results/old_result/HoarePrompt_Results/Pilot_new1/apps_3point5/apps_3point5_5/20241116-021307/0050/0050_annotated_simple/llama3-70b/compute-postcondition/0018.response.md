According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, and `shares` is an integer. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. `n` should be greater than the current value of `i`.
2. If the loop executed the if statement (r >= s[i]) in the previous iteration, then the new value of `r` should be the remainder of the division of the previous `r` by s[i].
3. If the loop executed the if statement (r >= s[i]) in the previous iteration, then the new value of `shares` should be updated by adding the result of r divided by s[i].

State: **`n` is greater than the current value of `i`, `m` and `r` are integers such that 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000, `shares` is an integer, updated `r` and `shares` based on the conditions mentioned above.**
