Example Answer:
The list `s` is created by mapping the input values to integers. The input is split by spaces and converted to integers. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are not affected by this code. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, and `s` is a list of integers.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints, `s` is a list of integers**
