Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `m`, `r` may have been modified based on the condition `r >= s[i]`. If `r >= s[i]`, `shares` is updated by adding the integer division of `r` by `s[i]` and `r` is updated to the remainder of the division. If `r < s[i]`, `m`, `s`, `b`, and `shares` remain unchanged, and the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
