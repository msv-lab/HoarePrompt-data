According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `m` and `i`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, and `i` is 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, and `i` is 2**
