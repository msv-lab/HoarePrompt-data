Example Answer:
The list `b` is sorted in ascending order. No variables other than `b` are affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000; `b` is a sorted list of integers obtained from input split**
