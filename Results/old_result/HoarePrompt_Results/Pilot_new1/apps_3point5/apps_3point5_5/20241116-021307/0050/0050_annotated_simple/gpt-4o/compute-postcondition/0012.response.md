Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers such that 1 <= n <= 30, 1 <= m <= 30, 1 <= r <= 1000. `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of the list `s`, and `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of list `b`. If `max_sell_price` is less than or equal to `min_buy_price`, the function prints `r`. Otherwise, `max_shares` is calculated as the integer division of `r` by `min_buy_price`, `remaining_bourles` is between 0 and `min_buy_price`, and `total_bourles` is computed as `max_shares * max_sell_price + remaining_bourles`, then the function prints `total_bourles`.***
