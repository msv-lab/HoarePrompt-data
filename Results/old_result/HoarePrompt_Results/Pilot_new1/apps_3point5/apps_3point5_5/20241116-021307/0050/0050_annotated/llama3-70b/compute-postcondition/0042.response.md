According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the range `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, and `i` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to 3 to move to the next iteration.
State: **`r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, and `i` is 3**
