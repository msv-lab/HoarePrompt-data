Postcondition: ***`r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, and `i` is 2. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. Otherwise, if `shares` is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement while maintaining the initial conditions of `r`, `shares`, and `i`.***
