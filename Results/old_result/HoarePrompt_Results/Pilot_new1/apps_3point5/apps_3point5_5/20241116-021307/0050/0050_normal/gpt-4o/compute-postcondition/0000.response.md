Example Answer:
`n`, `m`, and `r` are assigned the values from the input split by space. The values of `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints**
