Example Answer: 
`r` is incremented by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. Since `shares` is 0 and `i` is 2, the value of `b[i]` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, and `i` is 2.
Output State: **`r` is greater than or equal to the smallest value in `s`, `shares` is 0, and `i` is 2**
