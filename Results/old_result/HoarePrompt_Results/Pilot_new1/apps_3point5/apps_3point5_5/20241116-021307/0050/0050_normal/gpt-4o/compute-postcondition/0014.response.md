Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integers `n`, `m`, and `r` from input, along with two lists of integers `s` and `b`. It then calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, the remaining money after buying those shares, and the total money after selling all those shares. Finally, it prints the total money. The function does not have a return value specified.**
