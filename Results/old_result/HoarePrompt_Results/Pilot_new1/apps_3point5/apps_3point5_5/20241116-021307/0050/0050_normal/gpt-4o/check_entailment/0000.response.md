Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It calculates the minimum buy price and the maximum sell price, then determines if it's profitable to buy and sell shares based on these prices. The code handles the scenario where the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price by simply printing the initial amount of bourles. Otherwise, it calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought, the remaining money, and the total money after selling all shares. Finally, it prints the total money. The code seems to cover all possible cases mentioned in the problem description and the output hints also align with the code logic.
