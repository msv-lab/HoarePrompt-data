Example Answer:
The code initializes an empty list `d_queue`. Since no other variables are affected, the output state is: n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue is an empty list.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue is an empty list**
