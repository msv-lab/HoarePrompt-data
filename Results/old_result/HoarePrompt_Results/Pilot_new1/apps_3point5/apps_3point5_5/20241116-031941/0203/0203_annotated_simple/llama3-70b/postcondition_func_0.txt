The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string of characters representing fractions. It then counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R' fractions and prints 'D' if the count of 'D' fractions is greater than the count of 'R' fractions, otherwise it prints 'R'. The function does not explicitly return any value. However, the code does not handle cases where the input is empty or where the input does not consist of only 'D' or 'R' characters.
