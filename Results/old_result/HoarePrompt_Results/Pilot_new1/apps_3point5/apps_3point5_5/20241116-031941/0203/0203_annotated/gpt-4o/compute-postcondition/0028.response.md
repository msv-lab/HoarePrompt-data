Example Answer:
If d_queue is [1, 2, 3] and r_queue is [4, 5], and votes is 'DXXRR', after executing the code, d_index will be assigned the value 1 (popped from d_queue). The states of r_queue, d_queue, r_index, and votes remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: d_queue is [2, 3], r_queue is [4, 5], d_index is 1, r_index is not affected, and votes is 'DXXRR'.
Output State: **d_queue is [2, 3], r_queue is [4, 5], d_index is 1, r_index is not affected, and votes is 'DXXRR'**
