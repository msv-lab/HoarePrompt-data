Example Answer:
`r_index` is assigned the value popped from the front of `r_queue`. The previous values of `r_queue` and `r_index` are dependent on the initial state. If `r_queue` is [2, 4, 6] and `r_index` is 0, after execution, `r_queue` will be [4, 6] and `r_index` will be 2. Therefore, the Output State is: If `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists, `d_index` is the first index from `d_queue`; `r_index` is updated based on the popped value from `r_queue`.
Output State: **If `n` is a positive integer, `votes` is a string of length n, `d_queue` and `r_queue` are lists, `d_index` is the first index from `d_queue`; `r_index` is updated based on the popped value from `r_queue`**
