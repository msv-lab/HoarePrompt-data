Postcondition: ***`d_queue` is [2, 3, 2] or [2, 3], `r_queue` is [5] after the if-else block. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` appends `d_index + n`, otherwise `r_queue` appends `r_index + n`. The values of `d_index`, `r_index`, and `votes` remain unchanged after the execution of the if-else block.***
