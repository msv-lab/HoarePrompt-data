Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given Python program correctly implements the problem description. It reads the number of employees and the fractions they belong to, counts the occurrences of 'D' and 'R', and then determines the outcome of the vote based on the counts. The program follows the voting procedure described in the problem statement where employees take turns making statements and denying others the right to vote until only one employee is left to determine the outcome. The annotations provide a clear explanation of how the code works and the expected behavior at each step. Additionally, the provided examples match the expected output based on the described procedure. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
