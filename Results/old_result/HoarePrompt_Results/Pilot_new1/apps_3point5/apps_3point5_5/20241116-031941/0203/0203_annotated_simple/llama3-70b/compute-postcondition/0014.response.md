According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `fractions` list having at least 3 fractions. At the end of the last iteration, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 2 fractions, and `fraction` is the second fraction in the list. So for the loop to execute one more time, the list must have at least 3 fractions, and `fraction` should be the third fraction in the list. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, input characters are either 'D' or 'R', `depublicans` is either 1 or 2 based on the value of `fraction`, `remocrats` is either 1 or 2 based on the value of `fraction`, `fractions` is a list of fractions with at least 3 fractions, and `fraction` is the third fraction in the list**
