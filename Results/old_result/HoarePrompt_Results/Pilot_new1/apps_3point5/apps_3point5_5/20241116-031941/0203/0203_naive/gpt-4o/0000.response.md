Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program correctly simulates the voting process as described in the problem statement. It maintains separate queues for depublicans and remocrats, and then iterates through the queues based on the order of employee statements. The program correctly handles the scenario where an employee denies another employee's right to vote by adding the denied employee's index to the end of their respective queue. The program continues this process until only one queue is left, indicating the outcome of the vote. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the rules of the voting process described in the problem statement.
