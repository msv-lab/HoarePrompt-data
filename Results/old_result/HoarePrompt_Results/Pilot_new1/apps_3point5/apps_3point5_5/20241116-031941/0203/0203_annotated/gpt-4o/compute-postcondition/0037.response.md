The code appends the result of `r_index + n` to `r_queue`. The initial values are `d_queue` is [3, 2] or [3], `r_queue` is empty, `d_index` is 2, and `r_index` is 5. The value of `n` is not provided, so we cannot calculate the exact result of `r_index + n`. Therefore, the output state is: `d_queue` is [3, 2] or [3], `r_queue` is updated with the result of `r_index + n`, `d_index` is 2, and `r_index` is 5. 
Output State: **`d_queue` is [3, 2] or [3], `r_queue` is updated with the result of `r_index + n`, `d_index` is 2, and `r_index` is 5**
