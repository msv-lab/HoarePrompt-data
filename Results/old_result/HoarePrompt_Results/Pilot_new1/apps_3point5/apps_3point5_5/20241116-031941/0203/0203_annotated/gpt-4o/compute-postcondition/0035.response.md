Example Answer:
r_index is assigned the value popped from r_queue, which is 5. After execution, r_queue becomes empty, and d_queue, d_index remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: d_queue is [3, 2] or [3], r_queue is empty, d_index is 2, r_index is 5.
Output State: **d_queue is [3, 2] or [3], r_queue is empty, d_index is 2, r_index is 5**
