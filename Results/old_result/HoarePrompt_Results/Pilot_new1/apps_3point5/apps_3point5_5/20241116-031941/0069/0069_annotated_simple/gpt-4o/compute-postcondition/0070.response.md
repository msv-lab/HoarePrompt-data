Example Answer:
`count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is `prefix_balances` has more than 1 element, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 5]`, `index` is increased by 6, `count` is incremented by 1.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` has more than 1 element, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 5]`, `index` is increased by 6, `count` is incremented by 1**
