Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data` is a list and `index` is 1. The value at index 1 of `data` is converted to an integer and assigned to `n`. The initial state mentions that `index` is 1, so the value at index 1 of `data` is used. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of `data`.
Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of `data`**
