Example Answer:
`index` is incremented by 3. The previous value of `index` is unknown, so the new value of `index` will be 3 more than the previous value. The values of `n` and `x` are not affected by this operation, so they retain their previous values. The value of `s` is also not affected as it depends on the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data`, `x` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data` incremented by 1, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, and `index` is incremented by 3.
Output State: **`n` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data`, `x` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data` incremented by 1, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 2` in the list `data`, and `index` is incremented by 3**
