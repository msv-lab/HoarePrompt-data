Example Answer:
The value of `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the condition `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. The condition checks if the character at index `i - 1` in string `s` is '0' or not and increments or decrements the balance accordingly. Therefore, the output state is: `balance` is assigned the value of the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in the string `s`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the conditions.
Output State: **`balance` is assigned the value of the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in the string `s`, `i` is 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the conditions**
