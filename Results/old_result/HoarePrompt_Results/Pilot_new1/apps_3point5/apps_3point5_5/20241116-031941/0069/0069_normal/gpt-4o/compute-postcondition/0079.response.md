According to the code, the loop can execute based on the value of `T`. If `T` is greater than 0, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `s` at the corresponding index, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same. So for the loop to execute one more time, `T` must be greater than 0. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `s` at the corresponding index, `i` is incremented by 1, `n` remains the same, `T` is greater than 0**
