Example Answer:
The value at index `index + 2` of `data` is assigned to `s`. The initial values of `index`, `data`, `n`, and `x` are given but the content of `data` is unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of `data`, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of `data`, and `s` is the value at index `index + 2` of `data`.
Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of `data`, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of `data`, and `s` is the value at index `index + 2` of `data`**
