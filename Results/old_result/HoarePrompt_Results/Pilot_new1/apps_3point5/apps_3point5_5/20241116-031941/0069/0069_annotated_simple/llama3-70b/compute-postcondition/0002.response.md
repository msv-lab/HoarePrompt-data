Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values by mapping integers from the input split by space. The input is taken from the user, and the values are converted to integers. The previous value of `T` is not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are input integers.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are input integers**
