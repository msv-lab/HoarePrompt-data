According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `prefix_balances` list. If the list has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `balance` is not equal to 0, `n` is less than 1, `count` is 1. The difference between x and b is divisible by balance and the quotient is non-negative. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `prefix_balances` list must have at least 2 elements.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 2 elements, `balance` is not equal to 0, `n` is less than 1, `count` is 1. The difference between x and b is divisible by balance and the quotient is non-negative**
