Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(result)` prints the value of `result`. Since the initial state mentions that `results` is a list of at least 2 results, we can infer that the list contains multiple values. However, the specific values of the results are unknown. Therefore, the output state is `results` is a list of at least 2 results and one of the results is printed.
Output State: **`results` is a list of at least 2 results and one of the results is printed**
