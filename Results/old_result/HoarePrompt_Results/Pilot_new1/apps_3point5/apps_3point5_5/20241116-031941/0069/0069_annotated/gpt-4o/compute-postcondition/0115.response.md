Postcondition: ***If the string `s` contains at least one character, the loop has executed and updated the `prefix_balances` array. The `balance` variable holds the count of '0's minus the count of '1's in `s`. If `s` is empty, the loop does not execute, and `balance` retains its initial value. If `balance` is 0, the program checks if `x` is in `prefix_balances`. If `x` is present, -1 is appended to `results`; otherwise, 0 is appended. In the else part, `count` represents the number of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the conditions `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0`. If `prefix_balances` is empty, `count` is 0. The postcondition ensures that all possible scenarios are covered, including handling negative values appropriately.***
