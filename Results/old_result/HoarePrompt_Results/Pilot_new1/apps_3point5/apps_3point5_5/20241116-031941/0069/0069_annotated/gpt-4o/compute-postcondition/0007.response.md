Example Answer: 
`x` is assigned the value of the integer at index `index + 1` of `data`. Since `index` is 1, `x` is assigned the integer value at index 2 of `data`. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of `data`, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of `data`.
Output State: **`T` is greater than 0, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of `data`, `x` is the integer value at index 2 of `data`**
