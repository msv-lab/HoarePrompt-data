According to the code, the loop can execute if `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, the following adjustments need to be made for the loop to execute:
State: **`T` is greater than 0, `index` is 4, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value at index 4 of `data`, `x` is the integer value at index 5 of `data`, `s` is the value at index 7 of `data`, `balance` is the result of the subtraction, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n + 1`, `i` is 1**
