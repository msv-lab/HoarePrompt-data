Postcondition: ***`prefix_balances` is a list where each element is calculated based on the previous element and the value of `s` at the corresponding index. `i` is incremented by 1 each iteration, and `n` remains the same. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. If `balance` is equal to 0, the following conditions apply: if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, then -1 is appended to `results`; if `x` is not in `prefix_balances`, then 0 is appended to `results`. In the loop, if the condition `(x - b) % balance == 0` and `(x - b) // balance >= 0` is met for any element `b` in `prefix_balances`, `count` is incremented. After the execution of the if-else block, `results` contains the updated `count` values appended to it if the loop executes; otherwise, `results` remains empty.***
