Example Answer: 
`n` is assigned the value of `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` is an integer value at the index position. The value of `index` is increased by 3, so the next index position will be accessed. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `prefix_balances` list may have been updated, `x` and `results` remain unchanged, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `n` is an integer value.
Output State: **`prefix_balances` list may have been updated, `x` and `results` remain unchanged, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `n` is an integer value**
