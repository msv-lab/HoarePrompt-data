Postcondition: ***After the if-else block, `prefix_balances` list has at least `n + 1` elements. If `n` is less than 1, the loop does not execute and `prefix_balances` remains unchanged. `x` is an integer, `results` list has an additional element appended with -1 if `x` is in `prefix_balances`, otherwise with 0. `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')`, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `n` is an integer value. Each element `prefix_balances[i]` is updated to `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1`. In the case where `balance` is 0, the if part is executed, and the results list is updated accordingly. In the case where `balance` is not equal to 0, the else part is executed, and the results list is updated based on the count of elements in `prefix_balances` that satisfy the given conditions. All edge cases, including the conditions related to `n` and the calculations involving `x`, `balance`, and `prefix_balances`, are covered in the postcondition.***
