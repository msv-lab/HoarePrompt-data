Postcondition: ***`count` is an integer, `prefix_balances` is a list with more elements, `b` is the next element in `prefix_balances`. If the condition (x - b) % balance == 0 and (x - b) // balance >= 0 is satisfied, then `count` is increased by 1. The postcondition covers the scenario where the condition is met and the count is incremented, ensuring that all variables retain their initial types and relationships. Edge cases are also considered, such as the division by zero case and the possibility of negative values, ensuring the correctness of the program's behavior.***
