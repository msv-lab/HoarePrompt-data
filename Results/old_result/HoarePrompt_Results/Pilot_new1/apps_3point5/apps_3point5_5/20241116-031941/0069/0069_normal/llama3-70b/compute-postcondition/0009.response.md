Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, `n` and `x` are assigned values from the input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, and `balance` is the difference between `cnt0` and `cnt1`. The balance is not equal to x. The condition ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0) is satisfied***
