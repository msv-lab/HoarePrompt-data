Postcondition: ***T is greater than 1, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, n and x are assigned positive integer values from the input, cnt0 and cnt1 are assigned the count of '0's and '1's in string s, and balance is the result of subtracting the count of '1's from the count of '0's in string s. If balance equals x, then n + 1 is printed. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) equals 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is calculated and printed. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program fragment.***
