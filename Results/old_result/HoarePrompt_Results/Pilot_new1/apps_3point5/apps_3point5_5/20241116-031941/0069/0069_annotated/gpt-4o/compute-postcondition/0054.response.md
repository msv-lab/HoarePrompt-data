Output State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of `n + 2` zeros, `n` is at least 1, `x` is assigned the integer value at the index position of `data` incremented by 2, `s` is assigned the value at index `index + 5` in the list `data`, `index` is incremented by 3, `i` is incremented by 1, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the condition `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
