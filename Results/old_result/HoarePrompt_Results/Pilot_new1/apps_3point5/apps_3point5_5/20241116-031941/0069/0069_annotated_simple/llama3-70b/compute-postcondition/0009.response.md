Postcondition: **T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer, `cnt0` is the count of '0' characters in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' characters in string `s`. The balance is not equal to `x`. The difference between x and balance is divisible by the difference between cnt0 and cnt1**
