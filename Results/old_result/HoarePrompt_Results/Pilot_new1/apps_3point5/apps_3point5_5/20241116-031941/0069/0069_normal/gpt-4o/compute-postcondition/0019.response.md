Output State: **The loop calculates the cumulative sum of '1's subtracted by the cumulative sum of '0's up to each index in the binary string `s` and stores the result in `prefix_balances`. The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute.**
