According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is updated based on the given formula, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i + 1`.
State: **The list `prefix_balances` is updated, `i` is incremented by 1, and `n` remains the same**
