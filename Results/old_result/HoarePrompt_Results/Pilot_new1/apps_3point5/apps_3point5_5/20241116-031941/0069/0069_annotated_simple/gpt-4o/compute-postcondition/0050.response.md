Output State: **`prefix_balances` is updated based on the calculation `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`, `T` is greater than 0, `n` is greater than 0, `x` and `results` remain unchanged, `s` is assigned the value of `data[index + 2]`, `index` is increased by 3, `balance` is the result of `s.count('0') - s.count('1')**
