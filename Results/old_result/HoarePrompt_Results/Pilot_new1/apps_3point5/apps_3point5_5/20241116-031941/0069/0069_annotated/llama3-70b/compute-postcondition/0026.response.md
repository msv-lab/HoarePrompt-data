Example Answer:
`n` and `x` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The values of `n` and `x` are positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: T is greater than 1, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, n and x are assigned positive integer values from the input.
Output State: **T is greater than 1, n is a positive integer, x is a positive integer, n and x are assigned positive integer values from the input**
