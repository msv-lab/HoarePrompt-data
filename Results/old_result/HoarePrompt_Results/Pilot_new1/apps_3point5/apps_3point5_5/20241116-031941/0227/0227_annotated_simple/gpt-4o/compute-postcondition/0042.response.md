Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If there exists an element `x` in the list `assigned` such that the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is also present in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop breaks. If no such `x` is found in `assigned`, `can_form` remains False. The loop will not execute if the list `assigned` is empty, and `can_form` is False***
