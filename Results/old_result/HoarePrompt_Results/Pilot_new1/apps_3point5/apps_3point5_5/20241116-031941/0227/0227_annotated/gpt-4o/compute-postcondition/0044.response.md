Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1 for each iteration of the loop, and `assigned` still contains at least one element. If `can_form` is True, the loop is terminated, `m` is increased by 1, and `assigned` still contains at least one element.***
