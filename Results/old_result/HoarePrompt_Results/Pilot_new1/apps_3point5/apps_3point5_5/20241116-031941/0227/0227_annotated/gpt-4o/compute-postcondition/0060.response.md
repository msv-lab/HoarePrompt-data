Postcondition: ***`can_form` is a boolean variable. If `a[i] - x` is present in the `assigned` list, `can_form` is True and the loop or if statement is broken. Otherwise, `can_form` remains unchanged. `m` is increased by 1 if `a[i] - x` is present in the `assigned` list. `x` is updated to the next element in the `assigned` list.***
