According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `m` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. Since `n` is greater than 1, it does not guarantee that the loop will execute one more time, so `n` needs to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest positive integer from list `a`, `m` is 2, `n` is greater than 2, and `can_form` is True**
