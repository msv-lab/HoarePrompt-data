Output State: **`can_form` is True if a[i] - x is found in the `assigned` list, `m` is increased by the number of times the condition is met, and `x` is updated to the next element in the `assigned` list. If the condition is never met, `can_form` remains False, and `m` is increased by 1. If the `assigned` list is empty, the loop does not execute, and `can_form` remains False, `m` is increased by 1, and `x` is not updated.**
