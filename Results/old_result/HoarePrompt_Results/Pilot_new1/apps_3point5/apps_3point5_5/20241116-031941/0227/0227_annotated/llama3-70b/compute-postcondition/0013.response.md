Postcondition: ***`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 1, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3 (incremented by 1). If `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1]` multiplied by 2, then `m` is increased by 1. Otherwise, no changes are made to the variables.***
