Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, `assigned` contains the smallest positive integer from list `a`, `m` is 2, `n` is greater than 1. If there exists an element `x` such that `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is True. Otherwise, `can_form` remains False. If there are duplicate elements in `assigned`, the loop may not execute and `can_form` is False**
