Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `n` represents the length of the sequence. Since the initial state specifies that `n` is a positive integer, the output state will be:
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the length of the sequence**
