Example Answer:
The value of `m` is incremented by 1, and the previous value of `m` is known to be greater than or equal to 1. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `m` will be greater than the previous value by 1. The other variables remain unaffected. 
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers sorted in ascending order, `m` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 3 (incremented by 1)**
