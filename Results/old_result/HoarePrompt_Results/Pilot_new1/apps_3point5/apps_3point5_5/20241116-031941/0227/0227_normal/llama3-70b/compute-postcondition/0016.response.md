Output State: **If the list `a` is empty or has only one element, `m` remains 1. If the list `a` has more than one element and each element is twice the value of the previous element, `m` remains 1. Otherwise, `m` is increased by the number of elements in `a` that do not follow the doubling pattern. Finally, `m` is printed if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, -1 is printed.**
