Example Answer: 
The value of `can_form` is set to False. The values of `m` and `assigned` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` still contains at least one element.
Output State: **`can_form` is False, `m` is increased by 1, `assigned` still contains at least one element**
