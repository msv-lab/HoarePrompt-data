The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, a positive integer between 1 and 23, and `a`, a list of `n` distinct positive integers between 1 and 10^9. The function sorts the list `a`, iterates through its elements to check if the difference between any two elements can be found in the list, and counts the number of elements that cannot be formed in such a way. The function then returns this count.
