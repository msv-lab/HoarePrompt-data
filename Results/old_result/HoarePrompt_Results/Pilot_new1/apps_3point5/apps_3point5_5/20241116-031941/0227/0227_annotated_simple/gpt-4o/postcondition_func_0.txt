The function `func_1` accepts a positive integer `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`. It sorts the list `a`, then iterates through the elements to check if each element can form a pair with previously assigned elements. If an element cannot form a pair, the counter `m` is incremented. The function returns the final count of elements that could not form a pair.
