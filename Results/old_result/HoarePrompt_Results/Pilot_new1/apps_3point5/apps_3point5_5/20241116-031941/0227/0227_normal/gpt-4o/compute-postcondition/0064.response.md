Output State: **`a` is a list of `n` distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order with at least 2 elements. `assigned` may or may not contain the current element `x`. `m` is increased by 1. `n` remains greater than 2. `i` remains less than `n-1`. `can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` and any element `x` in `assigned` is found, otherwise `can_form` is False.**
