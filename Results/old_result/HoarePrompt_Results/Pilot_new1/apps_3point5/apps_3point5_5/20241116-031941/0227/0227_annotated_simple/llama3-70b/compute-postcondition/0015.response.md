Output State: **If the element at index `i` in list `a` is not twice the value of the element at index `i-1` for any `i` between 1 and n-1, then `m` will be the count of such occurrences. Otherwise, `m` will remain 0. `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 23, `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order.**
