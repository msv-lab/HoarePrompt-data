Example Answer:
The code calculates the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` and assigns it to `min_walk_time`. The values of `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time` are not provided in the initial state, so the output state will depend on those values.
Output State: **Dependent on the values of direct_walk_time and reverse_walk_time**
