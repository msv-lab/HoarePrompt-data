Example Answer: 
`floor` is assigned the value of `floor_within_block // k + 1`. The value of `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`, where `apartment` is not given. Since `block`, `m`, and `k` are not provided, the specific value of `floor` cannot be determined. Therefore, the Output State is: `block` is a positive integer, `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`.
Output State: **`block` is a positive integer, `floor_within_block` is calculated as `(apartment - 1) % (m * k)`**
