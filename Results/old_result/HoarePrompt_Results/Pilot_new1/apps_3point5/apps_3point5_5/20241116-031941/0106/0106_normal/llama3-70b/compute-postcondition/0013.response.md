The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns a tuple containing three elements: the sum of `n`, `m`, and `k`, the product of `n`, `m`, and `k`, and the maximum value between `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate the sum and product of `n`, `m`, and `k`, as well as return the maximum value between `a` and `b`.
