Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts positive integers `n, m, k, a, b` representing certain constraints. It determines the location of apartments `a` and `b`, calculates the total time required to move from apartment `a` to apartment `b`, considering walking distances and floor changes. The total time is calculated based on `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. However, the code does not handle edge cases where the values of `n, m, k, a, b` do not meet the specified constraints. Additionally, the code does not consider scenarios where apartment `a` and apartment `b` are the same.**
