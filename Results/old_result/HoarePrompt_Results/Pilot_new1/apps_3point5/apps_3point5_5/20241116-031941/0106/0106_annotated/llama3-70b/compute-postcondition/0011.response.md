Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers within the specified range. `a` and `b` are integers from the input. `a_floor` is a new calculated value based on the input values of `a`. `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula `b_floor = (b - 1) % m + 1`. `b_block` is calculated based on the provided formula. `min_block_time` is the minimum time calculated based on the formula `min_block_time = min(abs(a_block - b_block), n - abs(a_block - b_block)) * 15`. If `a_floor` is greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(a_floor - b_floor) * 5 + 10`. If `a_floor` is not greater than `b_floor`, `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program execution.***
