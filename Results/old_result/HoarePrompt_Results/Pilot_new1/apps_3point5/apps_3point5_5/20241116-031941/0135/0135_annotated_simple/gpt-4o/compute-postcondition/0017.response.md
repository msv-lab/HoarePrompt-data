Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two integers `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 
- Case 1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'.
- Case 2: If k is less than n, the function checks for repeated remainders when `n` is divided by numbers from 1 to k. If a repeated remainder is found, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.
- Edge Case: If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and the function does not check for remainders.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to determine if there are repeated remainders when n is divided by numbers from 1 to k and return 'No' if any are found, otherwise return 'Yes'.**
