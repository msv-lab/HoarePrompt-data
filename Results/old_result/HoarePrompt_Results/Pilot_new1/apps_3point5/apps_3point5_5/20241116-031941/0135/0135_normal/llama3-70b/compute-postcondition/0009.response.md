According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1 and `k` is an input integer. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented and adjusted to 2.
State: **`n`, `k` are input integers, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is 0**
