Example Answer:
The code snippet prints 'No' and does not modify any of the existing variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`n`, `k`, `i` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18; `i` is equal to `k + 1`; `remainder` is the calculated remainder of `n` divided by `i`; `seen` contains the newly added `remainder`**
