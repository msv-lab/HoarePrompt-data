The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function returns the result of the expression `n + k`. The input parameters `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to return the sum of the integers `n` and `k`. 
Functionality: **The function returns the sum of the integers `n` and `k`, where n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18.**
