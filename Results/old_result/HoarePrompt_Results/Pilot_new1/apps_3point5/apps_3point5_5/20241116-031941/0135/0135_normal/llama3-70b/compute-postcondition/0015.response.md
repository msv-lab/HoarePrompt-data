According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n`, `k` are input integers, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2. If the value of `remainder` is already in `seen`, then the program prints 'No' and exits. Otherwise, `seen` is updated to include the new `remainder`, and there are no changes to `n`, `k`, `i`, and `seen` after the execution of the if statement. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n`, `k` are input integers, `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of dividing `n` by 2**
