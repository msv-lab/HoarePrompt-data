According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is greater than or equal to 1. Since `k` is an integer within the range 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, it satisfies the condition for the loop to execute. Therefore, no adjustments are needed for the loop to execute.

State: **`n` and `k` are integers within the range 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18**
