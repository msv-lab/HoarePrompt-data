According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. Since `i` is 1 and `k` is 1, the loop can execute one more time. No adjustments are needed in this case.
State: **`n` is 1, `k` is 1, `i` is 2, `remainder` is 0**
