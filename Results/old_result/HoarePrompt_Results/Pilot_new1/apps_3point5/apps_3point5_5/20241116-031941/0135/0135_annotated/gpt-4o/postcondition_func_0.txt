The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 
- Case 1: If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'. 
- Case 2: If k is less than n, the function iterates from 1 to k, calculating the remainder of n divided by i. If any remainder is already in seen_remainders, the function returns 'No'. If no repeated remainder is found, the function returns 'Yes'.
Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to determine whether there are repeated remainders when dividing n by numbers from 1 to k, returning 'Yes' if there are no repeats and 'No' if there are.
