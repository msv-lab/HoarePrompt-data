Functionality: The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, where both `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 
- If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns the string 'No'.
- If k is less than n, the function iterates through values from 1 to k inclusive, calculating the remainder of n divided by each value. If any remainder is already seen, it returns 'No'. If no repeated remainders are found, it returns 'Yes'.
- If k is less than 1, the loop does not execute, and there is no change in the values of n, k, i, and remainder.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to determine whether there are repeated remainders when dividing n by values from 1 to k. It returns 'Yes' if there are no repeated remainders, 'No' if there are, and handles the edge case where k is greater than or equal to n.
