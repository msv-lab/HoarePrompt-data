Example Answer:
The remainder is calculated by taking the modulo of `n` and `i`, where `n` and `i` are input integers and `i` is 1. Since `i` is 1, the remainder will always be 0. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, remainder is 0.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are input integers, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1, remainder is 0**
