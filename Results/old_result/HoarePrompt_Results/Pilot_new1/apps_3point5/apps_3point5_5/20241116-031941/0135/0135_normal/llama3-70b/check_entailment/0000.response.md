Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input.
- It then iterates through numbers from 1 to `k`, calculating the remainder of `n` divided by each number.
- If a repeated remainder is found, it prints 'No' and exits.
- If no repeated remainder is found, it prints 'Yes'.
- The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases.
- It handles the case where there are no repeated remainders and prints 'Yes' in that scenario.
- It also correctly identifies the case where there are repeated remainders and prints 'No'.
