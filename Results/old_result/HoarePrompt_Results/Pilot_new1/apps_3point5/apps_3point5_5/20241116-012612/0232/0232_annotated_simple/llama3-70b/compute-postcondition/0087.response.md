Example Answer:
`window_counts` is initialized as an empty dictionary. No other variables are affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: If n is greater than i + 1, `j` is equal to the final value of i plus the number of iterations, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, and `found` is True if all counts match the desired counts.
Output State: **If n is greater than i + 1, `j` is equal to the final value of i plus the number of iterations, `window_counts` is an empty dictionary, and `found` is True if all counts match the desired counts.**
