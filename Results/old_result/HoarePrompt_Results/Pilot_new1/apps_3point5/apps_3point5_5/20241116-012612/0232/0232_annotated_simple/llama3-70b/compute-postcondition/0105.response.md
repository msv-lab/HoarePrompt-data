Postcondition: ***If the color is not in window_counts, it is added with a value of 1. If the color is already present in window_counts, its value is incremented by 1. If all counts in the sorted window_counts match the corresponding counts in the counts list, found is set to True and the loop breaks. This postcondition covers both scenarios of adding a new color and incrementing the count of an existing color in window_counts, ensuring that the loop terminates correctly based on the condition check.***
