Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable indicating whether the target counts are found in `window_counts`. `i` is an integer with a value of 1. `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 1. `j` is equal to `i`. `window_counts` is a dictionary containing the color as a key and its count as a value, with the count of `color` incremented by 1 if `color` was already present in `window_counts`. `color` is the color at index `j` in the list `colors`. If all the values in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding values in `counts` after sorting, then `found` is set to True and the loop breaks.***
