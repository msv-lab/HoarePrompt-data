According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is equal to `n`. So for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`If the color is not in window_counts, it is added with a value of 1. If the color is already present in window_counts, its value is incremented by 1. If all counts in the sorted window_counts match the corresponding counts in the counts list, found is set to True and the loop breaks.`**
