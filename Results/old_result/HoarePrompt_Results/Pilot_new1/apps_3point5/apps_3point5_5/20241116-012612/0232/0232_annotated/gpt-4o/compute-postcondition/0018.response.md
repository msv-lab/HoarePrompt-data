According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `right` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `desired_counts` and `current_counts` need to be checked to determine if the loop should execute again. If there is at least one color with a desired count greater than the current count, `right` is incremented by 1. Therefore, if there is at least one color with a desired count greater than the current count at the end of the previous iteration, `right` should be adjusted by incrementing it by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **If there is at least one color with a desired count greater than the current count, `right` is incremented by 1. `desired_counts`, `current_counts`, `left`, `right`, and `n` remain the same.**
