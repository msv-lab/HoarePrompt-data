Example Answer:
The count of the color at index `right` in the `colors` list is incremented by 1 in the `current_counts` dictionary. The values of `current_counts`, `left`, and `right` are updated based on the previous state. Therefore, the Output State is: `current_counts` updated, `left` incremented, `right` is less than `n+1`, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`current_counts` updated, `left` incremented, `right` is less than `n+1`, `n` is greater than 0**
