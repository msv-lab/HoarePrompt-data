Output State: **`found` is False, `i` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, `j` is equal to `i`, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` key and value 1 if `color` was not previously in `window_counts`. If `color` was already in `window_counts`, the state remains unchanged with the same initial conditions.**
