Output State: **The loop iterates through the list of colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight. If a color is not already in the color_counts dictionary, it adds the color as a key with a value of 0, then increments the value by 1. The final state includes n as the number of Jedi Knights, m as the number of possible colors of lightsabers, colors as a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers, counts as a list of m integers representing desired counts of lightsabers, and color_counts as a dictionary where each color is a key and its value is the count of that color. If the colors list is empty, the loop does not execute and color_counts remains an empty dictionary.**
