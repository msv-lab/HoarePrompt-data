Example Answer:
`current_counts` is initialized as a defaultdict with integer values set to 0. The dictionary `desired_counts` is not affected by this initialization. Therefore, the Output State is: desired_counts is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to m and values are taken from the list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with integer values set to 0.
Output State: **desired_counts is a dictionary where keys are integers from 1 to m and values are taken from the list k; current_counts is a defaultdict with integer values set to 0**
