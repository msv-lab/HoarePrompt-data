Output State: **If `i` is less than `n`, the loop increments the count of each color in `window_counts` based on the colors in the `colors` list up to index `j`. If the color at index `j` is not in `window_counts`, it is added with a count of 1. The loop continues until all color counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding counts in `counts`, at which point `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute and `window_counts` remains an empty dictionary, and `found` stays False.**
