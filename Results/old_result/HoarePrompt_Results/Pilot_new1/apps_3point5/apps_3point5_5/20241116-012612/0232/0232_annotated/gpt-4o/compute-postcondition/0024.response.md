Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts parameters `n`, `m`, `colors`, and `k`. It iterates through the colors list, updating the counts of each color in `current_counts`. If all colors in `desired_counts` have their desired counts equal to their current counts, it returns 'YES'. If not, it returns 'NO'. If some colors have desired counts greater than their current counts, the function continues the iteration. If there are no colors in `desired_counts` or `n` is 0, the function returns 'NO'. **
