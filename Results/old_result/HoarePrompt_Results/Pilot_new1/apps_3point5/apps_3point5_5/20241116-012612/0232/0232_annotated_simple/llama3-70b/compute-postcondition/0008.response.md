Example Answer:
The code increments the count of a specific color in the `color_counts` dictionary by 1 based on the input color. The value of `color` is not provided in the initial state, so the output state will be: n is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is an integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight with at least one color, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color entered through input, color_counts is a dictionary where color is the key and its value is 1.
Output State: **n is an integer representing the number of Jedi Knights, m is an integer representing the number of possible colors of lightsabers, colors is a list of n integers representing the colors of lightsabers of each Jedi Knight with at least one color, counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color entered through input, color_counts is a dictionary where color is the key and its value is 1**
