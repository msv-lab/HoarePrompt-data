Example Answer:
`window_counts` is assigned the value 0 for the key `color`. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 1. The previous values of the variables are not given, so the output state is: `window_counts` has a key `color` with a value of 0 or 1.
Output State: **`window_counts` has a key `color` with a value of 0 or 1**
