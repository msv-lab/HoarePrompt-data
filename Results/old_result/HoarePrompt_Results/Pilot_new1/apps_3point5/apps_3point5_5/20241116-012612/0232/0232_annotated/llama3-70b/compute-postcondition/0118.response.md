Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable that is True if all counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`. `i` remains 2, `n` remains an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `j` is equal to `n`. `window_counts` is updated with the count of the color `color`, where `color` is the color at index `n - 1` in the list `colors`. If `color` was not present in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is reset to 0 and then incremented by 1. If `n` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and `found` remains False.***
