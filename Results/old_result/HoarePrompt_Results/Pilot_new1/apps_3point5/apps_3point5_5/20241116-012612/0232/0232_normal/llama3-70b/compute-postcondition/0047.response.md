Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if statement, `n` is 1 or greater, `found` is True, `window_counts` is a dictionary with `color` set to 0 if `color` was not already in `window_counts`, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, and `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement.***
