Output State: **If all values in `current_counts` for each color match the corresponding values in `desired_counts`, the function returns 'YES'. Otherwise, `left` increments until the condition is no longer met, `current_counts` is updated accordingly, `right` remains 0, `n` is greater than 0. If the loop never starts due to initial conditions not meeting the loop's criteria, the variables remain unchanged.**
