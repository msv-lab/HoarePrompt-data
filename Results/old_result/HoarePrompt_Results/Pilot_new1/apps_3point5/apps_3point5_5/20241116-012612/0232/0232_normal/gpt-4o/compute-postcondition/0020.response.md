According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `right` and `n`. If `right` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `current_counts` is updated, `left` is incremented, `right` is less than `n+1`, `n` is greater than 0. Since `right` is the looping variable and it needs to be adjusted for the next iteration, it should be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`current_counts` updated, `left` incremented, `right` is less than `n+1`, `n` is greater than 0, `right` is incremented by 1**
