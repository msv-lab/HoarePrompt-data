Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 1, `m` is the number of possible colors of lightsabers, `colors` is a list of colors, `counts` is a list of desired counts of lightsabers, `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their counts, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `i + 2`, `n` is greater than `j`, `window_counts` is a dictionary with the color not in it, `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 3, `found` is True. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. If all the counts in `window_counts` match the desired counts in `counts`, then `found` is set to True and the loop is broken. This encompasses all possible cases and edge scenarios after the execution of the if statement.***
