Example Answer:
`current_counts` is initialized as a defaultdict with integer values. Since no calculations or changes are made to the existing variables, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **Precondition: n and m are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 100 and 1 ≤ m ≤ n. colors is a list of n integers in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. k is a list of m integers such that 1 ≤ Σ_{i=1}^{m} k_{i} ≤ n. desired_counts is a dictionary mapping integers from 1 to m to corresponding elements from the list k. `current_counts` is a defaultdict with integer values**
