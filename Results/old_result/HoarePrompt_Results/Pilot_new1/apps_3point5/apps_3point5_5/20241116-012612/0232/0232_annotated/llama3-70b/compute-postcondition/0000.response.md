Example Answer:
`n` and `m` are assigned values based on the input split by space. The values of `n` and `m` are positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: **n and m are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n. colors is a list of n integers representing colors of the lightsabers, with each color in the range {1, 2, ..., m}. counts is a list of m integers representing the desired counts of lightsabers of each color, with the sum of all counts being at least 1 and at most n.**
