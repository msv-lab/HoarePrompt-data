Example Answer:
`current_counts` is assigned a new defaultdict with the default value of 0. The previous value of `current_counts` is unknown, so the output state is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0**
