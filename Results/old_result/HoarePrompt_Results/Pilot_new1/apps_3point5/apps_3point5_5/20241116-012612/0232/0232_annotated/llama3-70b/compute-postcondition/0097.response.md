Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in the `counts` list after being sorted, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. `i` remains 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `window_counts` is a dictionary containing the color as a key and its count as a value, with the count of `color` incremented by 1 if `color` was already present in `window_counts`, `color` is the color at index `n - 1` in the list `colors`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. If `color` is not already a key in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0.***
