Example Answer:
The variable `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, where `j` is equal to `i`. The value of `j` is the same as `i`, so `color` is assigned the value at index `i` in the list `colors`. The value of `n` is greater than or equal to `i`, so there is no change in the state of `window_counts`, `i`, or `n`. 
Output State: **`window_counts` is an empty dictionary, `i` is equal to `j`, `n` is greater than or equal to `i`**
