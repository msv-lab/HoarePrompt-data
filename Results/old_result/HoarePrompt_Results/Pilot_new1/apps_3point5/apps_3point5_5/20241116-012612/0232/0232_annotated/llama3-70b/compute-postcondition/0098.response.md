According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `i` remains 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `n - 1`, `window_counts` is updated with the count of `color`, `color` is the color at index `n - 1` in the list `colors`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to `n`.
State: **`found` is a boolean variable, `i` remains 2, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `j` is equal to `n`, `window_counts` is updated with the count of `color`, `color` is the color at index `n - 1` in the list `colors`, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`.**
