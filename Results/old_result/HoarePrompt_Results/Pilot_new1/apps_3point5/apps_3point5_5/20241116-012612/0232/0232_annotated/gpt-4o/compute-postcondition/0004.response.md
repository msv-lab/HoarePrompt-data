Example Answer:
The value of `current_counts[colors[right]]` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `desired_counts`, `current_counts`, `left`, `right`, and `n` are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their desired counts, `current_counts` is a defaultdict with a default value of 0, `left` is 0, `right` is 0, `n` is greater than 0**
