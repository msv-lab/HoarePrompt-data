Example Answer:
The variable `found` is assigned the value `True`. This assignment does not affect any other variables in the initial state. Therefore, the Output State is: `If the color is not in window_counts, it is added with a value of 1. If the color is already present in window_counts, its value is incremented by 1.` and `found` is True.
Output State: **If the color is not in window_counts, it is added with a value of 1. If the color is already present in window_counts, its value is incremented by 1. found is True**
