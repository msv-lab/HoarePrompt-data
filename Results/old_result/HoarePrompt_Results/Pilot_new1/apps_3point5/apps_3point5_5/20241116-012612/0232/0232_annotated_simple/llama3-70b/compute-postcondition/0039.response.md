Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `m` is the number of possible colors of lightsabers, `colors` is a list of colors, `counts` is a list of desired counts of lightsabers, `color_counts` is a dictionary mapping colors to their counts, `i` is 0, `j` is equal to `i + 1`, `n` is greater than `j`, `window_counts` is a dictionary with the color not in it, `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 2. If all the counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding counts in the `counts` list, `found` is set to True, and the loop is exited. If the color is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0. This covers all possible scenarios and edge cases of the program after the if statement executes.***
