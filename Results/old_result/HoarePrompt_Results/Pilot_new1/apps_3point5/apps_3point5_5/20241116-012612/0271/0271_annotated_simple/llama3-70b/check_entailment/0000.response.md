Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided code correctly implements the logic to round a non-negative integer to the nearest integer that ends with 0, as described in the problem statement. The code handles all possible cases and edge cases, ensuring that the output is correct for any given input within the specified constraints. The annotations in the code also accurately describe the logic and the postconditions after the if-else blocks have been executed. 
Therefore, based on the code logic and the problem description, the correctness of the program is true for all potential cases.
