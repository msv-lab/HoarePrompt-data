Example Answer: 
The code calculates n - n % 10, where n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, n is not divisible by 10, and the remainder of n divided by 10 is less than or equal to 5. This expression effectively removes the last digit of n by subtracting the remainder of n divided by 10 from n. As n is not divisible by 10 and the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the last digit is less than or equal to 5. Therefore, the output state is: n is a non-negative integer satisfying the given conditions.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer satisfying the given conditions**
