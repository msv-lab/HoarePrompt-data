Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is the result of subtracting `remainder` from `n`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is the sum of `n` and the difference between 10 and `remainder`.***
