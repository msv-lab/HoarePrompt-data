Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9; `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9. If `remainder` is less than or equal to 5, `result` is equal to the subtraction of `remainder` from `n`. If `remainder` is greater than 5, `result` is equal to the sum of `n` and (10 - `remainder`). The value of `result` is printed.**
