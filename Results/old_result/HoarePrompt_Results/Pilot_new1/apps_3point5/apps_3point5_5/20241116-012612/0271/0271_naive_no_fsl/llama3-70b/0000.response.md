Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the number ends with 0, if so, it prints the number as is. If the last digit is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest integer ending with 0. If the last digit is greater than 5, it rounds up to the nearest integer ending with 0. Therefore, the program is correct and meets all the requirements specified in the problem description.
