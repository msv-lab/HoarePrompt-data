Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is divisible by 10, the program prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, the program checks the remainder of `n` divided by 10. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the program prints `n` minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10. If the remainder is greater than 5, the program prints `n` plus 10 minus the remainder of `n` divided by 10. This covers all possible cases for the execution of the if else block.***
