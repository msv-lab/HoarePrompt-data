Example Answer:
`candidate` is assigned the value of `perm` joined together. Since `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be the characters of `chars` rearranged in the first permutation order. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is not an empty string, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of n, `candidate` is the first permutation of `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is not an empty string, `perm` is the first permutation of `chars`, `sub` is a string representing a substring of n, `candidate` is the first permutation of `chars`**
