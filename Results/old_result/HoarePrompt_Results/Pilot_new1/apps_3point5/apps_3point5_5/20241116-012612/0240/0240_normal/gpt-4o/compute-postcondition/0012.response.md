Postcondition: ***`chars` still contains at least 1 character, `sub` represents a different substring of the number, `candidate` is a string formed by joining `perm`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` is true, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. Ensure that the conditions stated in the precondition are maintained after the execution of the if else block.***
