Example Answer:
The set `t_set` is assigned the set of characters in string `t`. The values of `s` and `t` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` is a string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of string `t`**.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of string `t`**
