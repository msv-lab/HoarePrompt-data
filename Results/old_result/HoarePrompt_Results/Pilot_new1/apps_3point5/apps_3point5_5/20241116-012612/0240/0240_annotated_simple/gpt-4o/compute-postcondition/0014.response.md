Output State: **`candidate` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`. If `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program. If the list `perm` is empty, the loop does not execute and no action is taken.**
