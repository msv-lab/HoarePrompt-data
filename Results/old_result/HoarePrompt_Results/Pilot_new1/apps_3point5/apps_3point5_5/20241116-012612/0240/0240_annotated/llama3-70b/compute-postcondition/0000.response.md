Example Answer:
The set `t_set` is assigned the set of unique characters in string `t`. The previous values of `t_set` are unknown, but since `t` is a string, `t_set` will contain all unique characters present in `t`. Therefore, the Output State is: **`s` and `t` are strings, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters in `t`**.
Output State: **`s` and `t` are strings, `t_set` is a set containing unique characters in `t`**
