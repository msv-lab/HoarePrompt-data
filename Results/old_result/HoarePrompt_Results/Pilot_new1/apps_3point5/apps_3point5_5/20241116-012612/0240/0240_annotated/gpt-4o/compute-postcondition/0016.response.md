Functionality: **The function `generate_possible_numbers` takes two parameters: `chars`, a string representing a sequence of digits, and `sub`, a string representing a substring of `chars`. It generates permutations of `chars` and yields those permutations as `candidate` if they are valid numbers based on the `is_valid_number` function with the substring `sub`. If `chars` is empty or `sub` is not a substring of `chars`, the function does not execute the loop. The function does not have a specific return value.**
