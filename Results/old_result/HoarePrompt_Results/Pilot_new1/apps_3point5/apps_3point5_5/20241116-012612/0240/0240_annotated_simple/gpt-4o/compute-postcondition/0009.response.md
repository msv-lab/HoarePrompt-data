According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the result of `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` where `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`. If the result is True, `candidate` is yielded. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`. To execute the loop one more time, the state should ensure that `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` evaluates to True.

State: **`candidate` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`.**
