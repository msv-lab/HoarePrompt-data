According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the permutations of `chars`. If there are more permutations left, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is a string. The key point here is the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`. If this function returns true, then the loop will yield `candidate`. So, for the loop to execute one more time, `candidate` should be a valid number based on the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`candidate` is a valid number string**
