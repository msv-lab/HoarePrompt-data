According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `perm` and the validity of `candidate` as a number. If `candidate` is a valid number, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `candidate` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the list `perm`. If `candidate` is a valid number according to the function `is_valid_number` with respect to `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next `perm` needs to be considered. The `perm` list should be modified to the next permutation in order for the loop to execute again. Additionally, the `candidate` needs to be checked for validity with respect to `sub` for the next iteration.

State: **`candidate` is a string obtained by joining the elements of the next permutation of `chars`, if `candidate` is a valid number according to the function `is_valid_number` with respect to `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`.**
