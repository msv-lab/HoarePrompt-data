Postcondition: ***`chars` contains at least 1 character, `sub` is a string representing a substring of a number, and `candidate` is the result of joining the elements of `perm`. If the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)` returns true, then the function yields `candidate`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables. Ensure that all edge cases, such as different possible outcomes of `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, are handled appropriately.***
