Example Answer:
`x, y, z` are assigned values based on the input split. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. Therefore, the Output State is: `x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100**
