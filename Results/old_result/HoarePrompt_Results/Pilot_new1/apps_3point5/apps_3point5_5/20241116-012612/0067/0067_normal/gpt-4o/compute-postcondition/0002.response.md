Example Answer:
`max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, where `x` and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, z <= 100. Therefore, `max_upvotes` will be between 0 and 200. The values of `y` and `min_upvotes` are not affected by this assignment.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` is between 0 and 200**
