Example Answer:
`max_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x + z`, where `x` is the value of `min_upvotes` and `z` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100. Therefore, `max_upvotes` will be between `min_upvotes` and `min_upvotes + 100`. The values of `x`, `y`, and `z` are not changed. 
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers between 0 and 100, `min_upvotes` is assigned the value of `x`, `max_upvotes` is between `min_upvotes` and `min_upvotes + 100**
