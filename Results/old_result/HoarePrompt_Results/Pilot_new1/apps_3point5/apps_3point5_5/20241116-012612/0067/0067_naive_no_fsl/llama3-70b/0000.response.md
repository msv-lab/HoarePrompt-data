Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. It checks if the number of upvotes is greater than the sum of downvotes and unknown votes, then prints "+", if the number of downvotes is greater than upvotes, then prints "-", if the number of upvotes is equal to downvotes and there are no unknown votes, then prints "0", and if there are unknown votes, then prints "?". The logic covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement.
