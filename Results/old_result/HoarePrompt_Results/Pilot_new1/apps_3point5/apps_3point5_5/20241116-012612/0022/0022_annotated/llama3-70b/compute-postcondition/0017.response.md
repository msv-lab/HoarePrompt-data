Output State: `s` is a string input by the user with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_spalindrome` is True if the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` in `s` are the same for all valid `i` values. If at any point `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, `is_spalindrome` is set to False. If the length of `s` is less than 2, the loop does not execute and `is_spalindrome` remains True. If the length of `s` is even, the loop executes n/2 times; if the length of `s` is odd, the loop executes (n-1)/2 times.**
