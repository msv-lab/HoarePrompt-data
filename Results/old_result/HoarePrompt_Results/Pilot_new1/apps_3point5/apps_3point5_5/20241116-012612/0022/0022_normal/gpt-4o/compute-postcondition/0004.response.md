Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 0. If the character at index `i` of `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, then the function returns False. This condition covers all cases where the characters at the symmetric positions in the string `s` are not equal.***
