Example Answer:
The length of the string `s` is calculated using the `len()` function and assigned to `n`. The value of `n` is the length of the input string `s`. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of the string `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of the string `s`**
