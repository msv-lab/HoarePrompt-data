Example Answer:
The variable `is_spalindrome` is assigned the boolean value `True`. The other variables `s` and `n` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `is_spalindrome` is True.
Output State: **`s` is a string input by the user, `n` is the length of the string `s`, `is_spalindrome` is True**
