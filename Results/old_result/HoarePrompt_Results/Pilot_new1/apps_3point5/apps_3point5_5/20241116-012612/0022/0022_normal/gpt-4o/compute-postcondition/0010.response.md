Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2. If the character at index `i` in `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. This condition covers all cases where the characters at the specified indices are not equal, ensuring the integrity of the string comparison logic.***
