Postcondition: ***`s` is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000, `n` is at least 2, `i` is 1. If the character at index `i` in string `s` is not equal to the character at index `n - 1 - i`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables `s`, `n`, and `i`.***
