According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 3. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the last iteration, which is `i + 1`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string of English letters with a length of at least 2, `n` is greater than or equal to 3, `i` is the next value after the last iteration**
