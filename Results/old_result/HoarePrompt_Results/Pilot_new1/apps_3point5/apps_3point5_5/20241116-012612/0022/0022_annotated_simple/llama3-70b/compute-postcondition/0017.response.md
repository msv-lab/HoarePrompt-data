Output State: **If the string `s` is a palindrome, `is_spalindrome` remains True after the loop executes. If `s` is not a palindrome, `is_spalindrome` is set to False. The loop executes for half the length of the string `s` unless it breaks due to a mismatch in characters. If the length of `s` is less than 2, the loop does not execute.**
