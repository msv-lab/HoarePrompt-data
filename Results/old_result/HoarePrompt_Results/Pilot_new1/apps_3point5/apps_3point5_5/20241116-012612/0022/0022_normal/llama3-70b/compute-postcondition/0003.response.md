According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is at least 2. Since `n` is an integer between 1 and 1000, the loop will execute if `n` is 2 or greater. Before the loop starts, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, so it needs to be adjusted to reflect that `n` is 2 or greater and `i` is 0.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000 inclusive, `n` is 2 or greater, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is 0**
