Postcondition: ***`s` is a string input by the user with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_spalindrome` is True if the characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` in `s` are the same for all valid `i` values. If there exists a pair of characters at positions `i` and `n - i - 1` that are different, `is_spalindrome` is set to False, `i` is incremented by 1, and the loop or if statement is exited.***
