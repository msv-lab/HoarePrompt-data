The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `s`, which is a string of English letters with a length between 1 and 1000. It iterates through the string to check if the characters at symmetric positions are equal. If any pair of characters is not equal, the function returns False. If all pairs of characters are equal, the function returns True. If the length of the string is less than 2, the function returns True immediately.
