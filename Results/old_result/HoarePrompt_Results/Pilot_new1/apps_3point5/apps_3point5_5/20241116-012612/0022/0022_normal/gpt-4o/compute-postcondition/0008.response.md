According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is 1. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`s` is a string, `n` is an integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
