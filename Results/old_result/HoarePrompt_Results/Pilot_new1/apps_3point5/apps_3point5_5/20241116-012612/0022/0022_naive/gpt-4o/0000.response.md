Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program correctly checks if a string is an "s-palindrome" by iterating through the first half of the string and comparing each character with its mirror reflection in the second half. If at any point a mismatch is found, it returns False indicating that the string is not an "s-palindrome". Otherwise, it returns True. The program handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement, making it correct.
