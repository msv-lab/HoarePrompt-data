Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from input splitting. If `c` is equal to 0, the program prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b`, otherwise it prints 'NO'. If `c` is not equal to 0, then the program checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division is non-negative. If the condition is met, 'YES' is printed, otherwise 'NO' is printed. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios, ensuring that the program outputs the correct response based on the given input values.***
