Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers obtained from input splitting. `c` is not equal to 0. If the condition ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, 'YES' is printed. If the condition is false, 'NO' is printed. In all cases, the program ensures that the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division is non-negative.***
