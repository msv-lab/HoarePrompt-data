Functionality: **The function takes three integer inputs a, b, and c, and based on their values, it prints 'YES' or 'NO' following specific conditions. If b is equal to a, it prints 'YES'. If b is not equal to a, it checks the value of c. If c is 0, it prints 'NO'. If c is not 0, it further checks if ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true; if so, it prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO'. The function covers all scenarios based on the input values of a, b, and c to determine the correct output.**
