Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads in three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` which represent the first element of the sequence, Vasya's favorite number, and the difference between any two neighboring elements of the sequence, respectively.
- If `c` is 0, the code checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if they are equal, otherwise it prints 'NO', which aligns with the problem description.
- If `c` is not 0, the code checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result of the division is non-negative. If this condition is met, it prints 'YES'; otherwise, it prints 'NO', which also follows the problem description.
- The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
