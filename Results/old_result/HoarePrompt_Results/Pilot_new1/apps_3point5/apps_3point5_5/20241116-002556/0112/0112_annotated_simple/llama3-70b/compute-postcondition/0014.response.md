Example Answer:
If '0' was present in the set `digits`, it is removed. The set `digits` is then sorted in reverse order and joined to form a string which is then converted to an integer and assigned to `max_num`. If '0' was not present initially, the set remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: The set `digits` has been updated and `max_num` is assigned the maximum number formed by the remaining digits in `digits`.
Output State: **The set `digits` is updated based on the removal of '0', and `max_num` is assigned the maximum number formed by the remaining digits in `digits`**
