According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the `digits` list and the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]`. If the condition is satisfied for at least one element, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, all elements in the list `used_cubes` have been updated based on the condition, `digits` still has at least 1 element, `found` is True if the condition is satisfied for at least one element, `n` remains greater than 0, and `i` is adjusted accordingly for the next iteration after the if-else block executes. If the condition is never met for any element in the loop, `found` remains False. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- If `found` is True, then the loop will execute again. Adjust `found` to True.
- Adjust `digits` to have at least 1 element.
- Adjust `n` to remain greater than 0.
- Adjust `i` accordingly for the next iteration after the if-else block executes.

State: **All elements in the list `used_cubes` are updated, `digits` still has at least 1 element, `found` is True, `n` remains greater than 0, and `i` is adjusted accordingly**
