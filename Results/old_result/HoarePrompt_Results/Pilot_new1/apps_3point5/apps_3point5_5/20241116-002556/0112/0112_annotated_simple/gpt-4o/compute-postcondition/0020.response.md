According to the code, the loop can execute again if the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is not satisfied. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values with length `n` where all elements are the same as before except `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, `digits` is non-empty, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `found` is True, `i` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` must not be satisfied, so `used_cubes[i]` should be set to `False`. All other variables retain their initial values.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values with length `n` where all elements are the same as before except `used_cubes[i]` is set to `False`, `digits` is non-empty, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `found` is True, `i` is 2**
