According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop will execute. Since the input integer `n` is between 1 and 3 inclusive, and cubes is a list of lists, the cubes list should have at least 1 cube. Before the loop starts, the digits set is empty. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the cubes list must have at least 1 cube, and the cube being processed in the loop is the first cube in the list.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 1 cube, `digits` is an empty set, cube is the first cube in the cubes list**
