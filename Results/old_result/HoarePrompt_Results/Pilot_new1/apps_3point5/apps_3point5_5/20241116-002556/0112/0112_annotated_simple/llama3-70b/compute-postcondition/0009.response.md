According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the cubes list. If the list has at least 4 cubes, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 3 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in all cubes. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list must have at least 4 cubes.
State: **`n` is an input integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, `cubes` is a list of lists containing at least 4 cubes, `digits` is a set containing the string representations of the digits in all cubes**
