According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `cubes` list. If the list has at least 1 cube, the loop will execute. At the start of the loop, `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes, so it doesn't affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, the `cubes` list must have at least 1 cube, and the `cube` variable should be set to the first cube in the list.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, `cube` is the first cube in the list, `digits` is an empty set**
