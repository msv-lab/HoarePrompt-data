Example Answer:
`found` is initialized as `False`. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized as `False`, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is False.
Output State: **`digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with at least 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements initialized as `False`, `digit` is the first character in the `digits` list, `found` is False**
