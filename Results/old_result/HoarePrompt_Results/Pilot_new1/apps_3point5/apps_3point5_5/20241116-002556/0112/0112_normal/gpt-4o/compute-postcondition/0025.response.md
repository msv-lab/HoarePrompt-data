According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `n` and `found`. If `n` is greater than 0 and `found` is False, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `found` is True if the `digit` is found in any cube face, otherwise False, and `digit` progresses through the characters in `digits`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `n` must be greater than 0 and `found` must be False. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements, `found` is False, `digit` progresses through the characters in `digits`**
