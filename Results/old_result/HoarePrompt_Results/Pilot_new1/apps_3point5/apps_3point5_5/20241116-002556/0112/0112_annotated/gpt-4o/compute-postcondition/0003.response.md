Example Answer:
The variable `found` is initialized to `False`. No other variables are affected. Therefore, the Output State is: All elements in the list `used_cubes` are set to `False`, `digits` has at least 1 element, `found` is False.
Output State: **All elements in the list `used_cubes` are set to `False`, `digits` has at least 1 element, `found` is False**
