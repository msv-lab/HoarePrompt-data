According to the code, the loop will execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 1, and the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied. This means that `used_cubes[i]` has been updated to `True` during the last iteration. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values with length `n` where `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, `digits` is non-empty, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `found` is True, `i` is 2, and the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied**
