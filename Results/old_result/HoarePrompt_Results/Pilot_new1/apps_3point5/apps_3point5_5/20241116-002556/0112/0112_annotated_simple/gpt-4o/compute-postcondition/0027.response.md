According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `digits`. If there are more digits to iterate through, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False. For the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted so that there are more digits to iterate through.
State: **found is False, there are more digits in the list to iterate through**
