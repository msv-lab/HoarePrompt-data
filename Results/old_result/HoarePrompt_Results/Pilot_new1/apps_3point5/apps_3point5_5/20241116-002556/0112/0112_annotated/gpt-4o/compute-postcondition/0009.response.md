Postcondition: ***All elements in the list `used_cubes` are either set to `True` if the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied for at least one element, or remain `False` if the condition is not met. The list `digits` still has at least 1 element. The variable `found` is `True` if the condition is satisfied, and `False` otherwise. The variable `n` remains greater than 0, and the variable `i` is still 0. If the condition is met, the loop is terminated prematurely by the `break` statement.***
