Example Answer:
The code snippet creates a list of `n` lists where each inner list contains integers obtained by splitting the input. Since the initial state only mentions `n` as a positive integer representing the number of cubes, the output state will include the creation of the list `cubes` based on the input values.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained by splitting the input**
