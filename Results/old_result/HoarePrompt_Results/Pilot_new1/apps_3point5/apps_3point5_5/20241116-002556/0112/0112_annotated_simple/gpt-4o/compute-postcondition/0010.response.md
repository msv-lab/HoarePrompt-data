According to the code, the loop will execute until the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied, and then it will terminate. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `digits` is non-empty, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `found` is either `True` or `False` depending on the condition, and `i` is 0.

For the loop to execute one more time, the following states need to be adjusted:
1. `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
2. If `found` is `True`, then `used_cubes[i]` should be set to `True`.
3. If `found` is `False`, then no adjustments are needed.

State: **`n` is a positive integer, `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values with length `n`, `digits` is non-empty, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `found` is either `True` if the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied and `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, or `False` if the condition is not satisfied, `i` is 1**
