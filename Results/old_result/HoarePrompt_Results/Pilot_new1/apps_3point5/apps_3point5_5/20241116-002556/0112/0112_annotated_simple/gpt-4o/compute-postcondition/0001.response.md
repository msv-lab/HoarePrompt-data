Example Answer:
Each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers, and `n` is the number of cubes. `used_cubes` is initialized as a list of `False` values with a length of `n`. Therefore, the output state is: n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; used_cubes is a list of `False` values with a length of n.
Output State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; used_cubes is a list of `False` values with a length of n**
