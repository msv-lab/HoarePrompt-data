Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, it appears that the code correctly implements the logic required to determine the maximum number x that Masha can make using her cubes to form all integers from 1 to x. The function `func_1` iterates through numbers until it can no longer form the next number using the available cubes, and the function `can_form_number` checks if a given number can be formed using the available cube faces. The code handles the conditions specified in the problem description, such as not being able to form digit 6 from digit 9 and vice versa. Additionally, the provided examples align with the expected output based on the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
