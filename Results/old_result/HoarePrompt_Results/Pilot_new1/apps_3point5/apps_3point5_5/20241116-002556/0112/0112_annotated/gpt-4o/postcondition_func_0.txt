The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n`, an integer such that 1 <= n <= 3, and `cubes`, a list of n lists where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of a cube (0 <= a_{i}_{j} <= 9). The function iterates until a condition is met and returns the number of iterations x.
