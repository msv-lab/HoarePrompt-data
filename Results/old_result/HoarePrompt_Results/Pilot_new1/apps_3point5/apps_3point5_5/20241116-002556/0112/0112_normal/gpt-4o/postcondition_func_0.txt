The function func_1 accepts an integer n and a list of n lists containing integers. It iterates through the cubes to create a set of unique numbers on each cube face. Then, it finds the smallest number x that cannot be formed with the unique numbers on the faces of the cubes by incrementing x until a number cannot be formed. If n is less than 1, the function returns 0.
