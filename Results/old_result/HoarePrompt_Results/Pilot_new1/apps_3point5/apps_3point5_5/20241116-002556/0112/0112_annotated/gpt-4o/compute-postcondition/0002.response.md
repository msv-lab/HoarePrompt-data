According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `digits`. If the list `digits` has at least 1 element, the loop can execute. Since all elements in the list `used_cubes` are set to `False`, we need to adjust the state so that the loop can execute. Therefore, the state before the loop starts should be modified to: 
State: **All elements in the list `used_cubes` are set to `False`, `digits` has at least 1 element**.
