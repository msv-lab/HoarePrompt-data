Postcondition: ***`digits` is a list of characters obtained from converting `num` to a string with more than 1 character, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True if not already used, `digit` is the next character in the `digits` list, `found` is True after the execution of the if statement. If the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is set to True, and the loop or if statement is exited. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases after the execution of the if else block.***
