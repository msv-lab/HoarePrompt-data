The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`, where `num` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes. Each cube is represented by a list of 6 integers a_{i}_{j} (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9) where i ranges from 1 to n and j ranges from 1 to 6. 

The function has two cases:
Case 1: If there exists an index i such that not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i], then used_cubes will have True values at specific indices, digits will remain non-empty, digit will be the first element in digits, and found will be True. If no such index exists, found will be False, and the loop will not execute. After the execution of the if statement, if found is False, the program returns False.

Case 2: The program returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to determine if a specific condition is met based on the input parameters, and return True or False accordingly.
