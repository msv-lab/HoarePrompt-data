According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `digits`. If `digits` is a non-empty list, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, `n` being a positive integer and `used_cubes` being a list of `False` values with length `n` does not ensure the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `digits` is a non-empty list, and `digit` is the first element in `digits`.
State: **n is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; used_cubes is a list of `False` values with a length of n, digits is a non-empty list, digit is the first element in digits**
