Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `used_cubes` is a list of `False` values with length `n` where all elements are the same as before except `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, `digits` is non-empty, `digit` is the first element in `digits`, `found` is True, `i` is 2. If the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied, then `used_cubes[i]` is set to `True`, `found` is True, and the loop is terminated. All other variables retain their initial values.***
