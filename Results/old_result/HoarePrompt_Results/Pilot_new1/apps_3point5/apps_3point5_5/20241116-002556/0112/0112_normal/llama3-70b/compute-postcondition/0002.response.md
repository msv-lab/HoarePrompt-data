Example Answer: 
The variable `digits` is initialized as an empty set. Since no other variables are involved in this operation, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained by splitting the input; `digits` is an empty set.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer representing the number of cubes; `cubes` is a list of lists containing integers obtained by splitting the input; `digits` is an empty set**
