Example Answer:
`min_lemon` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. The initial values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are provided, so we can calculate the minimum value. 
Output State: **`a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is the input integer provided by the user, `c` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `min_lemon` is the minimum among a, b // 2, and c // 4**
