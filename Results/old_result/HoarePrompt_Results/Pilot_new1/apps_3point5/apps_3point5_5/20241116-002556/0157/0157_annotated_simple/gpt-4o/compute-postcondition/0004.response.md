Example Answer:
`max_lemons` is assigned the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4`. Then, `total_fruits` is calculated by multiplying `max_lemons` with 1, 2, and 4 respectively. The value of `max_lemons` and `total_fruits` depend on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. 
Output State: **`a` is a positive integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum value among `a`, `b // 2`, and `c // 4, `total_fruits` is calculated based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c**.
