According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `num` is within the range `[l, r]`. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum` is updated as `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is the next number after `l`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true. This ensures that the loop will execute one more time. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are: `num` should be incremented to the next number after the current `num`, and `l` should be updated to the current `num`. No other states need adjustment.
State: **After the execution of the if block, `total_sum` is updated as `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `l` is equal to the current `num`, `r` remains the same, `num` is the next number after the current `num`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true**
