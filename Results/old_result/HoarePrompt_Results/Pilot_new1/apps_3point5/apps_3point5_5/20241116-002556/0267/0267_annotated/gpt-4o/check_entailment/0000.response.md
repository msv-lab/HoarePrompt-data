Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code consists of two functions, func_1 and func_2, that work together to calculate the sum of numbers from l to r such that each number contains at most k different digits. 

- Function func_1 correctly determines if a number has at most k different digits by converting the number to a string and checking the length of the set of unique digits.

- Function func_2 iterates through the range of numbers from l to r, calls func_1 for each number, and updates the total_sum with the sum of numbers that satisfy the condition. The final total_sum is returned modulo 998244353.

The code logic aligns with the problem description, and the provided examples also produce the correct output. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
