The function `func_1` accepts three parameters `l`, `r`, and `k`, where `l`, `r`, and `k` are integers satisfying the constraints $1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}$ and $1 \le k \le 10$. The function calculates the difference between the counts of `k` in the range from `l` to `r` (inclusive) using the `count` function with a memoization dictionary `dp`, and returns the result modulo `MOD`. The code does not explicitly define the `count` function, so its implementation and functionality are missing from the provided code.
