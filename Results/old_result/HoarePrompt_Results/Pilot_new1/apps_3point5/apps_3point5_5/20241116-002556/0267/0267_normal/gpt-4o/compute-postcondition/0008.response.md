According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `l` and `r`. If `l` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, and `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + l + 1) % MOD`, `l` is incremented to `l + 1`, and `num` is set to `l + 1`. In all other cases where `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to false, there is no change in the values of `total_sum`, `l`, and `num`. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `l` should be less than or equal to `r` and `num` should be in the range of `l` to `r` based on the conditions specified by `func_1(num, k)`.
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `num` are integers with adjusted values based on the conditions of `func_1(num, k)`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, and `num` is in the range of `l` to `r` based on the conditions specified by `func_1(num, k)**.
