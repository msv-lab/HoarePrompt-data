Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program consists of two functions: `func_1` and `count`. The `func_1` function calculates the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits. It utilizes the `count` function to compute the individual counts for `r` and `l-1`, and then calculates their difference modulo `MOD` to obtain the final result. The `count` function computes the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits within a given range.

The annotations in the code provide a detailed explanation of the logic and calculations performed by each function. The code handles the constraints mentioned in the problem description, such as ensuring that `l` and `r` are within the specified range, and that `k` is a valid number of different digits.

Since the code aligns with the problem description and the annotations do not indicate any potential cases where the program may fail to produce the correct output, we can conclude that the code is correct for all scenarios.
