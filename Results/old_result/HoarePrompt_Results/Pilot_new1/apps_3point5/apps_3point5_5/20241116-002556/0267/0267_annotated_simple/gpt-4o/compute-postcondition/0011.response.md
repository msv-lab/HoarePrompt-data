According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `num`, `l`, and `r`. If `num` is less than or equal to `r`, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, and `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`. `l` is less than `r`, and `num` is the next integer value after the previous iteration. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, `total_sum` is updated as specified. The values of `l`, `r`, and `num` remain unchanged. So for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `num` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num + 1` are integers. If `func_1(num + 1, k)` evaluates to true, `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num + 1) % MOD**.
