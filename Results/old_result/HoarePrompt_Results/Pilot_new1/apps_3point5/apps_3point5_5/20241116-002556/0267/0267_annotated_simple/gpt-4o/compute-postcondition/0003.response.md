Example Answer:
The value of `num` is added to `total_sum` and then taken modulo `MOD`. Since the initial state mentions that `num` equals `l`, the value of `total_sum` will be updated accordingly. 
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated based on the addition of `num` and then taking modulo `MOD`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` equals `l`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true**
