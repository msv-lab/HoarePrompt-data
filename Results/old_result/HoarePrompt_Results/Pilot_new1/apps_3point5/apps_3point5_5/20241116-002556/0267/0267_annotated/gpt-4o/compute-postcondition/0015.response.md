Functionality: **The function func_2 accepts three integers l, r, and k. It iterates through the range of numbers from l to r (inclusive), calls func_1(num, k) for each number, and updates total_sum with the sum of numbers where func_1(num, k) returns true. The final value of total_sum is returned after the loop executes. If l is greater than r, the loop won't execute.**
