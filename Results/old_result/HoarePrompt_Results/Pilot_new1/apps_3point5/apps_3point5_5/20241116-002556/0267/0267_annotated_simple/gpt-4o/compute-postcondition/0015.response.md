Functionality: ** The function `func_2` accepts three parameters: `l`, `r`, and `k`. It iterates through a range of integers from `l` to `r` (inclusive). For each number in this range, it calls `func_1(num, k)`. If the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true, it updates the total_sum by adding the current number `num` and taking the modulus with `MOD`. The function then returns the final value of total_sum. The functionality does not cover cases where `l > r` and the loop does not execute, potentially leading to different outcomes.**
