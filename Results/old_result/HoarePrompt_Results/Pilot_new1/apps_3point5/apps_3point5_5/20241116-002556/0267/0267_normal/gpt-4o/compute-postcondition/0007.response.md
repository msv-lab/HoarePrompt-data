Postcondition: ***total_sum, l, num are integers. If func_1(num, k) evaluates to true, total_sum is updated to (total_sum + l + 1) % MOD, l is incremented to l + 1, and num is set to l + 1. In all other cases where func_1(num, k) evaluates to false, there is no change in the values of total_sum, l, and num.***
