According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range from `l` to `r` inclusive has at least one number. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `r` must be greater than or equal to `l`. Before the loop starts, `total_sum` is 0, so it needs to be adjusted to `l` is less than or equal to `r` and `num` is equal to `l`.
State: **`total_sum` is 0, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`**
