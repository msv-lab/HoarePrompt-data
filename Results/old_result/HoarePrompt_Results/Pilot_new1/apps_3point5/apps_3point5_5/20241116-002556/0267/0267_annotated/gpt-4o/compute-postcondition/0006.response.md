Example Answer:
The `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` and then taking the modulus of `MOD`. The previous values of `total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: `total_sum` is updated as `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is the next number after `l`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true.
Output State: **`total_sum` is updated as `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is the next number after `l`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true**
