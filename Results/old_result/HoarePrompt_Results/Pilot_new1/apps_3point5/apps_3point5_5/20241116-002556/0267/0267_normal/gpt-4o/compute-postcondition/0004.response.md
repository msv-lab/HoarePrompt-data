Postcondition: ***`total_sum`, `l`, `r`, `num` are integers. If `func_1(num, k)` returns true, then `total_sum` is updated to `(total_sum + num) % MOD`, where `num` is equal to `l`. The values of `l` and `r` remain unchanged and `l` is still less than or equal to `r`. Additionally, `func_1` returns true when called with arguments `num` and `k`.***
