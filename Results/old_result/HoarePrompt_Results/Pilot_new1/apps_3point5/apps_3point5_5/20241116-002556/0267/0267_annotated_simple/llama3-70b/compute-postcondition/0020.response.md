Postcondition: ***`n` is a positive integer, `k` is a positive integer such that 1 <= k <= 10, `dp` is a dictionary to store intermediate results. If k is equal to 0, the program returns 0. If the key (n, k) exists in the dictionary dp, then the program returns the value stored at that key. If n is less than 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is updated to n. If n is greater than or equal to 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is updated with a calculated value based on the for loop execution. The loop iterates k-1 times, updating dp[n, k] with specific calculations at each iteration. The final value of dp[n, k] is modulo by MOD at the end of the loop.***
