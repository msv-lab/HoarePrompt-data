Example Answer:
The value of `total_sum` is updated by adding `num` to it and then taking the modulo `MOD`. The initial value of `total_sum` is 0, and `num` is equal to `l`. Therefore, after execution, the new value of `total_sum` will be `(0 + l) % MOD`. Since `l` is less than or equal to `r` and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true, the output state is: total_sum is the updated value, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true.
Output State: **total_sum is the updated value, `l` is less than or equal to `r`, `num` is equal to `l`, and the result of `func_1(num, k)` is true**
