According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `dp[n, k]` is updated with a new calculated value and `i` is increased by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to `i` is less than or equal to `k`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`dp[n, k]` is updated with a new calculated value, `i` is increased by 1, `i` is less than or equal to `k`**
