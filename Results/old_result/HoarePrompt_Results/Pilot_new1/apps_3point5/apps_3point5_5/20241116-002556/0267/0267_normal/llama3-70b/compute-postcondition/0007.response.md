Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, `dp` is a dictionary storing previously calculated values. If `(n, k)` is already a key in the dictionary `dp`, the function returns the value stored at that key. Otherwise, `n` is less than 10, and `dp[n, k]` is assigned the value of `n`.**
