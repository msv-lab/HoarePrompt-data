Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the string `res`. The previous values of `res` and `char` are unknown, so the output state is: `s` is a string with the character replaced once and the replaced character is back in `s`, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the character replaced once and the replaced character is back in `s`, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable**
