Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The length of `res` increases by 1. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string with an additional character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string with an additional character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable**
