Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string input `s` that consists of only small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5 (inclusive). It then compares `s` with the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' character by character. If `s` matches the target string up to the length of the target string, it prints the target string. Otherwise, it prints -1. The function does not explicitly return any value. If the target length is 0 or `s` is an empty string, it behaves differently than described in the annotations, as it prints -1 in these cases.**
