Example Answer:
The character `char` is replaced with the next character in the alphabet using `ord(char) + 1`. The `replace` method replaces the first occurrence of `char` in the string `s`. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains all occurrences of the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char` added to the end.
Output State: **`res` contains all occurrences of the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char` added to the end**
