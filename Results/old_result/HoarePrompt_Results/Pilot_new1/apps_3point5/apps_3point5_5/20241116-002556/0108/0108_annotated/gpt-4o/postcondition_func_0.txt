The function `func` reads a string `s` from the user input and compares it with the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. It iterates over both strings character by character and prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' if all characters in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' are found in `s` in order. If some characters are missing from `s`, it prints -1. If some characters in `s` are not part of 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', it also prints -1. The function does not explicitly return any value.
