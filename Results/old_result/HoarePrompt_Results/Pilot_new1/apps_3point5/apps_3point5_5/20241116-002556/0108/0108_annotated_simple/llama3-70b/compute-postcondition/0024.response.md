Output State: **If `char` is in `s` then `s` will have the first character replaced once and then back to its original value, `res` will have the first character added for each iteration of the loop until `char` is no longer in `s`, `alphabet` remains a valid iterable. If `char` is not in `s` initially, the loop will not execute and there will be no changes to any variables.**
