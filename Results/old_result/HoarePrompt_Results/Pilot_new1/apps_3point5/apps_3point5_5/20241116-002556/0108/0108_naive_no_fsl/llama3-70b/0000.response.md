Correctness: True

Explanation: 
1. The program reads the input string s.
2. It iterates over each character in the English alphabet.
3. For each character, it checks if the character is present in the input string s.
4. If the character is found in the input string, it appends the character to the result string res and replaces the character in the input string with the next character in the alphabet.
5. After iterating over all characters in the alphabet, it checks if the length of the result string is 26 (the length of the English alphabet).
6. If the length is 26, it means that all characters of the alphabet have been found in the input string and replaced accordingly, so it prints the result string.
7. If the length is not 26, it means that it was not possible to obtain the English alphabet as a subsequence, so it prints -1.

The program correctly follows the problem description and handles all potential cases where it is possible to obtain the English alphabet as a subsequence or determine that it is impossible.
