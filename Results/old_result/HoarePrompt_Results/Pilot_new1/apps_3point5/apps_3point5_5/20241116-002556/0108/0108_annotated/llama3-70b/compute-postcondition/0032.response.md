Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of `res`, which contains all occurrences of the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char` added. Therefore, the output state is: `res` contains all occurrences of the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char` added to the end.
Output State: **`res` contains all occurrences of the next character in the alphabet after the last modified `char` added to the end**
