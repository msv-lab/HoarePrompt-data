Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The value of `char` is not specified, but it is assumed to be a lowercase English letter. Therefore, the length of `res` increases by 1, and `res` now contains the added character. The state of `alphabet` remains unchanged.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable**
