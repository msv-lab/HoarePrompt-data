Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`. The value of `char` is not specified in the initial state. Therefore, the output state is: `s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the character `char` added to the end.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters, `res` is a string with the character `char` added to the end**
