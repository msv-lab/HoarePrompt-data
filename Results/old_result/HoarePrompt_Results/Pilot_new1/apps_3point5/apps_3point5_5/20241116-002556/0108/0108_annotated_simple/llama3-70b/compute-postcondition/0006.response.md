According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` being in the string `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with the character replaced once. To ensure the loop executes one more time, the character that was replaced in `s` should be present in `s` again. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string with the character replaced once and the replaced character is back in `s`, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable**
