Postcondition: ***If `j` is equal to `target_len`, the program prints the value of `target`. Otherwise, if `j` is not equal to `target_len`, `i` is incremented to the length of `s`, and `j` is less than 26. If the length of `s` is less than 26, `i` is incremented to the length of `s`, and `j` is less than 26. If `s` is empty, both `i` and `j` remain 0.***
