Example Answer:
The character `char` in string `s` is replaced with the character that comes after it in the alphabet. The replacement is done only once. The length of `s` remains the same. The output state is: `s` is a string with the character replaced once, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the character replaced once, `res` is a string with the added character, `alphabet` is a valid iterable**
