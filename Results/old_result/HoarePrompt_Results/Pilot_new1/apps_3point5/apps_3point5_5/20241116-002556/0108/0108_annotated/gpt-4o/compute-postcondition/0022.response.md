Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `target` is a string. If all characters in `target` were found in `s` in order, the function prints `target`. Otherwise, if some characters in `target` were not found in `s`, the function prints -1. If some characters in `s` were not part of `target`, the function also prints -1.***
