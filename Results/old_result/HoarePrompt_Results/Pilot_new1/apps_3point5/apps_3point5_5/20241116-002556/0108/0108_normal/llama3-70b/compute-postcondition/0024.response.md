Output State: **If `s` contains at least one occurrence of the next character in `alphabet` after the last character checked in the loop, then `s` will be modified with the first occurrence of that character replaced by the next character in `alphabet`, `res` will have additional characters added from that character, and that character will be added to the end of `res`. If `s` does not contain any more characters from the `alphabet` after the last character checked, the loop will end and both `s` and `res` will remain unchanged.**
