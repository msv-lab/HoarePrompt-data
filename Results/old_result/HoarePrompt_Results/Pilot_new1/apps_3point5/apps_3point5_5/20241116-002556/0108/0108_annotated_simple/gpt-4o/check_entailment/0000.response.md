Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input string `s` and compares it with the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' character by character. It then prints the target string if `s` contains the characters in the target string in order, otherwise, it prints -1. The logic of the program matches the problem description and all possible cases have been considered.
