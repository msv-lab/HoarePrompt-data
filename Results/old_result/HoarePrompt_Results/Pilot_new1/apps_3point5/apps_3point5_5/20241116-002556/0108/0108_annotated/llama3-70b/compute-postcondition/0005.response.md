Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the alphabet. The value of `char` is not specified in the initial state, so the output state will depend on the specific value of `char`. 
Output State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the alphabet; `alphabet` is a string containing all lowercase English letters; `res` is a string with the character `char` added to the end**
