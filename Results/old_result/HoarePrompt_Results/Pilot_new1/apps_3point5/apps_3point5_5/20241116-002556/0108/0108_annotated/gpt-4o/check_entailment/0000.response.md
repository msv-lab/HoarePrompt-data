Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads a string `s` and compares it with the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. It iterates over both strings character by character and checks if all characters in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' are found in `s` in order. If some characters are missing from `s`, it prints -1. If some characters in `s` are not part of 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', it also prints -1. The code correctly follows the problem description for every potential case as it ensures that the target string is a subsequence of the input string `s`. The annotations provide a clear explanation of the program's logic and how it handles the different scenarios, which align with the problem requirements.
