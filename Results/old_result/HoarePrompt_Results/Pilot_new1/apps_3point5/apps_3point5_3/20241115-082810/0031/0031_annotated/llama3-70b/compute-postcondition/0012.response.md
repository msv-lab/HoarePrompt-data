According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `k`. If `i` is less than `k`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 0. Since `k` is greater than 0, it does not ensure that the loop will execute again. Therefore, `k` needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`total_days` is 2 to the power of `n`, `numerator` is multiplied by `(total_days - i)`, `denominator` is multiplied by 2 to the power of `n`, `i` is 2, `k` is greater than 1, `denominator` is multiplied by `total_days` squared, `numerator` is further multiplied by `total_days - i**
