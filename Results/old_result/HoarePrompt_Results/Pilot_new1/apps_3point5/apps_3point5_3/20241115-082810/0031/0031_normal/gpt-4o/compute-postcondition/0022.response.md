Example Answer:
The value of `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`. The value of `p_shared` is calculated using the updated values, so `A` will have the same value as `p_shared`. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_no_shared` has the updated value based on the condition, `p_total` retains its value, and `p_shared` is calculated using the updated values, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` has the updated value based on the condition, `p_total` retains its value, and `p_shared` is calculated using the updated values, `A` is assigned the value of `p_shared`**
