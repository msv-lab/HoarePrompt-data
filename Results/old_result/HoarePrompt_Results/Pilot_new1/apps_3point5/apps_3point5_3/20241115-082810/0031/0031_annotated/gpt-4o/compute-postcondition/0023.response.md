Example Answer:
The value of `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`, and `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`. The states of other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, `A` is assigned the calculated value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, `A` is assigned the calculated value of `p_shared`, and `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`**
