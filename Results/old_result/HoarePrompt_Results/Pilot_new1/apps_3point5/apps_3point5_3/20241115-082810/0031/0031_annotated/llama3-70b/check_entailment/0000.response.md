Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
After reviewing the code and the problem description, it can be observed that the code correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in a year with 2^n days. The code follows the problem description by calculating the numerator and denominator values based on the given inputs of n and k. It then reduces the fraction to its irreducible form and returns the remainders of the division by (10^6 + 3) as required.

The annotations provide a clear explanation of what the code does and how it operates after each step. They highlight the purpose of the loop and the final calculation of the remainders. By cross-referencing the code with the problem description and the provided examples, it can be concluded that the code functions correctly for all potential cases.
