Example Answer:
If k is greater than 0, p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator. If k is 0 or negative, p_no_shared remains 1. After that, p_total is assigned the value of denominator. 
Output State: **If k is greater than 0, p_no_shared is assigned the value of numerator. If k is 0 or negative, p_no_shared remains 1. p_total is assigned the value of denominator.**
