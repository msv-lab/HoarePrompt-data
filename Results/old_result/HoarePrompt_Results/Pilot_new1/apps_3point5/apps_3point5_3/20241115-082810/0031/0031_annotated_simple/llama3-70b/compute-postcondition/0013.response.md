Output State: **numerator is the result of the product of (total_days - 1), (total_days - 2), ..., (total_days - k), denominator is the result of the product of total_days raised to the power of k, total_days is 2 raised to the power of n, i is k (last iteration), k is greater than or equal to 0. If k is 0, the loop does not execute and numerator and denominator remain 1**
