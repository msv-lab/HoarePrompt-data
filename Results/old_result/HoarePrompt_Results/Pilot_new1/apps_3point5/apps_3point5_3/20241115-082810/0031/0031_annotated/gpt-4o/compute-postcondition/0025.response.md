Example Answer:
The value of `A` is updated by performing integer division with `g`. The previous values of `A` and `g` are unknown, so the final value of `A` cannot be determined. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, `A` is updated by performing integer division with `g`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`.
Output State: **`p_no_shared` is assigned the value of `numerator`, `p_total` is assigned the value of `denominator`, `p_shared` is calculated based on the given formula, `A` is updated by performing integer division with `g`, `B` is assigned the value of `p_total`**
