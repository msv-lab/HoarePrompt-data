The function `func_2` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`. The constraints for the parameters are that `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. 

The function assigns the value 1000003 to the variable MOD. If k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, the program prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, the program returns nothing. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept two integers `n` and `k` within the specified constraints, and if k is greater than 1 shifted left by n, it prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, it returns nothing.
