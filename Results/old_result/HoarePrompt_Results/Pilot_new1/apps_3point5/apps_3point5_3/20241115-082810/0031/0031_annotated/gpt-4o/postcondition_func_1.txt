The function `func_2` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`. It assigns the value 1000003 to `MOD`. If `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n`, the program prints 1 and 1. If this condition is not met, it calculates `numerator` and `denominator` based on the values of `total_days` and `k`. Then, it computes `p_no_shared`, `p_total`, and `p_shared` using the calculated values. After that, it calls a function `func_1` with `A` and `B` as arguments, updates `A` and `B` based on the returned value, and finally prints the modulo of `A` and `B` with `MOD`.
