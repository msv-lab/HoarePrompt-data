Example Answer:
`total_days` is assigned the value of 1 shifted left by `n`. Since the value of `n` is not given, we cannot determine the exact value of `total_days`. If `k` is greater than 1 shifted left by `n`, the program prints 1 and 1. Otherwise, the program returns nothing. Therefore, the Output State is: MOD is assigned the value 1000003.
Output State: **MOD is assigned the value 1000003**
