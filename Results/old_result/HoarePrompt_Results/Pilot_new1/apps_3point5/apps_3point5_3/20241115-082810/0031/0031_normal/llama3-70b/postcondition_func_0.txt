The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, where 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 2 ≤ k ≤ 10^18. It calculates the value of `numerator` and `denominator` based on the input values of `n` and `k`. Then, it computes the greatest common divisor (gcd) of `numerator` and `denominator`, updates both values by dividing them by the gcd, and finally returns the remainders of `numerator` and `denominator` divided by (10^6 + 3). The function does not handle cases where k is 0 or negative, potentially leading to unexpected behavior.
