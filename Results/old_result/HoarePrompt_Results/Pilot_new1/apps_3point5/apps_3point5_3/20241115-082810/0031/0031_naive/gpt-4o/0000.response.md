Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly calculates the probability of at least two people having the same birthday in Udayland as described in the problem statement.
2. It handles the case where k is greater than 2^n by printing 1 1.
3. The program uses modular arithmetic to handle large numbers and then reduces the fraction to its irreducible form.
4. The implementation of the functions func_1 and func_2 are correct and align with the problem description.
5. The program correctly calculates the values of A and B modulo 10^6 + 3 and prints them.
