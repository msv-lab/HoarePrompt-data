Example Answer:
The values of x and y are assigned by mapping the input to integers. The input is split, and the first integer goes to x and the second integer goes to y. The values of x and y are now determined by the input provided. Therefore, the Output State is: x and y are assigned the input integers.
Output State: **x and y are assigned the input integers**
