Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes two integers x and y as input, representing the starting and ending equilateral triangle side lengths respectively. It then calculates the minimum number of seconds required for Memory to obtain the equilateral triangle of side length y from x using the formula ((x - y) // 2 + (x - y) % 2). 

The code correctly handles the case where x and y are integers such that 3 ≤ y < x ≤ 100,000. It follows the problem description for all potential cases as described in the examples provided. The output hints also align with the code functionality, confirming that the code is correct.
