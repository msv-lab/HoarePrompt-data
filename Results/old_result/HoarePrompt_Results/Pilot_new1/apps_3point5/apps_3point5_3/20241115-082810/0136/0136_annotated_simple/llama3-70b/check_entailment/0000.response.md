Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes two non-negative integers as input and compares them after removing any leading zeros. It correctly determines whether a is less than, equal to, or greater than b based on the problem description. The logic provided in the code is sufficient to handle all potential cases, and the examples provided in the problem description also work correctly with the code.
