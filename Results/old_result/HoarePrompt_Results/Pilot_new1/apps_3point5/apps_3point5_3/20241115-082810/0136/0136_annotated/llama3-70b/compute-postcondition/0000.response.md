Example Answer:
The code removes any leading zeros from the input string `a` using the `lstrip` method. The value of `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros**
