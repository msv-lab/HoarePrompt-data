Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If `a` is less than `b`, the program prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is equal to `b`, the program prints '='. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, and the value of `a` is correctly compared to `b` in all scenarios, including edge cases such as when `a` is an empty string or when `b` is an empty string. The program handles the comparison between `a` and `b` accurately and outputs the correct symbol.***
