Example Answer:
The code snippet removes leading zeros from the string `a` stored in `data[0]`. This ensures that the string representation of the non-negative integer `a` does not have any leading zeros. The other variables are not affected.
Output State: **`a` is a non-negative integer represented as a string without leading zeros, `b` is a non-negative integer represented as a string**
