Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If `a` is greater than `b`, the program prints '>'. If `a` is less than or equal to `b`, the program prints '='. The length of `a` is greater than or equal to the length of `b`, and the value of `a` is greater than or equal to `b`. In all cases, the program correctly handles the comparison between `a` and `b` and prints the appropriate symbol.***
