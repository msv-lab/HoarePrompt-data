Correctness: True

Explanation: The program takes two non-negative integers as input, removes any leading zeros, and compares them to determine which one is greater or if they are equal. The program correctly handles cases where the input integers have leading zeros, and it compares the integers based on their lengths and values. The program provides the correct output ("<", ">", or "=") based on the comparison of the two integers. The logic and conditions in the program align with the problem description, and it covers all potential cases.
