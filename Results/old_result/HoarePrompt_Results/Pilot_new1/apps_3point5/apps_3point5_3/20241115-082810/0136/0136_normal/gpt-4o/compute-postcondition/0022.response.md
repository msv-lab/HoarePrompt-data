Postcondition: ***`a` and `b` are non-negative integers represented as strings. If the value of `a` is greater than `b`, then the program prints '>'. If the value of `a` is equal to `b`, then the program prints '='. The length of `a` is equal to or less than the length of `b`, and the value of `a` is greater than or equal to `b`.***
