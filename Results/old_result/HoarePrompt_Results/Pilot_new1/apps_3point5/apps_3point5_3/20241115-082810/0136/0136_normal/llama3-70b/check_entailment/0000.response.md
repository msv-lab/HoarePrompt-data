Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two non-negative integers `a` and `b` as strings with no leading zeros. It then compares the integer values represented by `a` and `b`. If `a` is equal to `b`, it prints '='. If `a` is less than `b`, it prints '<'. If `a` is greater than `b`, it prints '>'. The code seems to follow the problem description for all potential cases, as it correctly handles the comparison of two very large integers without leading zeros. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that it is correctly implemented.
