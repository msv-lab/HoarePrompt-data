Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `shares` are positive integers such that 1 <= n, m <= 30 and 1 <= r <= 1000, `s` is a list of integers obtained by splitting the input and sorted in ascending order with at least 1 element, `b` is a list of integers obtained by mapping the input split to integers and sorted in descending order with at least 1 element, `i` is 0. If r is greater than or equal to the element at index `i` in the list `s`, `shares` is incremented by the integer division of r by the element at index `i` in the list `s` and r is updated to the remainder of the division. If r is less than s[i], the loop breaks.***
