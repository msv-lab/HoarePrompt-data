Example Answer:
`max_shares` is assigned the value of `r` divided by `min_buy_price`. Since `r`, `min_buy_price` are positive integers within the specified ranges, the division will result in an integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers created by mapping input values to integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, and `max_sell_price` is larger than `min_buy_price`, and `max_shares` is an integer calculated by dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, `r` are positive integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a list of integers, `b` is a list of integers created by mapping input values to integers, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value in list `s`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value in list `b`, `max_sell_price` is larger than `min_buy_price`, and `max_shares` is an integer calculated by dividing `r` by `min_buy_price`**
