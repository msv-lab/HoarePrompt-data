Example Answer:
The code snippet `print(r)` will output the value of `r`. However, the variables `b`, `min_buy_price`, and `max_sell_price` are not affected by this code snippet. Therefore, the output state remains the same.
Output State: **`b` contains the integers obtained by splitting the input string, `min_buy_price` is the minimum value of `b`, `max_sell_price` is the maximum value of `b`, and the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price**
