Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `r` is updated according to the formula r += shares * b[i], `i` is 1, `shares` is 0. If shares is greater than 0, r is increased by the product of shares and b[i], and shares is reset to 0. If shares is not greater than 0, and r is greater than or equal to s[i+1], then the program breaks out of the if-else block.***
