Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `i` is 0. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is reset to 0. If `shares` is less than or equal to 0, the program breaks out of the loop or if statement.***
