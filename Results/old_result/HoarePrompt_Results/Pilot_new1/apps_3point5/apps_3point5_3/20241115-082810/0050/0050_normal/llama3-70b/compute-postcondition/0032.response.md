According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If `i` is less than `m`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are integers, `shares` is 0. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `m`.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are integers, `shares` is 0**
