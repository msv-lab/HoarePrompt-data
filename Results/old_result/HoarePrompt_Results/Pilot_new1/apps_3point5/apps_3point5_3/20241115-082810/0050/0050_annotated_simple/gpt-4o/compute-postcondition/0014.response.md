Functionality: **The function `func` reads input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, then creates lists `s` and `b` from subsequent inputs. It calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`. If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the value of `r`. Otherwise, if the maximum sell price is greater than the minimum buy price, it calculates the maximum shares that can be bought, remaining currency after buying those shares, and the total currency after selling those shares. The function does not explicitly return any value.**
