Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads the input values for `n`, `m`, and `r`, as well as the lists of integers for `s` and `b`.
- It calculates the minimum buy price from list `s` and the maximum sell price from list `b`.
- If the maximum sell price is less than or equal to the minimum buy price, it prints the initial investment `r`.
- Otherwise, it correctly calculates the maximum number of shares that can be bought with `r`, the remaining amount of money after buying those shares, and the total amount of money after selling those shares.
- The total amount of money is then printed as the output.
- The code covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
