Postcondition: ***n is greater than 0, m and r are input integers within the specified ranges, s is a sorted list of integers created from the input, b is a list of integers created from the input sorted in descending order, shares is an integer. If r is greater than or equal to s[i], shares is increased by the integer division of r by s[i] and r is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i]. If r is less than s[i], the program breaks out of the loop.***
