According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `m`. If m is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, if n is greater than 0 and r is greater than or equal to s[i], the loop will execute at least once. Thus, the initial state should be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to s[i], and `i` is 0.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to s[i], `i` is 0**
