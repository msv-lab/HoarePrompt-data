Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. The previous value of `r` is unknown, but `shares` is greater than 0. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are integers, `shares` is greater than 0, and `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are integers, `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`**
