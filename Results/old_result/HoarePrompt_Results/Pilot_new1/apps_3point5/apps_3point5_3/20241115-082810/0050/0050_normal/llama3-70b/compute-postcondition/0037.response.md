According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `m`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are integers, `shares` is 0. If shares is greater than 0, `r` is updated to the sum of its current value and the product of shares and b[i], and shares is reset to 0. Otherwise, if shares is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the most internal loop or if statement. 
For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are integers, `shares` is 0, `i` is incremented by 1**
