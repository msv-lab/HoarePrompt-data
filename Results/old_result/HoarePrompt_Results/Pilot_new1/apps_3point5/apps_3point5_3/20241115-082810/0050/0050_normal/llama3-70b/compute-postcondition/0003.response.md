Example Answer:
The list `s` is sorted in ascending order. The values of the other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a sorted list of integers created from the input, and `b` is a list of integers created from the input.
Output State: **`n`, `m`, and `r` are input integers within the specified ranges, `s` is a sorted list of integers created from the input, and `b` is a list of integers created from the input**
