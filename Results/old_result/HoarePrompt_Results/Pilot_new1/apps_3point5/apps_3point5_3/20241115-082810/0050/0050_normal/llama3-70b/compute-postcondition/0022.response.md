Postcondition: ***n, m, r, shares are integers. If r is greater than or equal to the (i+1)-th element of the sorted list s, shares is increased by the integer division of r by s[i+1] and r is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i+1]. If r is less than the (i+1)-th element of the sorted list s, the program breaks out of the loop. In the if part, shares is increased by the integer division of r by s[i] and r is updated to the remainder of r divided by s[i]. In the else part, the program breaks out of the loop.***
