Example Answer:
The value of `r` is incremented by the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. The previous value of `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, so after execution, the new value of `r` is also greater than or equal to `s[i]`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `i` is 0, `shares` is greater than 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `r` is greater than or equal to `s[i]`, `i` is 0, `shares` is greater than 0**
