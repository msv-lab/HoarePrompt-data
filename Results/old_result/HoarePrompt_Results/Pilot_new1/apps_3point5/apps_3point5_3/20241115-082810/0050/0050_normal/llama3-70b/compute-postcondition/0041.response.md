Postcondition: ***`n`, `m`, `r`, `shares`, and `i` are integers. If `shares` is greater than 0, `r` is updated to the previous value of `r` plus the product of `shares` and `b[i]`, and `shares` is set to 0. If `shares` is not greater than 0, the program breaks out of the innermost loop or if statement. In both cases, `i` is incremented by 1.***
