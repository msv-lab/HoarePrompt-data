Example Answer:
The value of `r` is updated by adding the product of `shares` and `b[i]`. Since the initial value of `shares` is 0, the value of `r` remains unchanged. The other variables `n` and `m` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are integers, `shares` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `m` and `r` are integers, `shares` is 0**
