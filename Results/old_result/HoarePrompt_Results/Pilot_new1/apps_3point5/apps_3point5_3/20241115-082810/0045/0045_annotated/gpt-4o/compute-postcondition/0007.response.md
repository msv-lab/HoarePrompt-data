According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is at least 1. Before the loop starts, `min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k` does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is the calculated value of `n - d * min_sum`, and `sequence` contains the elements `(d * (i + 1))` for each `i` in the range `k`.
