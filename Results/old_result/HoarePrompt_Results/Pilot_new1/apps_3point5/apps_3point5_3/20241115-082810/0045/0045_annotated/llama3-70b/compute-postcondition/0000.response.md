Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b`, and `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `a` and `b` are positive integers, the new values of `a` and `b` are updated accordingly. 
Output State: **a and b are positive integers, updated based on the calculations after the operation**
