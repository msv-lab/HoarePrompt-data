Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program first calculates the greatest common divisor of two numbers using the Euclidean algorithm in the `func_1` function.
2. It then takes input for n and k, representing the total sum and the number of elements in the sequence respectively.
3. If n is less than k, it immediately prints -1 as there is no possible sequence.
4. Otherwise, it iterates from 1 to k, adding each number to the sequence and subtracting it from n. If n becomes less than the current number, it breaks out of the loop.
5. Finally, if the length of the sequence is not equal to k, it prints -1. Otherwise, it prints the sequence.
6. The program correctly outputs the sequence where the sum is equal to n and the greatest common divisor is maximal.
