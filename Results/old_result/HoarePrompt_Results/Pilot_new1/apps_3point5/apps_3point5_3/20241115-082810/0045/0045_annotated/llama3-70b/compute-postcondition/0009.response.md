Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts two positive integers a and b. It calculates the greatest common divisor (GCD) of a and b using the Euclidean algorithm. The function returns the value of a, which is also a positive integer. If either a or b is 0, the function will return the non-zero positive integer as the GCD. **
