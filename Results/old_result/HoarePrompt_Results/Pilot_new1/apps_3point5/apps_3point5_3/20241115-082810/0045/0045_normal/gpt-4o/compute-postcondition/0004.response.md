Example Answer: 
The value of `n` is divided by `min_sum`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the program returns -1. Otherwise, the value of `d` is calculated based on the division. The state of other variables remains unchanged.
Output State: **`min_sum` is the calculated value of k * (k + 1) // 2 based on the given constraints. If `min_sum` is greater than n, the program returns -1. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.**
