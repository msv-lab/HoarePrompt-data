According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `b` is truthy (not equal to 0). At the end of the previous iteration, `a` and `b` are positive integers and `b` is not equal to 0. To ensure that the loop can execute one more time, the value of `b` needs to be adjusted to a non-zero positive integer. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, updated based on the calculations after the operation, and `b` is a non-zero positive integer**
