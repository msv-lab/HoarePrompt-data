According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is within the range from `k-1` to -1 (inclusive). At the end of the last iteration, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k-3`, so `i` is within the valid range for the loop to execute again. Therefore, no adjustments need to be made to `k` or `i`. 

However, since `sequence[i]` was incremented by 1 in the previous iteration, for the loop to execute one more time, `sequence[i]` should be adjusted back to its original value before the increment. 

State: **`min_sum` is greater than `n`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is -3, `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range from 0 to `k-1`, `k` is greater than 0, `i` is `k-3`, `sequence[i]` is not incremented by 1.**
