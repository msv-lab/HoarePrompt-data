Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code takes two positive integers `n` and `k` as input.
- It calculates the minimum sum `min_sum` required to create a sequence of `k` positive numbers.
- If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, it returns -1 as there is no possible sequence.
- Otherwise, it calculates the common divisor `d` by dividing `n` by `min_sum`.
- It then generates a list `sequence` containing elements based on the formula `d * (i + 1)` for each `i` in the range of `k`.
- The code adjusts the elements in `sequence` based on the remainder of `n` divided by `min_sum`.
- Finally, it returns the updated list `sequence` as the output.

The code seems to correctly follow the problem description and provides a solution to find a strictly increasing sequence of `k` positive numbers with the maximum greatest common divisor, whose sum is equal to `n`. The output hints also align with the code logic, confirming its correctness.
