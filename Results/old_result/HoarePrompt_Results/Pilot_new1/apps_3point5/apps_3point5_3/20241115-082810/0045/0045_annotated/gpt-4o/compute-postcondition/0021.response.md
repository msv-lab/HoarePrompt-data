Output State: **`min_sum` is the sum of integers from 1 to `k`, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, `remainder` is -2, `sequence` contains the elements `(d * (i + 1) + 1)` for each `i` in the range `k`, `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is `k - 2`. If `remainder` is 0, the program breaks out of the loop. Otherwise, `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1.**
