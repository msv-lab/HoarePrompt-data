According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is within the range of `k - 1` to 0. At the end of the last iteration, `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `(d * (i + 1))` for each `i` in the range of `k`, where `k` is at least 1, `sequence` is not empty, `i` is equal to `k - 2`, and `remainder` is equal to 0. The loop or if statement is broken out of, and `sequence[i]` is incremented by 1. 

To execute the loop one more time, the state needs to be adjusted as follows:
State: **If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. `sequence` is a list containing elements calculated as `(d * (i + 1))` for each `i` in the range of `k`, where `k` is at least 1, `sequence` is not empty, `i` is equal to `k - 3`, and `remainder` is equal to 0.**
