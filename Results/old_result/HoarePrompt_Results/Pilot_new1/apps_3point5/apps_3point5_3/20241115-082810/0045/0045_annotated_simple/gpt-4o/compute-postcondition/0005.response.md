Example Answer:
If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `d` is assigned the value of `n` divided by `min_sum`. Then, `remainder` is calculated as `n - d * min_sum`.
Output State: **If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, `d` is the result of `n` divided by `min_sum`, and `remainder` is the result of `n - d * min_sum`**
