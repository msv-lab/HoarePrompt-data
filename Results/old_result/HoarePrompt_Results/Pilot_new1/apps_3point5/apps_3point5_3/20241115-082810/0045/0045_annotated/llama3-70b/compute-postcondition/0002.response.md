Example Answer:
The values of `a` and `b` are swapped, and `a` is assigned the value of `b`, while `b` is assigned the value of `a % b`. Since `b` is not equal to 0, the value of `a % b` will be a positive integer. Therefore, the new values of `a` and `b` are updated based on these calculations.
Output State: **`a` and `b` are positive integers, updated based on the calculations after the operation, and `b` is not equal to 0**
