Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two positive integers `n` and `k`. It calculates the minimum sum of integers from 1 to `k` as `min_sum`. If `min_sum` is greater than `n`, the function returns -1. Otherwise, it creates a sequence list by dividing `n` by `min_sum`, calculating the remainder, and adjusting the sequence elements accordingly. The function then returns the updated sequence list. The code does not handle cases where `n` or `k` are not positive integers, and it does not account for the scenario where `k` is 0 which could lead to division by zero error.**
