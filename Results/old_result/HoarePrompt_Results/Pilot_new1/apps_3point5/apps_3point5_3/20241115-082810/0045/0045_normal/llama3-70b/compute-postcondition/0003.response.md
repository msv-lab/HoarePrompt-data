According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the value of `b` is truthy (non-zero). At the end of the last iteration, `a` is 0 and `b` is 1. To ensure the loop executes one more time, you need to adjust the state of `b` to be non-zero. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`a` is 0, `b` is non-zero**
