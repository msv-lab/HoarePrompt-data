According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `k` is a positive integer. Since `k` is used in the loop range, it must be at least 1 for the loop to execute. Before the loop starts, `seen` is an empty set does not impact the loop execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted to `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` is an empty set, and `i` is 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` is an empty set, `i` is 1**
