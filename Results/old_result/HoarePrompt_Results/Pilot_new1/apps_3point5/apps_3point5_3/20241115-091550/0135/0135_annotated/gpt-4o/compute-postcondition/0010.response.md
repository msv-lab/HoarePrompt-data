Example Answer: 
The remainder of the division of `n` by `i` is calculated and stored in the variable `remainder`. The previous values of `n` and `i` are unknown, so the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainder of n % i, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of n % i.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainder of n % i, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the remainder of n % i**
