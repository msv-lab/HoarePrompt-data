According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 3. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainder of n % i, `i` is 3, `remainder` is the remainder of n % i**
