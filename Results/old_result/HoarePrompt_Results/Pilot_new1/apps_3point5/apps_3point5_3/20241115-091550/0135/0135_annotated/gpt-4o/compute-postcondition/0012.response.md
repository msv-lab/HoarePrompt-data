Example Answer:
The code calculates the remainder of n divided by i, where i is 3. The previous values of n and i are known, and the remainder is calculated accordingly. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, seen_remainders is a set containing the remainder of n % i, i is 3, remainder is the remainder of n % i.
Output State: **n and k are integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18 and 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, seen_remainders is a set containing the remainder of n % i, i is 3, remainder is the remainder of n % i**
