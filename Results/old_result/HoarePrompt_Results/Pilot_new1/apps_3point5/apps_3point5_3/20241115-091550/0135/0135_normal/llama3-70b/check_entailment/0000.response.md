Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads two integers `n` and `k` from the input, then iterates from 1 to `k`. For each iteration, it calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`. If any remainder is already in the set `seen`, it prints 'No' and exits the program. Otherwise, it adds the remainder to the set `seen`. After the loop, if no duplicate remainders were found, it prints 'Yes'. The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases as it checks for distinct remainders for all integers from 1 to k. The output hints also confirm that the code is correctly implemented.
