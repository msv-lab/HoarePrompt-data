Example Answer:
The remainder is calculated by taking the modulus of `n` and `i`, where `n` and `i` are integers. The value of `n` is between 1 and 10^18, and the initial value of `i` is 1. Therefore, the remainder can be any value between 0 and 1. Since `remainder` is the only affected variable, the output state is: `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is a value between 0 and 1.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is an empty set, `i` is 1, `remainder` is a value between 0 and 1**
