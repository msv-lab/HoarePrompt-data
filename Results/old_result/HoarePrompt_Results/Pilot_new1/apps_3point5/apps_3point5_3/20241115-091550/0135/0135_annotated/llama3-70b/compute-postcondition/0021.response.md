According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` contains `remainder`, `i` is 3, `remainder` is updated to the result of `n % i` and `remainder` is added to `seen`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 4.
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` contains `remainder`, `i` is 4, `remainder` is updated to the result of `n % i` and `remainder` is added to `seen**.
