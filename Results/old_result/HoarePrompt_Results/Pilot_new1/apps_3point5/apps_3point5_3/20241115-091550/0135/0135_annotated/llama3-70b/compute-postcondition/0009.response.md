According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` contains `remainder`, `i` is 1, and `remainder` is 0. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`n` is a positive integer, `k` is at least 1, `seen` contains `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is updated based on the loop body**
