Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly checks if all the remainders of dividing `n` by integers from 1 to `k` are distinct. It first handles the case where `k` is greater than or equal to `n` by returning 'No'. Then, it iterates through all integers from 1 to `k`, calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, and checks if this remainder has been seen before. If a remainder is found to be repeated, the program returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes' indicating that all remainders are distinct. The program follows the problem description for all potential cases and the provided examples, making it correct.
