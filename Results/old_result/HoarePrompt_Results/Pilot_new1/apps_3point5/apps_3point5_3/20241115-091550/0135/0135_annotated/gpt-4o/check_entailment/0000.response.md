Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It checks if all the remainders of division of n by integers from 1 to k are distinct. It uses a set to keep track of the seen remainders and returns "Yes" if all remainders are distinct, and "No" otherwise. The annotations provide a clear explanation of what the code is doing and how it handles different cases. Additionally, the examples provided in the problem description align with the logic of the code, confirming its correctness.
