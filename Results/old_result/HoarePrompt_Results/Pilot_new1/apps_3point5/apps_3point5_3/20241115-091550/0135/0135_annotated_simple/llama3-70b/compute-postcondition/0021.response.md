According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `k+1`, so `i` needs to be adjusted to `k+2` for the loop to execute one more time. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` and `k` are input integers where `k` is greater than or equal to 1, `seen` is a set containing the remainder values of `n` modulo `i` for all `i` from 1 to `k+1`, `remainder` is the result of `n` modulo `k` and is in `seen`, `remainder` has been added to `seen`, `i` is `k+2`**
