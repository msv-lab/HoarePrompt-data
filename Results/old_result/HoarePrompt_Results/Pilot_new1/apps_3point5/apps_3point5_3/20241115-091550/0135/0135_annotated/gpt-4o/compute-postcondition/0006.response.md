Postcondition: ***`n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^18, `k` is an integer such that 1 ≤ k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainder obtained from n % i where i ranges from 1 to the point where the condition (remainder in seen_remainders) becomes true, `i` is an integer greater than 1, remainder is the result of n % i***
