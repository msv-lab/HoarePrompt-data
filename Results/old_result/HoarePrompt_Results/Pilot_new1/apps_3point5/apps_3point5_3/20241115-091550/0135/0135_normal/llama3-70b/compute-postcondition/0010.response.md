Example Answer:
The code calculates the remainder of `n` divided by `i`, where `i` is 2. Since `i` is fixed at 2, the remainder will always be either 0 or 1. The set `seen` contains the value of `remainder`, so the set `seen` will either contain 0 or 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1.
Output State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing 0 or 1, `i` is 2, `remainder` is either 0 or 1**
