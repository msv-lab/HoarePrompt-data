According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `k`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 1, `remainder` is the result of n % i. If the value of `remainder` is already in the set `seen`, then the program prints 'No' and exits.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to continue the loop, so `i` should be updated to 2.
- No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen` is a set containing the value of `remainder`, `i` is 2, `remainder` is the result of n % i**
