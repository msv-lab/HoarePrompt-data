The function `func_1` accepts two integer parameters `n` and `k`, both ranging from 1 to 10^18. 

- If k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns 'No'.
- If k is less than n, the loop iterates k times, checking for duplicate remainders. If a duplicate is found, it returns 'No'. Otherwise, it returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function is to determine whether there are any duplicate remainders when dividing n by numbers from 1 to k, returning 'Yes' if there are none and 'No' if there are duplicates.
