The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `n` and `k`, both of which are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. 

In Case 1, if k is greater than or equal to n, the function returns the string 'No'.

In Case 2, if k is less than n, the loop will execute k times. After the loop executes, `n` and `k` are integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18, `seen_remainders` is a set containing the remainders seen so far, `i` is the number of iterations, and `remainder` is a value between 0 and k. If any `remainder` is in `seen_remainders`, the function returns 'No'. Otherwise, the state of the variables remains unchanged after the execution of the loop.

In Case 3, the program returns 'Yes'.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `n` and `k`, and based on the conditions described in the cases, return either 'No' or 'Yes'.
