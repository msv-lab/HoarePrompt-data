The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function calculates and returns the result of the expression (n^k + k^n) % (n - k). The precondition for this function is that `n` and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, k ≤ 10^18. Therefore, the functionality of the function func is to calculate the result of the expression (n^k + k^n) % (n - k) given the constraints on `n` and `k`.
