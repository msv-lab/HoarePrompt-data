According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the list `results`. If the list has at least 3 results, the loop executes again. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of 1, `results` is a list of results with at least 2 results, `result` is the second result in the list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the list `results` must have at least 3 results, and `result` should be the third result in the list.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of 1, `results` is a list of results with at least 3 results, `result` is the third result in the list**
