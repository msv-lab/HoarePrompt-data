Output State: **`T` is a positive integer greater than 0, `index` is 3, `results` is an empty list, `x` is assigned the integer value of `data[1]`, `balance` is the result of the subtraction, `prefix_balances` is a list of zeros with a length of `n+1`, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 3, `prefix_balances[3]` is updated based on the formula `prefix_balances[i] = prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
