Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly calculate the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$. The issue lies in the logic used to determine the count of such prefixes. The program uses a brute force approach to iterate through all possible prefixes and calculate the balance at each step. This approach may not be efficient for all test cases and can lead to incorrect results.

To illustrate the incorrectness of the program, consider the following test case:

Input:
1
4 0
1010

Expected Output:
3

Explanation:
For the input string "1010", the prefixes with balance equal to 0 are "1", "10", and "1010". The expected count of such prefixes is 3. However, the given program may not provide the correct output for this test case due to its inefficient implementation.

Therefore, the correctness of the program is **False**.
