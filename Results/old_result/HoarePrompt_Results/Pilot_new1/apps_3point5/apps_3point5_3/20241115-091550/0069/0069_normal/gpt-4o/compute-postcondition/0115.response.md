Postcondition: ***If n is greater than 0, the loop executes n times updating prefix_balances with the cumulative sum. If n is 0 or lower, prefix_balances remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. If balance is 0, prefix_balances will be a list of zeros with a length of 1. If x is in prefix_balances, -1 is appended to results. If x is not in prefix_balances, 0 is appended to results. In all cases, the length of the results list increases by 1 after the execution of the if-else block. count is an integer, and results contains the appended count value.***
