According to the code, the loop will only execute if `n` is greater than or equal to 1 and the balance is not equal to 0. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute, the following modifications need to be made:
State: **`balance` is not equal to 0, `count` is 0, `n` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is between 1 and `n`, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated, where `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
