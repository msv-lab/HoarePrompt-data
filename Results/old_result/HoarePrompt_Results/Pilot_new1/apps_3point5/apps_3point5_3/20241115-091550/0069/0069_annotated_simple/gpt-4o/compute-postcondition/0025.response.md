Postcondition: ***The loop updates the `prefix_balances` list by calculating the cumulative sum of 1 if the corresponding character in string `s` is '0' and -1 otherwise up to the index `i`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute, and `prefix_balances` remains a list of zeros with a length of 1. Additionally, `balance` is equal to 0. If `x` is in the `prefix_balances` list, then -1 is appended to the `results` list. If `x` is not in the `prefix_balances` list, then 0 is appended to the `results` list.***
