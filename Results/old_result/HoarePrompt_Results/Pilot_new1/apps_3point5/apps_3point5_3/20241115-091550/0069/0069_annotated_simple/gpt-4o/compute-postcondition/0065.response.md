According to the code, the loop will execute if n is greater than or equal to 1. Before the loop starts, the prefix_balances array should be non-empty since the loop iterates over this array. The balance being not equal to 0 does not affect the loop execution. Since the loop initializes `count` to 0, it does not need to be adjusted before the loop starts.
State: **If n is greater than or equal to 1, prefix_balances array is non-empty**
