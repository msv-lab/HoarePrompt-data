Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input for the number of test cases, the length of the string, the desired balance, and the binary string.
2. It calculates the balance of the string and then calculates the prefix balances based on the given conditions.
3. The program then correctly determines the number of prefixes with the desired balance and handles cases where there are infinite prefixes by outputting -1.
4. The logic for checking the balance and calculating the number of prefixes is implemented correctly based on the problem description.
5. The program covers edge cases such as when the length of the string is less than or equal to 0.
6. The annotations provided in the code also accurately describe the logic and the state of the program at different points.
