Postcondition: ***T is a positive integer, n and x are input integers, s is assigned the input string, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, and balance is the result of subtracting the count of '1' from the count of '0' in s. The balance is not equal to x. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) is 0, then the program prints -1. Otherwise, if ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) is not 0, the program prints ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). This covers all possible scenarios of the if else block, ensuring the correct output based on the given conditions.***
