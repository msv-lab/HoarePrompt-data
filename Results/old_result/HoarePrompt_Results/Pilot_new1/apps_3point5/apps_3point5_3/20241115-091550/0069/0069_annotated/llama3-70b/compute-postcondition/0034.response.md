Postcondition: ***`T` is T-1 + 1, `n` and `x` are assigned values based on the input, `cnt0` is the count of '0' in string `s`, `cnt1` is the count of '1' in string `s`, `s` is assigned the input string, `cnt0` and `cnt1` are assigned the count of '0' and '1' in string `s` respectively, `balance` is the result of count of '0' - count of '1'. If balance equals `x`, then `n + 1` is printed. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is printed. This covers all possible scenarios of the program execution based on the initial input values and ensures the correct output is produced according to the conditions specified in the code.***
