According to the code, the loop will execute T number of times. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `T` must be a positive integer. Since the loop does not use the loop variable `i`, `index` being 1 does not affect the loop execution. The `results` list being empty also does not impact the loop execution.
State: **`T` is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list**
