Output State: **`T` remains greater than 0, `n` is an integer value greater than or equal to 1, `s` is assigned a valid value from `data`, `balance` is calculated based on '0's and '1's in `s`, `index` is defined, `i` is 2, `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the new value of `i` and the condition `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1), `prefix_balances[i]` is assigned the value of `prefix_balances[i - 1] + (1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`**
