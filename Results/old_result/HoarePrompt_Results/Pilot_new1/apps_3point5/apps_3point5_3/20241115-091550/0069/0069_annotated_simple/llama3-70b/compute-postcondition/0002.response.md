Example Answer: 
`n` and `x` are assigned values from the input using `map(int, input().split())`. The input is split by spaces, converted to integers, and assigned to `n` and `x`. The values of `n` and `x` depend on the input given. Therefore, the Output State is: T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer.
Output State: **T is a positive integer, `n` is an input integer, `x` is an input integer**
