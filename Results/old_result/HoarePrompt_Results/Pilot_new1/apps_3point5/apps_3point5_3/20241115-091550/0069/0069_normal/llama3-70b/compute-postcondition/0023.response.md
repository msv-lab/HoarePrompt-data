Postcondition: ***T - 1 is a positive integer, n and x are input integers, s is assigned the input string, cnt0 is the count of '0' in s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in s, balance is the result of subtracting the count of '1' from the count of '0' in s. If (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0, then -1 is printed. Otherwise, ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) is printed.***
