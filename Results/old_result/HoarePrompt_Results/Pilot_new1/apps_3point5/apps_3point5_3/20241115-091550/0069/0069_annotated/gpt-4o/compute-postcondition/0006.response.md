Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(data[index])`, where `data[index]` retrieves the value at the index specified in the list `data` and converts it to an integer. The value of `index` is 1, so `n` will be assigned the value at index 1 in the `data` list as an integer. Other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `T` is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, and `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list.
Output State: **`T` is a positive integer, `index` is 1, `results` is an empty list, `n` is the integer value at index 1 of the `data` list**
