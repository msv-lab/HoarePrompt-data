You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determineg the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and the annotations of the code which are provided as comments . If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print "True"; otherwise, print "False". Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not do what the problem descriptions says. The annotationssummarise what the code returns and might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the code not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given string $s$ of length $n$ consisting of 0-s and 1-s. You build an infinite string $t$ as a concatenation of an infinite number of strings $s$, or $t = ssss \dots$ For example, if $s =$ 10010, then $t =$ 100101001010010...

Calculate the number of prefixes of $t$ with balance equal to $x$. The balance of some string $q$ is equal to $cnt_{0, q} - cnt_{1, q}$, where $cnt_{0, q}$ is the number of occurrences of 0 in $q$, and $cnt_{1, q}$ is the number of occurrences of 1 in $q$. The number of such prefixes can be infinite; if it is so, you must say that.

A prefix is a string consisting of several first letters of a given string, without any reorders. An empty prefix is also a valid prefix. For example, the string "abcd" has 5 prefixes: empty string, "a", "ab", "abc" and "abcd".


-----Input-----

The first line contains the single integer $T$ ($1 \le T \le 100$) — the number of test cases.

Next $2T$ lines contain descriptions of test cases — two lines per test case. The first line contains two integers $n$ and $x$ ($1 \le n \le 10^5$, $-10^9 \le x \le 10^9$) — the length of string $s$ and the desired balance, respectively.

The second line contains the binary string $s$ ($|s| = n$, $s_i \in \{\text{0}, \text{1}\}$).

It's guaranteed that the total sum of $n$ doesn't exceed $10^5$.


-----Output-----

Print $T$ integers — one per test case. For each test case print the number of prefixes or $-1$ if there is an infinite number of such prefixes.


-----Example-----
Input
4
6 10
010010
5 3
10101
1 0
0
2 0
01

Output
3
0
1
-1



-----Note-----

In the first test case, there are 3 good prefixes of $t$: with length $28$, $30$ and $32$.
Annotated Program:
```
def func():
    T = int(input())
    for _ in range(T):
        n, x = map(int, input().split())
        
        s = input()
        
        cnt0, cnt1 = s.count('0'), s.count('1')
        
        balance = cnt0 - cnt1
        
        if balance == x:
            print(n + 1)
        elif (x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1) == 0:
            print(-1)
        else:
            print((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: Output State: 
    #If T is greater than 0, the loop will execute T times. For each iteration, n and x are assigned values based on the input, s is assigned the input string, cnt0 is the count of '0' in string s, cnt1 is the count of '1' in string s, and balance is calculated as cnt0 - cnt1. Depending on the values of balance and x, the program will print n + 1, -1, or ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1) accordingly. This covers all possible scenarios of the program execution based on the initial input values and ensures the correct output is produced according to the conditions specified in the code.
    #
    #If T is 0 or negative, the loop will not execute, and no values will be assigned to n, x, s, cnt0, cnt1, or balance.
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input and then iterates `T` times. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, a string `s`, calculates the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, and computes a balance based on the counts. Depending on the relationship between `balance` and `x`, the function prints `n + 1`, -1, or a calculated value. If `T` is 0 or negative, the loop does not execute, and no values are processed. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
```


I want you to try to see if the code does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations. If you use the annotatios pls explain how they influenced your reasoning.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly. You can also say how the annotations influenced your reasoning.
