According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as there are more elements in the `results` list to iterate over. At the end of the last iteration, `prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `results` is a list with at least 2 elements, `T` is greater than 0. For the loop to execute one more time, the `results` list must have at least 3 elements.
State: **`prefix_balances` is a list with at least 1 element, `results` is a list with at least 3 elements, `T` is greater than 0**
