Correctness: False

The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case. The code fails to handle the case where there is an infinite number of prefixes with the desired balance. The code only checks for specific conditions related to balance and x, but it does not consider the possibility of an infinite number of prefixes. This is evident in the annotation that mentions printing -1 if there is an infinite number of prefixes, but the code does not implement this logic. Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not cover all scenarios as specified in the problem description.
