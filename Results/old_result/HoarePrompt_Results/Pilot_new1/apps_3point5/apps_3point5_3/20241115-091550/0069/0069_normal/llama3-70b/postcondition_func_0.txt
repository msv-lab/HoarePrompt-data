The function `func` reads an integer `T` from input and then iterates `T` times. For each iteration, it reads two integers `n` and `x`, a string `s`, calculates the count of '0's and '1's in `s`, and computes the balance by subtracting the count of '1's from the count of '0's. Depending on the relationship between `balance` and `x`, the function outputs different values. If `balance` is equal to `x`, it outputs `n + 1`. If ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) is 0, it outputs -1. Otherwise, if ((x - balance) % (cnt0 - cnt1)) is not 0, it outputs ((x - balance) // (cnt0 - cnt1) + 1). The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
