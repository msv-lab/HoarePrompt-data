Postcondition: ***`n` is at least 1, `T` remains greater than 0, `s` is assigned a valid value from `data`, `balance` is calculated based on '0's and '1's in `s`, `index` is defined, `i` is the current iteration count, and `prefix_balances[i]` is updated based on the previous value of `prefix_balances[i - 1]` and the condition `(1 if s[i - 1] == '0' else -1)`. If `n` is less than or equal to 0, the loop does not execute. The balance is equal to 0, and `x` is not in `prefix_balances`***
