According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in `prefix_balances`. If there are more elements in `prefix_balances`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `count` is an integer and there are more elements in `prefix_balances`. To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `prefix_balances` needs to be considered. 
State: **`count` is an integer and there are still more elements in `prefix_balances`**
