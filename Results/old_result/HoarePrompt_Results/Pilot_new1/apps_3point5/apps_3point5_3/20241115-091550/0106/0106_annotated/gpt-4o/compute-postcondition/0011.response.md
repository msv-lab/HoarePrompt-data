Output State: **`block_b` and `floor_b` are assigned the values returned by the `get_location` function when `b` is passed as an argument. If `floor_a` is equal to 1, then `time_to_exit` is 0. Otherwise, if `floor_a` is not equal to 1, `time_to_exit` is calculated as 10 + (`floor_a` - 1); `direct_walk_time` is calculated as the absolute difference between `block_a` and `block_b`, modulo `n`, multiplied by 15. `reverse_walk_time` is calculated as (n - abs(block_a - block_b)) % n * 15. `min_walk_time` is assigned the minimum value between `direct_walk_time` and `reverse_walk_time`. `time_to_target_floor` is calculated as (floor_b - 1) * 5. `total_time` is assigned the sum of `time_to_exit`, `min_walk_time`, and `time_to_target_floor`.**
