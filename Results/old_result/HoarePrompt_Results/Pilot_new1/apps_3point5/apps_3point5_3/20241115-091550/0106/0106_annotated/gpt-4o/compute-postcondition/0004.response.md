The function `get_location` accepts a parameter `apartment`. The precondition for the function is that `n`, `m`, and `k` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n, m, k ≤ 1000, and `a` and `b` are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a, b ≤ n·m·k and a ≠ b. 

After executing the function body, the program returns the values of 'block' and 'floor' based on the calculations using the initial values of 'apartment', 'm', and 'k'. Therefore, the functionality of the function `get_location` is to accept an integer `apartment` and calculate and return the values of 'block' and 'floor' based on specific calculations using the initial values of 'apartment', 'm', and 'k'.
