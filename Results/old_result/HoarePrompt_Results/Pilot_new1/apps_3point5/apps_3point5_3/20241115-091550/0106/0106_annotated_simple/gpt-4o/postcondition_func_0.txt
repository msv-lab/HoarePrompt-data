The function `func_1` accepts five positive integer parameters `n`, `m`, `k`, `a`, and `b`, calculates the total time required for a journey based on these parameters, and returns the total time. The function first determines the time it takes to exit a building based on the starting floor, then calculates the time for a direct and reverse walk between two blocks, followed by the time to reach the target floor. The total time is the sum of all these time components.
