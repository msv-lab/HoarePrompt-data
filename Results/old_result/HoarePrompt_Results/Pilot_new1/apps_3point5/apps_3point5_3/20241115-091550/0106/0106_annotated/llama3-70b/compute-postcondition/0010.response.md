Output State: **`n`, `m`, `k` are assigned the integer values from the input split, `a` and `b` are assigned the integer values from the input split, `a_floor` is calculated based on the formula `a_block = (a - 1) // (m * k) + 1`, `b_floor` is calculated based on the formula `(b - 1) % m + 1`, `b_block = (b - 1) // (m * k) + 1, `min_block_time` is calculated as the minimum of the absolute difference between `a_block` and `b_block` and `n - abs(a_block - b_block)` multiplied by 15. The condition `(a_floor > b_floor)` is false, so the program enters the else block. `min_floor_time` is calculated as `(b_floor - a_floor) * 5 + 10`.**
