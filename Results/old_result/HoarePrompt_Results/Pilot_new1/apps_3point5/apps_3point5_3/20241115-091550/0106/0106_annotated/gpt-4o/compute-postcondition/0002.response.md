Example Answer:
The value of `floor` is calculated by dividing `floor_within_block` by `k` and adding 1. The value of `floor_within_block` is dependent on the initial values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`, which are not provided. Therefore, the output state is: the value of `floor` is calculated based on the initial values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`.
Output State: **the value of `floor` is calculated based on the initial values of `apartment`, `m`, and `k`**
