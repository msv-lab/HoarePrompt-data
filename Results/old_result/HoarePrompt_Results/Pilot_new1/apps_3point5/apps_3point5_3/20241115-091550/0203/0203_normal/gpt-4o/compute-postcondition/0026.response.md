Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of 'D' and 'R' characters, `d_index` is assigned the value popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is assigned the value popped from `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, `d_queue` is appended with `d_index + n`. If `d_index` is greater than or equal to `r_index`, `r_queue` is appended with `r_index + n`.***
