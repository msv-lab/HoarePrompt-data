Output State: **If the list `fractions` is empty, the loop does not execute, and both `depublicans` and `remocrats` remain 0. If the list contains at least one fraction, the loop iterates through each fraction, incrementing either `depublicans` or `remocrats` based on the value of the fraction ('D' or not). After the loop execution, `depublicans` contains the count of 'D' fractions, `remocrats` contains the count of non-'D' fractions, and `n` remains an input integer.**
