Example Answer: 
The code pops the first index from the d_queue and assigns it to d_index. Since d_queue contains the indices of 'D' characters in the votes string, after this operation, the first index of 'D' character is removed from d_queue and assigned to d_index. The states of other variables are not affected.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n consisting of characters 'D' or 'R', d_queue may be updated with remaining indices of 'D' characters, r_queue remains unchanged, d_index contains the index of the popped 'D' character**
