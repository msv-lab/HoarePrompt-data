Example Answer:
`i+1` is appended to `r_queue`, and the previous state of `r_queue` is updated. The initial state of other variables remains the same. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n+1, d_queue and r_queue are updated, i+1 is appended to d_queue or r_queue.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, votes is a string of length n+1, d_queue and r_queue are updated, i+1 is appended to d_queue or r_queue**
