Postcondition: ***`votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index, `r_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters not 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index, `d_index` is the index of the first 'D' character popped from `d_queue`, `r_index` is the index of the first non-'D' character popped from `r_queue`. If `d_index` is less than `r_index`, then `d_queue` appends the value `d_index + n`. Otherwise, `r_queue` appends the value of `r_index + n`. This handles all possible scenarios where the program fragment can execute based on the conditions of `d_index` and `r_index`.***
