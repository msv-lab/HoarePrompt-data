Example Answer:
`remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is unknown, so the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with more characters, `remocrats` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with more characters, `remocrats` is increased by 1**
