Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `votes` is a string of length at least 1 containing only 'D' and 'R' characters. The loop processes each character in `votes` and appends the index to either `d_queue` or `r_queue` based on the character value. If there are no 'D' characters in `votes`, `d_queue` remains empty. If there are no 'R' characters in `votes`, `r_queue` remains empty.**
