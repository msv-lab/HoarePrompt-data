Output State: **If both d_queue and r_queue are non-empty, the loop will continue to execute. d_index will be updated with the index of the popped 'D' character, and r_index will be updated with the index of the popped 'R' character. If d_index is less than r_index, d_queue will be updated by appending d_index + n. If d_index is not less than r_index, r_queue will be updated by appending r_index + n. The loop will continue to execute as long as both d_queue and r_queue are non-empty. If either d_queue or r_queue becomes empty, the loop will terminate.**
