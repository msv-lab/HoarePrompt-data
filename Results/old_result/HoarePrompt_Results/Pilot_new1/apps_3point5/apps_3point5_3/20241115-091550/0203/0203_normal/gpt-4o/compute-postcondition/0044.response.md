Output State: **Since the code snippet only prints 'R', there is no change in the state of the variables. Therefore, the output state remains the same: If `d_queue` is empty, then `r_queue` may or may not be empty. The values of `d_index` and `r_index` will be updated based on the popped values from the queues. The loop control variables `d_queue` and `r_queue` will be empty if there are no 'D' or 'R' characters in `votes` respectively.**
