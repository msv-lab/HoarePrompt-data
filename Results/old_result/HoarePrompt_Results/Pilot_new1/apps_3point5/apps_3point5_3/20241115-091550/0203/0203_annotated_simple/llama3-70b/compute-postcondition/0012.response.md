Example Answer:
`remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `remocrats` is unknown, so after execution, `remocrats` increases by 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `depublicans` and `remocrats` are integers representing the count of 'D' and non-'D' fractions respectively, `remocrats` increased by 1.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` and `remocrats` are integers representing the count of 'D' and non-'D' fractions respectively, `remocrats` increased by 1**
