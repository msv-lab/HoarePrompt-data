Output State: **`fractions` is a list of fractions, `depublicans` is an integer representing the count of 'D' fractions, `remocrats` is an integer representing the count of non-'D' fractions, `n` is an integer. The loop has iterated through each fraction, incrementing `depublicans` or `remocrats` accordingly. `depublicans` is greater than `remocrats`. 'D' is printed.**
