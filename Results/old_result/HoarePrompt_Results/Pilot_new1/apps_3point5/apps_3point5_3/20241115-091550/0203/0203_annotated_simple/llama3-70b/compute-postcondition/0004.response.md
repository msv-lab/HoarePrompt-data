According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the fractions list. If the list has at least 1 fraction, the loop executes. Before the loop starts, the states that need to be adjusted are `n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, and `fraction` is the first fraction in the list.
State: **`n` is an input integer, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0, `fraction` is the first fraction in the list**
