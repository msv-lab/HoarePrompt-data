Example Answer:
`remocrats` is assigned the value `0`. Since `remocrats` is the only variable affected, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a string, `depublicans` is 0, `remocrats` is 0**
