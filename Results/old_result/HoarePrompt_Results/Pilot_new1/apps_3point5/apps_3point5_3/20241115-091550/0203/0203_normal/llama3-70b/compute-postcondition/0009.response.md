Postcondition: ***`n` is an input integer. If `fraction` is 'D', `depublicans` is incremented by 1 and `remocrats` remains 0. If `fraction` is not 'D', `remocrats` is incremented by 1 and `depublicans` remains 0. The list `fractions` contains at least 1 fraction, and `fraction` is the first fraction in the list. The overall state of the program after the if-else block execution covers all edge cases of `fraction` being 'D' or not, ensuring that either `depublicans` or `remocrats` is updated accordingly.***
