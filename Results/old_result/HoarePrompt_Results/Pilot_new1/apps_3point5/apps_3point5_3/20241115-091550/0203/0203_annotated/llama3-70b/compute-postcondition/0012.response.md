Example Answer:
`remocrats` is incremented by 1. The previous values of `remocrats` and `depublicans` are either 1 and 0 or 0 and 1. After execution, `remocrats` will be either 1 or 2, and the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with more characters, either `depublicans` is 1 and `remocrats` is 0 or `depublicans` is 0 and `remocrats` is either 1 or 2.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `fractions` is a non-empty string with more characters, either `depublicans` is 1 and `remocrats` is 0 or `depublicans` is 0 and `remocrats` is either 1 or 2**
