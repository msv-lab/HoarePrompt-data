Output State: **If both 'D' and 'R' characters are present in `votes`, the loop will continue to execute. After the loop finishes, `d_queue` and `r_queue` may have different lengths depending on the comparisons between `d_index` and `r_index`. The values of `d_index` and `r_index` will be updated based on the popped values from the queues. The loop control variables `d_queue` and `r_queue` will be empty if there are no 'D' or 'R' characters in `votes` respectively.**
