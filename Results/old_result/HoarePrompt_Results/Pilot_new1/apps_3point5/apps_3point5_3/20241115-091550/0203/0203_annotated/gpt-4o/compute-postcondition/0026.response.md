Postcondition: ***`votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index, `r_queue` is a list containing the indices of characters not 'D' in `votes` excluding the popped index. If the index of character 'D' is less than the index of character not 'D', then `d_queue` appends `d_index + n`. Otherwise, if the index of 'D' is not less than the index of other characters in `votes`, then `r_queue` appends `r_index + n`. This covers all possible scenarios involving the comparison of the indices and the appropriate appending to the respective queues.***
