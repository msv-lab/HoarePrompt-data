Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a string `votes` from the user input. It then processes the votes to create queues for 'D' and 'R' characters based on their indices. After that, it simulates a voting process by popping indices from both queues and updating them based on certain conditions until one of the queues becomes empty. Finally, it prints 'D' if the 'D' queue is not empty, and 'R' if it is empty. The function does not have an explicit return value. **
