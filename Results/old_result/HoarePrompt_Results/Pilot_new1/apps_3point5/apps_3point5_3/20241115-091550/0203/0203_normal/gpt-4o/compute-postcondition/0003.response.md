Example Answer: 
After executing the code snippet, a new empty list `r_queue` is created. The variables `n`, `votes`, and `d_queue` remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue is an empty list, r_queue is an empty list.
Output State: **n is an input integer, votes is a string of length n containing only 'D' and 'R' characters, d_queue is an empty list, r_queue is an empty list**
