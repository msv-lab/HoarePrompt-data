Postcondition: ***`votes` is a string based on user input, `d_queue` is a list containing the index `i` if the first character of `votes` is 'D', `r_queue` is a list containing the index `i` if the first character of `votes` is not 'D', `i` is 0, `v` is the first character in the `votes` string. If the first character of `votes` is 'D', the index `i` is appended to `d_queue`. If the first character of `votes` is not 'D', the index `i` is appended to `r_queue`.***
