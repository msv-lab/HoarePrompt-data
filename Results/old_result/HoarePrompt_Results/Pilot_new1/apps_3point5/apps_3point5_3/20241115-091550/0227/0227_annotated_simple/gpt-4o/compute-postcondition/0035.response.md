Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the elements of list `a` with at least 1 element, `x` is the next element in the `assigned` list, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 0, and `can_form` is True. If `a[i] - x` is in `assigned`, then `can_form` is set to True and the loop is terminated. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of the variables.***
