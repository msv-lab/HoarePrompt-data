Example Answer:
`m` is assigned the value 1. The value of `m` is now 1. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9) sorted in ascending order, `m` is 1**
