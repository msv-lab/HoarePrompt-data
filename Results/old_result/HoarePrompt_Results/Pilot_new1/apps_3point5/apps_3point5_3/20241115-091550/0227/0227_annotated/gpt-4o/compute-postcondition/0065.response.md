Postcondition: ***`assigned` has at least 1 element. If the difference between `a[i]` and any element in `assigned` is present in `assigned`, `can_form` is True. `i` is incremented to the next index after the last iteration, `m` is increased by 1. If the condition is met, the loop breaks. If `assigned` is empty, the loop does not execute and `can_form` remains False. If `can_form` is False, then `m` is increased by 1.***
