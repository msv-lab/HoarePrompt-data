The function `func` reads an integer `n`, followed by a list of `n` distinct positive integers in ascending order. It then iterates through the list and increments `m` by 1 if the current element is not twice the value of the previous element. The function prints the final value of `m` if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. If `n` is 1, the loop does not execute, and `m` remains 1.
