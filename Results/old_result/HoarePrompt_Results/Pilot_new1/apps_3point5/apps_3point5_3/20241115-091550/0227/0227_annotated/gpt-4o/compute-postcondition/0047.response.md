Example Answer: 
The variable `can_form` is assigned the value `False`. This assignment does not affect the other variables. Therefore, the Output State is: `assigned` is updated with the value `a[i+1]`, `can_form` is False, `i` is incremented to the next index after the last iteration, `m` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`assigned` is updated with the value `a[i+1]`, `can_form` is False, `i` is incremented to the next index after the last iteration, `m` is increased by 1**
