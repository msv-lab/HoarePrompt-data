Output State: **`assigned` contains the elements of list `a` one by one, `m` is either increased by 1 or remains 1, `n` is greater than 1, and `can_form` is True if the difference between the element at index `i` of list `a` and `x` is in `assigned` for any `x` in `assigned`, otherwise `can_form` remains False. If the loop does not execute, `can_form` remains False.**
