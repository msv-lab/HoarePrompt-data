According to the code, the loop will execute as long as i is less than n. At the end of the last iteration, n is greater than 1 and i is n-1. Since i is n-1, to execute the loop one more time, i needs to be adjusted to n-2. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **n is greater than 1, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order. If a[i] is not equal to a[i - 1] * 2, then m is increased by 1. In all cases, m is either 2 or 3, and i is n-2**
