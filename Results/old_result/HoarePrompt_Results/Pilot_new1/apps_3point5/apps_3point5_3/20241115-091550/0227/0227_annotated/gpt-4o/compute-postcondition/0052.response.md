Postcondition: ***`assigned` has at least 1 element, `can_form` is True if the difference between `a[i]` and the first element in `assigned` is present in `assigned`, `i` is incremented to the next index after the last iteration, `m` is increased by 1. If the condition in the if statement is met, the loop or if statement breaks. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables.***
