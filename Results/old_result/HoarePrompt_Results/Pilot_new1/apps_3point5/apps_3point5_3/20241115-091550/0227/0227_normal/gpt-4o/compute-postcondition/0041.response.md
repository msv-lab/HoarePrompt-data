Output State: **If assigned is empty, the loop does not execute. Otherwise, after the loop executes, can_form is True if there exists a pair of elements x and y in assigned such that a[i] = x + y, where x is the element at index i in list a and y is an element in assigned. If no such pair exists, can_form remains False.**
