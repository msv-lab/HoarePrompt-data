Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values entered as input after converting them to integers. The values entered are distinct positive integers, so the list `a` contains those distinct positive integers. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a positive integer, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers.
Output State: **n is a positive integer, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers**
