Postcondition: ***n is greater than 1, a is a list of distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is an integer. If a[i] is not equal to twice the value of a[i - 1], then m is incremented by 1. The postcondition covers the scenario where the condition is met and m is increased, ensuring the uniqueness and order of the positive integers in the list a.***
