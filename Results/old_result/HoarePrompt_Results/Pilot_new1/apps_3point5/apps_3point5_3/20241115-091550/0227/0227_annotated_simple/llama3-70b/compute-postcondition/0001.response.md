Example Answer:
The list `a` is assigned the values obtained by mapping the integers from the input split by space. The length of the list `a` is `n`, which is a positive integer between 1 and 23, and the elements of the list are distinct positive integers between 1 and 10^9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9).
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer (1 ≤ n ≤ 23), `a` is a list of n distinct positive integers (1 ≤ a_k ≤ 10^9)**
