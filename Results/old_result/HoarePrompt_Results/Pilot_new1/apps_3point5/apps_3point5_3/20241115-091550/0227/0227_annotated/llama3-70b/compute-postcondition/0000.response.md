Example Answer:
`n` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The previous values of `a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n}` are unknown, so the output state is: **n is a positive integer. a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers after input is taken.**
Output State: **n is a positive integer. a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers after input is taken.**
