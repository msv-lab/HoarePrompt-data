Output State: **`assigned` has at least 1 element, `can_form` is True, `i` is incremented to the next index after the last iteration, `m` is increased by 1, `x` is the first element in `assigned`, and the difference between `a[i]` and `x` is present in `assigned` and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
