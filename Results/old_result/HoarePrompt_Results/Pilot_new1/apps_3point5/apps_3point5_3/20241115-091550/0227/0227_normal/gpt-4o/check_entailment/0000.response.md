Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in the number of elements `n` and a list of distinct positive integers `a`. The function sorts the list `a` and then iterates through each element to check if it can be formed by adding two elements from the list that are already assigned. If an element cannot be formed, the counter `m` is incremented. Finally, the function returns the count of times `can_form` was False during the iteration.

The code seems to correctly implement the logic described in the problem statement. It handles the scenario where each element in the sequence can be formed by adding two elements from the list that are already assigned. The output hints also align with the code's functionality, supporting the conclusion that the code is correct. Since no edge cases or scenarios where the code might fail to meet the requirements have been identified, the correctness of the code is deemed to be true.
