Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. It reads an integer n and a list of distinct positive integers, sorts the list, and iterates through the elements to increment a counter m if an element is not twice the previous element. Finally, it prints m if it is less than or equal to 23; otherwise, it prints -1. The code handles all cases where n is greater than or equal to 1 and where the input list is sorted in ascending order. The annotations also accurately describe the behavior of the code and provide examples of cases where the code may not work as expected, but upon further examination, the code covers those cases as well.
