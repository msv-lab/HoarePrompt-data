Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly determines the minimum number of variables `m` required to perform the described sequence of operations. It sorts the given list of integers in ascending order and then iterates through the list to check if each element is twice the previous element. If not, it increments `m`. The program then prints the value of `m` as long as it is less than or equal to 23, otherwise it prints -1. The logic of the program aligns with the problem description and it handles all potential cases.
