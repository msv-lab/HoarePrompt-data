According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 1 and `i` is n-2. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1 and `n` should be greater than 2. Additionally, if `a[i]` is not equal to `a[i - 1] * 2`, then `m` is increased by 1. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, `m` should be 3 and the condition `a[i] != a[i - 1] * 2` should be satisfied.
State: **n is greater than 2, a_1, a_2, ..., a_{n} are distinct positive integers sorted in ascending order, m is 3, i is n-1**
