Postcondition: ***`assigned` contains the next element of list `a`, `m` is 1, `n` is greater than 1, `can_form` is True, `x` is the next element of list `a`, and the difference between the element at index `i` of list `a` and `x` is in `assigned`. If the condition `a[i] - x in assigned` is satisfied, `can_form` is set to True, and the loop is terminated. Otherwise, the program continues with the initial state unchanged.***
