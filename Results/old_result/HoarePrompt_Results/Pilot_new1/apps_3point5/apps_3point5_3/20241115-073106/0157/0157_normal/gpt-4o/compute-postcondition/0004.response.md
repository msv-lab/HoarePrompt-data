Example Answer:
`total_fruits` is calculated by multiplying `max_lemons` by 1, 2, and 4 and adding the results. `max_lemons` is the minimum of a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4. Therefore, the output state is: `a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4, and `total_fruits` is the sum of `max_lemons` multiplied by 1, 2, and 4.
Output State: **`a` is an input positive integer, `b` is an input integer, `c` is an input integer, `max_lemons` is the minimum of a, b divided by 2, and c divided by 4, `total_fruits` is the sum of `max_lemons` multiplied by 1, 2, and 4**
