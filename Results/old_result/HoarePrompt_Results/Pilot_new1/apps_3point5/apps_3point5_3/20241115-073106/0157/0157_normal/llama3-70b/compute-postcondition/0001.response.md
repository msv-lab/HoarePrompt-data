Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The variables `a` and `c` are not affected, so the output state is: a, b, and c are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000.
Output State: **a, b, and c are positive integers such that 1 ≤ a ≤ 1000, 1 ≤ b ≤ 1000, and 1 ≤ c ≤ 1000**
