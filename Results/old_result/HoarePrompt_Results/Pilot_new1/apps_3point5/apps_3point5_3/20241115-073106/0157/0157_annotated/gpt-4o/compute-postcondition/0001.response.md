Example Answer:
`b` is assigned the value `int(input())`, where `input` accepts an input and `int` converts it to an integer. The value of `a` is between 1 and 1000, and `b` is an input integer. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer.
Output State: **`a` is an input integer between 1 and 1000, `b` is an input integer**
