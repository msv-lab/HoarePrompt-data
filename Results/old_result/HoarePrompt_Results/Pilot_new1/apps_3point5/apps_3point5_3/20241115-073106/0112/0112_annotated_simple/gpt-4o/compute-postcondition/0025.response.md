According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more digits in the list `digits`. At the end of the last iteration, `used_cubes` will have at least one `True` value, `digits` will still contain at least 1 digit, `digit` will remain as the first digit in the list, `found` will be `True` if the condition is met at least once, and `n` will remain greater than 0. If the condition is not met and `found` is `False`, the loop will not execute again.

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the list `digits` needs to have more than 1 digit, and the `digit` variable needs to move to the next digit in the list.
State: **After the execution of the if-else block, the variable `used_cubes` will have at least one `True` value if the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied. The variable `digits` will still contain at least 2 digits. The variable `digit` will be the next digit in the list. The variable `found` will be `True` if the condition is met at least once during the loop execution. The variable `n` will remain greater than 0.**
