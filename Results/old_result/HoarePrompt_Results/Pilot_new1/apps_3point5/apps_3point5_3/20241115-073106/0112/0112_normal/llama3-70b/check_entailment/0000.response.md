Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code reads the number of cubes Masha has and the digits on each face of the cubes. It then extracts all the unique digits from the cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts the digits in descending order, concatenates them into a single integer, and prints the resulting maximum number.

The code correctly follows the problem description as it extracts all unique digits from the cubes and forms the maximum number possible. The output examples provided in the problem description also align with the code's functionality. Therefore, the code is correct for all potential cases.
