According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are more digits to iterate over in the list `digits`. At the end of the last iteration, `found` is False, `digits` still contains at least 2 digits, `digit` is the next digit in the list, `used_cubes` will have at least one `True` value if the condition is satisfied, `n` remains greater than 0. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the `digit` should be the next digit in the list after the current one, and `used_cubes` should still have at least one `True` value.
State: **`found` is False, `digits` still contains at least 2 digits, `digit` is the next digit in the list, `used_cubes` still has at least one `True` value, `n` remains greater than 0**
