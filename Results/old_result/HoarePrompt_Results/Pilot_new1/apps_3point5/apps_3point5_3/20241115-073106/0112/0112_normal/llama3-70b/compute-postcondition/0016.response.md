The function `func` does not accept any parameters. The function does not return any value, it performs the following actions:
1. Generates 3 random cubes, each represented by a list of 6 integers between 0 and 9.
2. Checks if the sum of the integers in the first cube is greater than the sum of the integers in the second cube.
3. If the condition is met, it returns the first cube; otherwise, it returns the second cube.
