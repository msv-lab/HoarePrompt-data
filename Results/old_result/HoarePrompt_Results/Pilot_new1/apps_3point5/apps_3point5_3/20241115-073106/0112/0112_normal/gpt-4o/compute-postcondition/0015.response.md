According to the code, the loop can execute again as long as `i` is less than the length of `used_cubes`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True if not already used and if the `digit` is in the list of cube faces at index `i`, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the loop or if statement is exited, and `i` is less than the length of `used_cubes`. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True if not already used and if the `digit` is in the list of cube faces at index `i`, `used_cubes[i]` is set to True, `found` is True, and the loop or if statement is exited, `i+1` is less than the length of `used_cubes`**
