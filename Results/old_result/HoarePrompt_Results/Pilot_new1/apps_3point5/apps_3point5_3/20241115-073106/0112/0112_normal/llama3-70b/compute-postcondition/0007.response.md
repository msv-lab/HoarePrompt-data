According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the number of cubes in the list. If there are at least 3 cubes, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, n is an input integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 2 cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube. So for the loop to execute one more time, the list of cubes must have at least 3 cubes.
State: **n is an input integer, cubes is a list of cubes with at least 3 cubes, digits is a set containing the string representation of each digit in the first cube**
