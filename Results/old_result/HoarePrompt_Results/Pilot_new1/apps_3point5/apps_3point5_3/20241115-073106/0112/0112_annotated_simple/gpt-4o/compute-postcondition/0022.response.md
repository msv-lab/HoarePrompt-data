Postcondition: ***`used_cubes` will have at least one `True` value if the condition `not used_cubes[i] and digit in cube_faces[i]` is satisfied. `digits` will still contain at least 1 digit. `digit` will remain as the first digit in the list. `found` will be `True` if the condition is met at least once during the loop execution. `n` will remain greater than 0. If the list `used_cubes` is initially all `True` or if the list `cube_faces` is empty, the loop will not execute, leaving all variables unchanged.***
