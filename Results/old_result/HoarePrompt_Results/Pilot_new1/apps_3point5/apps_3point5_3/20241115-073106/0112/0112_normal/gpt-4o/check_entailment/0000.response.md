Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The `can_form_number` function is not correctly implemented as it does not consider the constraints mentioned in the problem description. It only checks if the individual digits of the number can be formed using the cube faces, but it does not consider the fact that Masha can't make digit 6 from digit 9 and vice versa. This means that the function does not accurately reflect the requirements of the problem description, leading to incorrect results.
- Additionally, the `func_1` function iterates to find the smallest integer x for which `can_form_number(x)` returns false, but since the `can_form_number` function is flawed, the overall logic of the program is incorrect.

Therefore, the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, making the correctness **False**.
