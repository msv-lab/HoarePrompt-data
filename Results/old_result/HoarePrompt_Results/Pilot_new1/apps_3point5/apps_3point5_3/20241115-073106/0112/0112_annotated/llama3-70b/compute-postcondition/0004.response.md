The code iterates through each digit in the cube, converts it to a string, and updates the `digits` set with each digit. Since the initial state mentions that `digits` is an empty set, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, and `cube` is the first cube in the list, the set `digits` will contain all the individual digits of the first cube in string format.

Output State: **`digits` is a set containing the individual digits of the first cube in string format, `cubes` is a list of cubes with at least 1 cube, `cube` is the first cube in the list**
