The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `n` and `cubes`. `n` is an integer such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 3, and `cubes` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the digits on the faces of a cube (0 ≤ a_{i}_{j} ≤ 9). The function iterates through numbers starting from 0 until `can_form_number(x + 1)` returns false, and then returns the number of iterations. If `can_form_number(1)` returns false initially, the function returns 0. The actual functionality is to calculate the number of iterations until a certain condition is met, as opposed to what the annotations suggest.
