Functionality: **The function can_form_number accepts a positive integer num and checks if the individual digits of num can be formed using the cube faces provided in cube_faces. It iterates through each digit and tries to match it with the cube faces. If a match is found for each digit, the function returns True; otherwise, it returns False. However, there is a potential issue where if there are not enough cube faces in cube_faces (less than n), the function may encounter an index out of range error.**
