Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from input, then reads `n` lists of integers, each representing a cube. It extracts all unique digits from these cubes, removes '0' if present, sorts them in descending order, concatenates them into a single number, and prints the maximum number formed by these digits. If the input list `cubes` is empty, the function will not execute the for loop and will result in an empty set of `digits`. **
