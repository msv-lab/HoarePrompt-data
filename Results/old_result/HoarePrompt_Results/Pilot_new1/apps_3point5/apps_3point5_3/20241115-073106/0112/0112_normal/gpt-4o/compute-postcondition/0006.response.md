Example Answer:
The element at index `i` in `used_cubes` is set to True. The previous state of `used_cubes` is that all elements are initialized to False. After execution, the element at index `i` will be True. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is False.
Output State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where the element at index `i` is True, `digit` is the first digit in the `digits` list, `found` is False**
