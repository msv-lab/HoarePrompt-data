Example Answer:
The variable `digits` is assigned the list of string representations of the integer `num`. Since `num` is not given in the initial state, we cannot determine the exact values of `digits` at this point. Therefore, the output state is: **Precondition**: **n is an integer representing the number of cubes, such that 1 <= n <= 3. cube_faces is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube. Each integer in cube_faces is between 0 and 9 (inclusive)**, `digits` is a list of string representations of an unknown integer.
