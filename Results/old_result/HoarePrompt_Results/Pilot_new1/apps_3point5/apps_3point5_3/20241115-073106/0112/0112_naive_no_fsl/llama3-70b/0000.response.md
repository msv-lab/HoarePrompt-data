Correctness: False

The given program does not handle the case where there are duplicate digits in the cubes. The program uses a set to store the unique digits, but this will not work correctly if there are duplicate digits in the cubes. For example, if the input is:
```
3
1 1 2 3 4 5
6 7 8 9 0 1
2 3 4 5 6 7
```
The program will output 987654321, which is incorrect because there are two 1s in the cubes, so the maximum number that can be formed is 87654321.

Therefore, the program is incorrect as it does not handle duplicate digits in the cubes.
