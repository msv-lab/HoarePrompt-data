According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list `digits`. If there are more digits left in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where elements are True if matched, `found` is True if a match was found, or False if not. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next digit in the list `digits` needs to be selected for iteration. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the index of the digit in the list `digits`. 

State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where elements are True if matched, `found` is True if a match was found, or False if not, index of the next digit in `digits`**
