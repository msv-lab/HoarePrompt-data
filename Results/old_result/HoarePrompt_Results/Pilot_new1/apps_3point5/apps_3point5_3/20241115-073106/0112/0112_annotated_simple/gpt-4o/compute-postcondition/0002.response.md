According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list. If the list has at least 1 digit, the loop will execute. Since all elements in the `used_cubes` list are initially `False`, it needs to be adjusted so that the `digits` list has at least 1 digit, and the `digit` variable is the first digit in the list.
State: **All elements in the list `used_cubes` are `False`, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list**
