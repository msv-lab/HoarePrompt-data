According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the `digits` list and the index of the next digit. If the index is less than the length of the `digits` list, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where elements are True if matched, `found` is False, index of the next digit in `digits`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the index needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`num` is a positive integer, `digits` is a list of individual digits of `num`, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements where elements are True if matched, `found` is False, index of the next digit in `digits` is incremented by 1**
