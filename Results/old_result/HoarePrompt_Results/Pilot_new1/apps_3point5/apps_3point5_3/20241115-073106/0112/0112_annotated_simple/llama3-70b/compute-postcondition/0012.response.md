Example Answer: 
The code removes '0' from the set `digits`. Since '0' was included in `digits` based on the initial state, after execution, '0' is removed from `digits`. Therefore, the Output State is: If cubes is an empty list, digits remains an empty set. If cubes contains at least one sublist, digits contains all the unique digits from all the cubes in the list cubes.
Output State: **If cubes is an empty list, digits remains an empty set. If cubes contains at least one sublist, digits contains all the unique digits from all the cubes in the list cubes**
