The function `can_form_number` accepts a parameter `num`. The precondition for `num` is that it is an integer representing the number of cubes, such that 1 <= n <= 3. `cube_faces` is a list of n lists, where each inner list contains 6 integers representing the numbers on the faces of the corresponding cube. Each integer in `cube_faces` is between 0 and 9 (inclusive).

After executing the function body, there are two possible cases:
Case_1: The function returns a list `used_cubes` of `n` elements where each element is True if `used_cubes[i]` was False and the corresponding `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`. `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit. If the loop does not execute at all, all variables remain unchanged. If `found` is False at any point, the program returns False.
Case_2: The program returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `can_form_number` is to accept an integer `num` and a list `cube_faces` meeting the specified constraints, and determine if the cubes can form the number based on the conditions specified in the two cases.
