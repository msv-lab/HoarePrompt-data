According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `i` is less than `n`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with the element at index `i+1` set to True, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `i` is 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to continue the loop.
- If `used_cubes[i]` is False and `digit` is in `cube_faces[i]`, then `used_cubes[i]` should be set to True and `found` should be set to True. If this condition is not met, the loop will continue without breaking out.

State: **`used_cubes` is a list of `n` elements with the element at index `i+2` set to True, `digits` is a list of digits with at least 1 digit, `digit` is the first digit in the list, `found` is True, `i` is 2**
