Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly handles the case where the difference between neighboring elements is 0 by checking if `c` is equal to 0. If `c` is 0, it verifies if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES' if they are equal, otherwise 'NO'.
2. For cases where the difference between neighboring elements is not 0, the program uses the condition `((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0)` to determine if Vasya's favorite number `b` appears in the sequence. It checks if the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and if the division result is non-negative, printing 'YES' in that case. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'.
3. The program covers all possible scenarios and edge cases as described in the problem statement, ensuring that it behaves correctly for all inputs within the specified constraints.
