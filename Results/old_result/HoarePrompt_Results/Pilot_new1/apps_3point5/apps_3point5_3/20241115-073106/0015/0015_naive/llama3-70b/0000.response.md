Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. If c is equal to 0, the only way for b to appear in the sequence is if a is also equal to b. This case is correctly handled in the program.
2. If c is not equal to 0, b can appear in the sequence if (b - a) is divisible by c and the result is non-negative. This condition is correctly checked in the program.
3. The program covers all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement and provides the correct output for each case.
