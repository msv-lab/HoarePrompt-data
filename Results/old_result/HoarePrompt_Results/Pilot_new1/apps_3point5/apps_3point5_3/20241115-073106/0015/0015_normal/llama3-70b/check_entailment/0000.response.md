Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code correctly reads three integers `a`, `b`, and `c` from user input.
- If `c` is 0, the code checks if `a` is equal to `b` and prints 'YES', otherwise it prints 'NO', which is in line with the problem description.
- If `c` is not 0, the code checks if the condition `((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0)` is true, and prints 'YES' if it is, otherwise it prints 'NO'. This logic also aligns with the problem description.
- The code handles all the cases mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output for each case.
