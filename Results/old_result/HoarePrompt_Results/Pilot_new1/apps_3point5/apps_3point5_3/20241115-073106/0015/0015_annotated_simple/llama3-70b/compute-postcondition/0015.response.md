Functionality: **The function `func` reads three integers from the input and checks conditions based on the values of `a`, `b`, and `c`. If `c` is 0, it prints 'YES' if `a` is equal to `b` and 'NO' otherwise. If `c` is not 0, it verifies if ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, printing 'YES' if the conditions are met, and 'NO' otherwise. The code accurately handles scenarios where `c` is 0 and where the division result could be negative. The functionality is limited to input validation and conditional output based on the input values.**
