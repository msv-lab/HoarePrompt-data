Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers with specific values based on the input. `c` is not equal to 0. If ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed. If the condition is false, 'NO' is printed. The program handles all cases where the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by `c` and the result is non-negative, printing 'YES' in those instances. For all other cases, 'NO' is printed.***
