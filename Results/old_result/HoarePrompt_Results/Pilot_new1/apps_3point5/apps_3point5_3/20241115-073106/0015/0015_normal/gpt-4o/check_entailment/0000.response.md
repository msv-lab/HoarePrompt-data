Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the logic described in the problem statement. It checks if Vasya's favorite number `b` appears in the sequence `s` based on the conditions provided. If `b` is equal to the first element `a`, it prints 'YES'. If the difference between `b` and `a` is divisible by the difference between neighboring elements `c` and the result of the division is non-negative, it also prints 'YES'. Otherwise, it prints 'NO'. The code covers all the potential cases mentioned in the problem description and the provided examples, making it correct.
