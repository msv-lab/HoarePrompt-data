Postcondition: ***`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. If `b` is equal to `a`, 'YES' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a`, and `c` is equal to 0, then 'NO' is printed. If `b` is not equal to `a`, `c` is not equal to 0, and ((b - a) % c == 0 and (b - a) / c >= 0) is true, then 'YES' is printed. Otherwise, 'NO' is printed.***
