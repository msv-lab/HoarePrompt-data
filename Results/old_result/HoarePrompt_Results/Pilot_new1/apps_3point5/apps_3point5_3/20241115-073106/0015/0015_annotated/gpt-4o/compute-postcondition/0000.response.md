Example Answer:
`a`, `b`, and `c` are assigned values from the input after splitting. The values of `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9. Therefore, the Output State is: `a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9.
Output State: **`a`, `b`, and `c` are integers within the range -10^9 to 10^9**
