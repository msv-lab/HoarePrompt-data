According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than 26, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1 and `j` has been incremented based on the condition `s[i]` is equal to `target[j']`. To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of `s` after the increment and `j` needs to be less than 26 after the increment.
State: **`s` is a string containing small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of `s` after increment, `j` is less than 26 after increment**
