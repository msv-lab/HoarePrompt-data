Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the `res` string. The previous values of `res` and `char` are unknown. Therefore, the Output State is: If `s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string, then `s` is not empty. If `s` does not contain all characters in the `alphabet` string, then `res` contains the characters in the `alphabet` string that were replaced in `s`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last replaced character in `s`, and `res` now contains the added `char`.
Output State: **If `s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string, then `s` is not empty. If `s` does not contain all characters in the `alphabet` string, then `res` contains the characters in the `alphabet` string that were replaced in `s`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last replaced character in `s`, and `res` now contains the added `char`**
