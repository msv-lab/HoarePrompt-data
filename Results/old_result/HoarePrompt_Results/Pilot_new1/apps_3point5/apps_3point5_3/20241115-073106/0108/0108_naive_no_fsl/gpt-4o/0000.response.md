Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program takes the input string `s` and the target string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'.
2. It iterates through both strings to check if the characters match sequentially.
3. If the characters match, it increments the index for the target string.
4. If it successfully iterates through the entire target string, it prints the target string.
5. If not, it prints -1.
6. The program correctly follows the problem description and handles the case where it is impossible to obtain the target string.
