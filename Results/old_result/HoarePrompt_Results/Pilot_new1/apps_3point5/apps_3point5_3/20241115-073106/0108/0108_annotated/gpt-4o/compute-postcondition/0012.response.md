According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and `j`. If `i` is less than the length of `s` and `j` is less than 26, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `i` has been incremented by 1 and `j` is incremented by 1 if `s[i]` is equal to `target[j]`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a string containing small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is less than the length of `s` and has been incremented by 1, `j` is less than 26 and has been incremented based on the condition `s[i]` is equal to `target[j`]**
