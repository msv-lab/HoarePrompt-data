Correctness: **True**

The provided Python program correctly follows the problem description for every potential case. The program reads a string `s` and compares it character by character to the string 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `s` contains all the letters in 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz' in order, it prints 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz'. If `s` does not contain all the letters in order, it prints -1. The program covers all possible scenarios mentioned in the problem description and provides the correct output based on the input string `s`. The annotations also provide a clear explanation of the program's behavior after the loop and the if-else block, which aligns with the problem description. Therefore, the code is correct.
