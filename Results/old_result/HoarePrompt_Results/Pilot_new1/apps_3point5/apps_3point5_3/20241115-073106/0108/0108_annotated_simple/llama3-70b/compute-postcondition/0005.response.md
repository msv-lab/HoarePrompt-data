Example Answer:
The code replaces the first occurrence of the character `char` in the string `s` with the character that comes after `char` in the ASCII sequence. The value of `char` is incremented by 1 using `ord` and `chr` functions. The output state is: `s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence, `res` is the first lowercase English letter, `char` is the next lowercase English letter.
Output State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of `char` replaced by the next character in the ASCII sequence, `res` is the first lowercase English letter, `char` is the next lowercase English letter**
