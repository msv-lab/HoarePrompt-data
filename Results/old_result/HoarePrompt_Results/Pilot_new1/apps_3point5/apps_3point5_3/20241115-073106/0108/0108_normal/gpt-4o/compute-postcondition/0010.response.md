Postcondition: ***`s` is a string consisting of small English letters, `target` is 'abcdefghijklmnopqrstuvwxyz', `target_len` is 26, `i` is 1, `j` is an integer between 0 and 26 inclusive where the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the character at index `j` in `target` or `j` is less than 26. If the character at index `i` in `s` is equal to the character at index `j` in `target`, `j` is increased by 1. Otherwise, `j` remains unchanged.***
