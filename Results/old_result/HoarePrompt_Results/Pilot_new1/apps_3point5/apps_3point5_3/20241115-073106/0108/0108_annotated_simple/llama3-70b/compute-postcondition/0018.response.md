Example Answer:
`res` is updated by adding the value of `char` to it. The previous value of `res` is unknown, so the updated value of `res` depends on the value of `char`. The state of `s` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is updated based on the addition of `char`, `res` is updated based on the addition of `char`.
Output State: **`s` is updated based on the addition of `char`, `res` is updated based on the addition of `char**.
