Postcondition: ***If `s` contains all characters of `target` in order, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, `j` is equal to `target_len`, and the `target` string is printed. If `s` does not contain all characters of `target` in order, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, and `j` is less than `target_len`, then -1 is printed. If `s` is shorter than `target`, `i` is less than the length of `s`, and `j` is less than `target_len`, then -1 is printed. If `s` is longer than `target`, `i` is equal to the length of `s`, and `j` is less than `target_len`, then -1 is printed.***
