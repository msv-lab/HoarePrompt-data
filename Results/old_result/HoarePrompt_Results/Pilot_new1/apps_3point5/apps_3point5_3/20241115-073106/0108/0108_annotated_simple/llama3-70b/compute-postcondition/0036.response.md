According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `char` and the characters in `s`. If `char` is present in `s`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, if `char` is present in `s`, `res` is updated with the modified value of `char`, and `char` is updated to the next character in the ASCII sequence in `s`. If `char` is not present in `s`, the loop does not execute and the values remain unchanged. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `char` needs to be updated to the next character in the ASCII sequence in `s`.
State: **If `char` is present in `s`, `res` is updated with the modified value of `char`, `char` is the next character in the ASCII sequence in `s`**
