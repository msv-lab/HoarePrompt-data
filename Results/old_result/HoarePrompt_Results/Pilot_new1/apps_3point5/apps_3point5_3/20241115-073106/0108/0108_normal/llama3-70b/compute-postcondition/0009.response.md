According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `char` and `s`. If `char` is in `s`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string with the first occurrence of the character `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet, `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the replaced character in `s`. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, the next character in the alphabet after the current `char` in `s` must be present in `s`.
State: **`s` is a string with the first occurrence of the character `char` replaced with the next character in the alphabet, `alphabet` is assigned the string containing all small English letters, `res` contains the first character of the `alphabet` string followed by the next character in the alphabet after the replaced character in `s`, `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the replaced character in `s`**
