Output State: **If `s` contains all characters in the `alphabet` string, then `s` is not empty. If `s` does not contain all characters in the `alphabet` string, then `res` contains the characters in the `alphabet` string that were replaced in `s`, and `char` is the next character in the alphabet after the last replaced character in `s`, and `res` now contains the added `char`. If `char` is not in `s`, then `s` remains unchanged, `res` remains unchanged, and `char` remains the same.**
