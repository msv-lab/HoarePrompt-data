According to the code, the loop will execute for each character in the `alphabet` string. Since `alphabet` contains all small English letters, the loop will execute 26 times. Before the loop starts, `res` is an empty string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `alphabet` is assigned the string containing all small English letters, and `char` is the first character in the `alphabet` string.
State: **`s` is a string consisting of only small English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `alphabet` is assigned the string containing all small English letters, `res` is an empty string, `char` is the first character in the `alphabet` string**
