Output State: **If `char` is present in `s`, `s` is updated after replacing `char` with the next character in ASCII sequence; `res` is updated based on the addition of `char`. If `char` is not present in `s`, the loop doesn't execute and the values of `s` and `res` remain the same as the previous iteration.**
