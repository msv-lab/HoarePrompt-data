Example Answer:
`char` is added to the end of `res`, and `char` is the first lowercase English letter. Therefore, after execution, `res` will contain the first lowercase English letter. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`s` is a string consisting of lowercase English letters with a length between 1 and 10^5, `res` is the first lowercase English letter, `char` is the first lowercase English letter**
