Example Answer:
The character `char` is added to the end of the string `res`, which already contains the characters 'aa'. As `char` is 'a', after execution, `res` will be 'aaa'. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string with 'a' replaced by 'b' once and 'b' replaced back to 'a', `res` is a string containing the characters 'aaa', `char` is 'a'.
Output State: **`s` is a string with 'a' replaced by 'b' once and 'b' replaced back to 'a', `res` is a string containing the characters 'aaa', `char` is 'a'**
