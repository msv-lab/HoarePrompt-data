Output State: **If l is greater than r, the loop won't execute and total_sum remains 0. If the loop does execute, total_sum will contain the sum of all numbers that satisfy func_1(num, k) condition within the range [l, r] and will be modulo MOD. l, r, and num will be integers with num satisfying the condition of func_1(num, k) after each iteration.**
