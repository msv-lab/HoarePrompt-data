Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding the calculated value. The calculation involves `i` which is less than `k`, and `dp` does not contain the pair (n, k) with a value of 9. The updated value of `dp[n, k]` is modified based on the formula provided. 
Output State: **The value of dp[n, k] is updated with the calculated value**
