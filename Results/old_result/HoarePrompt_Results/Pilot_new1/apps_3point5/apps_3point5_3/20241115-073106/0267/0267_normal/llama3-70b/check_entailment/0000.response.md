Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines two functions `func_1` and `count` to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` such that each number contains at most `k` different digits.
- The `count` function correctly calculates the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits within a given range.
- The `func_1` function then uses the `count` function to calculate the sum of numbers from `l` to `r` meeting the specified criteria.
- The code handles the cases where `k` is 0, and correctly calculates the count of numbers with at most `k` different digits within the range.
- The code also applies the modulo operation as required by the problem description.
- The output hints provided for both functions align with the code logic and further validate the correctness of the code.
- Additionally, the code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, ensuring that it meets the specified requirements for all inputs.

Therefore, based on the code implementation, output hints, and alignment with the problem description, the correctness of the code is **True**.
