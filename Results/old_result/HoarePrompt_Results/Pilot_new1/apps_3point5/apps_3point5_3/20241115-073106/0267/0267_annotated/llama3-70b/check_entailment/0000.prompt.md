You have been assigned the role of a program verifier. Your task is to determine the correctness of a given Python program based on the provided problem description and  the annotations in the code. If the program is correct, that is it meets the requirements in the problem description, print Correctness: **True**; otherwise, print  Correctness: **False**. Partially correct programs should be considered incorrect. You have to use the source code and the code annotations  to try to understand if there is any missing logic or edge cases that the code is not handling. 
If the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case then it is incorrect.Since if for at least one input or potential case the program does not work then Correctness **False**.
You are trying to find any potential case that the porgram does not does what the problem descriptions says. The annotations in the code summarise the state of the program and  might give you examples of some of the cases that the code is not working corectly.
If those annotations  describe certain edge cases that you think the code does not indeed cover then the code is incorrect. If you can't think of an example of the ocde not working as expected then the code is correct.
You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**.

# Your task:
Problem description: You are given two integers $l$ and $r$ ($l \le r$). Your task is to calculate the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ (including $l$ and $r$) such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, and print this sum modulo $998244353$.

For example, if $k = 1$ then you have to calculate all numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number is formed using only one digit. For $l = 10, r = 50$ the answer is $11 + 22 + 33 + 44 = 110$.


-----Input-----

The only line of the input contains three integers $l$, $r$ and $k$ ($1 \le l \le r < 10^{18}, 1 \le k \le 10$) — the borders of the segment and the maximum number of different digits.


-----Output-----

Print one integer — the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ such that each number contains at most $k$ different digits, modulo $998244353$.


-----Examples-----
Input
10 50 2

Output
1230

Input
1 2345 10

Output
2750685

Input
101 154 2

Output
2189



-----Note-----

For the first example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{50 \cdot 51}{2} - \frac{9 \cdot 10}{2} = 1230$. This example also explained in the problem statement but for $k = 1$.

For the second example the answer is just the sum of numbers from $l$ to $r$ which equals to $\frac{2345 \cdot 2346}{2} = 2750685$.

For the third example the answer is $101 + 110 + 111 + 112 + 113 + 114 + 115 + 116 + 117 + 118 + 119 + 121 + 122 + 131 + 133 + 141 + 144 + 151 = 2189$.
Annotated Functions:
#Function 1:
def func_1(l, r, k):
    dp = {}
    return (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
    #The program returns the result of the expression (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function func_1 accepts three integers l, r, and k with specific constraints. It calculates the result of the expression (count(r, k, dp) - count(l - 1, k, dp)) % MOD and returns it. The function relies on the count function to perform the calculations. It does not provide detailed information on what the count function does or how it is implemented. The function does not handle any potential edge cases or missing functionalities specified in the annotations.

#Function 2:
def count(n, k, dp):
    if (k == 0) :
        return 0
        #The program returns 0
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, and dp is a dictionary that stores previously calculated values. If k equals 0, the program returns 0. In all other cases, the program continues to the next part of the code without any changes to the variables n, k, and dp.
    if ((n, k) in dp) :
        return dp[n, k]
        #The program returns the value stored in the dictionary dp at key (n, k)
    #State of the program after the if block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, and dp is a dictionary that stores previously calculated values. If (n, k) is present in dp, the program returns the value stored at that key. Otherwise, the program continues without modifying any variables.
    if (n < 10 ** k) :
        dp[n, k] = n
    else :
        dp[n, k] = 9
        for i in range(1, k):
            dp[n, k] += 9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))
            
        #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If k is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute. If k is greater than 1, then dp[n, k] is updated with a new value based on the given formula for each iteration of the loop, and i ranges from 1 to k-1.
        dp[n, k] += (10 ** (k - 1) - 10 ** (k - 2)) * (n // 10 ** (k - 1) - 1)
        dp[n, k] %= MOD
    #State of the program after the if-else block has been executed: *n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, and dp is a dictionary. If (n, k) is present in dp, the program returns the value stored at that key. If n is less than 10 to the power of k, dp[n, k] is assigned the value of n. If k is less than or equal to 1, the loop does not execute. If k is greater than 1, dp[n, k] is updated based on the given formula for each iteration of the loop, and i ranges from 1 to k-1. The final value of dp[n, k] is calculated by the formula involving n, k, and MOD.
    return dp[n, k]
    #The program returns the value stored at key (n, k) in the dictionary dp
#Overall this is what the function does:
The function `count` accepts three parameters: `n`, `k`, and `dp`. `n` is a non-negative integer, `k` is a positive integer, and `dp` is a dictionary that stores previously calculated values. 

The function first checks if `k` equals 0, in which case it returns 0. If the key (n, k) is present in the dictionary `dp`, it returns the value stored at that key. Otherwise, it calculates a new value for dp[n, k] based on the given formula involving `n`, `k`, and MOD. The final result is then returned.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `count` is to calculate and return values based on the conditions mentioned above.




I want you to try to see if the code (including all the functions) does what the problem description says. The code must follow the problem description for it to be correct!!
You can also use the code annotations to understand the code better. Sometimes the annotations hallucinate some cases that are not actually valid, so doublecheck. Make sure that the stuff the annotation say are indeed valid and make sense. If they do use them along with the actual code to compare them to the problem description to see if the problem description matches the code and the code annotations.
Does the code follow the problem description for every potential case?
If the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case then  then Correctness **False**. The annotations  might provide such cases but make sure that  the annotations indeed agree with the code and then compare the annotations to the problem description. Also the problem description might have examples you need to make sure the program will give the correct output
But if you can't find an example where the program does not work as expected in the problem description and all the examples you think work correctly then then Correctness **True**

You need to strictly follow the format Correctness: **True or False**. Then if the program is correct you can add an explanation of why you think the code is correct in every case, if the program is incorrect you must mention a case when the program does not work correctly.
