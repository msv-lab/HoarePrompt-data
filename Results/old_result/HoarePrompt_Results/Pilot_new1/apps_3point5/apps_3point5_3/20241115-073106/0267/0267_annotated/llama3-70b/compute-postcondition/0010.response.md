According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, n is a non-negative integer and k is a positive integer, so these values are already suitable for the loop to execute. However, the initial state needs to reflect that the loop is starting with i as 1.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp is a dictionary that stores previously calculated values where dp[n, k] is assigned the value 9, i is 1**
