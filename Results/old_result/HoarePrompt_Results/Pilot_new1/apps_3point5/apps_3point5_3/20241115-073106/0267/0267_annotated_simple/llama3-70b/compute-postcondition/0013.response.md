Example Answer:
The value of `dp[n, k]` is updated by adding `9 * 10 ** (i - 1) * (10 ** (k - i) - 10 ** (i - 1))`. The values of `n` and `k` remain unchanged. Since `i` is equal to `k`, the calculation simplifies to `9 * 10 ** (k - 1) * (10 ** 0 - 10 ** (k - 1))`, which further simplifies to `9 * 10 ** (k - 1) * (1 - 10 ** (k - 1))`. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp does not contain the pair (n, k) with a value of 9, i is equal to k, and the updated value of dp[n, k].
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp does not contain the pair (n, k) with a value of 9, i is equal to k, and the updated value of dp[n, k]**
