According to the code, the loop will execute as long as k is greater than 1. Before the loop starts, n is a non-negative integer and k is a positive integer, so these values are already suitable for the loop to execute. However, the value in the dictionary dp for the pair (n, k) is set to 9, which may not be relevant for the loop execution. Therefore, the state needs to be adjusted such that dp does not contain the pair (n, k) with a value of 9.
State: **n is a non-negative integer, k is a positive integer, dp does not contain the pair (n, k) with a value of 9**
