Example Answer:
The newly added divisor `x // i` is added to the set `divisors`. The previous values of `divisors` already contained all the divisors of `x`, including `i` and `x // i`. After adding `x // i`, the set `divisors` now includes all divisors of `x`, `i`, `x // i`, and the newly added `x // i`.
Output State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, and the newly added `x // i`**
