According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than `N`. At the end of the last iteration, `A` is a list of N integers, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of the previous value of `gcd` and the element at index `i` in list `A`, `i` is 2. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1. 
State: **`A` is a list of N integers, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of the previous value of `gcd` and the element at index 3 in list `A`, `i` is 3**
