Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x` and `i`, where `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`, and `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. Additionally, `divisors` includes `int(math.sqrt(x))` and `x // int(math.sqrt(x))`. If `x` is divisible by `i`, `divisors` is updated to include `i` and `x // i`.***
