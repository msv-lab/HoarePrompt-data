The function `func_2` accepts a parameter `x`. The parameter `x` is an integer such that 2 <= x <= 500. The function returns a sorted list of divisors of x in descending order, including 1 and x itself if x is greater than 1. If x is 1, the function returns an empty list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_2` is to accept an integer `x` and return a sorted list of its divisors in descending order, considering special cases when x is 1. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter x, returns a sorted list of divisors of x in descending order, including 1 and x itself if x is greater than 1. If x is 1, it returns an empty list.**
