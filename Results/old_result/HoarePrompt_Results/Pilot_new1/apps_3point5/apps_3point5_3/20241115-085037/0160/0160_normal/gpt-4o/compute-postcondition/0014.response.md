According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(math.sqrt(x))`. At the end of the last iteration, `divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, `int(math.sqrt(x))`, `x // int(math.sqrt(x))`, and `x // i`, where `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x`. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented by 1, and the set `divisors` needs to be updated to include the new `i` and `x // i`.

State: **`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including the updated `i` and `x // i`, `int(math.sqrt(x))`, `x // int(math.sqrt(x))`, and `x // i`, where `i` is a positive integer less than or equal to `x + 1`**
