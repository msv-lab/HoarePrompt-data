Postcondition: ***`A` is a list of N integers, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `gcd` is the gcd of all elements in list `A`, `i` is the current value of `i` + 1. If `i * i != gcd`, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i` if `gcd % i == 0`. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables `A`, `K`, `gcd`, `i`, and `max_divisor`. Ensure that the conditions stated in the precondition are maintained after the execution of the program fragment.***
