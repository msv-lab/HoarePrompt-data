According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `gcd`, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `A`, `max_divisor` are integers with adjustments based on the loop conditions. 

To determine the adjustments needed for the next iteration:
1. Check if the condition `i * i` is not equal to `gcd` holds true.
2. Update `max_divisor` based on the conditions mentioned in the description.

State: **`gcd`, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `A`, `max_divisor` are integers with adjustments based on the loop conditions. Adjustments are made based on the conditions mentioned above.**
