Example Answer:
`max_divisor` is assigned the maximum value between `max_divisor` and `i`. The value of `max_divisor` is updated based on this comparison. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `gcd` is recalculated based on the updated list `A`, `N` is greater than or equal to 2, `K` is an integer, `A_i` are integers, `A` is a list of integers obtained from input(), `max_divisor` is assigned the new value of `gcd` and the `gcd` is divisible by `i`.
