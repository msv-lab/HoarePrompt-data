Postcondition: ***`gcd`, `N`, `K`, `A_i`, `A`, `max_divisor` are integers with adjustments based on the loop conditions. If `gcd` modulo `i` equals 0, `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `i`. If `i` multiplied by `i` is not equal to `gcd`, then `max_divisor` is further updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd` divided by `i`.***
