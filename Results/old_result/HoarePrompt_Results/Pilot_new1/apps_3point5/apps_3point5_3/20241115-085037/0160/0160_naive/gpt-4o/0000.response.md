Correctness: **False**

The provided program is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the maximum possible positive integer that divides every element of A after the operations is 1. The program only considers divisors greater than 1, but the correct answer could be 1 in some cases. For example, if all elements of A are already divisible by 1, the program will not output the correct result.
