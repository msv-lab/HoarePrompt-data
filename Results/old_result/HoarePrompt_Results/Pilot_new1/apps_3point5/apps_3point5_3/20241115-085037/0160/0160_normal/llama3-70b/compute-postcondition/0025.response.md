Output State: **`A` is a list of N integers, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of all elements in list `A`, `i` is the current value of `i` + 1, and `max_divisor` is updated to the maximum value between the current `max_divisor` and `gcd // i` if `gcd % i == 0` and `i * i != gcd**
