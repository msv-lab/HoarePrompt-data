The function `func` reads two integers `N` and `K` from input, then reads a list of `N` integers `A`. It calculates the greatest common divisor (gcd) of all elements in list `A`. After that, it finds the maximum divisor of the gcd and prints it. If `N` is less than 2, the gcd remains the value of the first element of list `A`, and the maximum divisor is set to this gcd value. The function does not accept any parameters directly, and it operates based on the input constraints provided.
