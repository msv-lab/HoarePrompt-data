According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `gcd`. At the end of the last iteration, `A` is a list of N integers, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `gcd` is the gcd of all elements in list `A`, `i` is N if the loop executes, `max_divisor` is assigned the value of the maximum divisor of `gcd` that evenly divides `gcd`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
1. Update `i` to be the next value after the last iteration.
2. Update `max_divisor` based on the conditions mentioned in the loop.

State: *`A` is a list of N integers, `K` is a non-negative integer less than or equal to 10^9, `gcd` is assigned the value of the gcd of all elements in list `A` where `gcd` is greater than or equal to 1, `i` is N + 1, `max_divisor` is updated based on the conditions in the loop*
