Postcondition: ***`divisors` is a set containing all the divisors of `x`, including `i`, `x // i`, and the newly added `x // i`, where `x` is a positive integer greater than or equal to 1. The set `divisors` is updated with the divisors of `x` based on the condition `x % i == 0` in the if statement. The postcondition ensures that all possible divisors are correctly added to the set `divisors`, covering the edge cases of the divisors including `i`, `x // i`, and the newly added `x // i`.***
