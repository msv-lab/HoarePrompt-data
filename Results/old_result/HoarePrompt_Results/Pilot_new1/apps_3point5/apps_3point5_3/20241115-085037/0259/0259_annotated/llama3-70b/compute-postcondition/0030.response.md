Postcondition: ***`n`, `t`, `buses`, `s`, `d`, `min_time`, `ans`, `i`, `time` are as described. If the calculated time for the new tuple is less than the current minimum time, `min_time` is updated to the new minimum time, and `ans` is updated to the new value of i incremented by 1. In all cases, `i` is incremented by 1.***
