Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly reads the input values and stores them in the appropriate variables. It then iterates through the bus schedules to calculate the time each bus arrives after Serval goes to the station. It keeps track of the minimum time and the corresponding bus route index. Finally, it prints the bus route that Serval will use. The logic implemented in the program aligns with the problem description for all potential cases, as it correctly determines the bus route Serval will take based on the given inputs.
