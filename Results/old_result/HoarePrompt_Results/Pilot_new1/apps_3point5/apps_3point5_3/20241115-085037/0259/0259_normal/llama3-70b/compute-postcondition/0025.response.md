Postcondition: ***`min_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum time calculated, `ans` is an integer representing the index of the bus with the minimum time, `buses` is a list of buses with at least 2 elements. If `time` is less than `min_time`, then `min_time` is updated to the value of `time` and `ans` is updated to `i + 1`. The values of `i`, `(s, d)`, and `time` remain unchanged.***
