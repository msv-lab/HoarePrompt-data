Example Answer:
`map(int, input().split())` takes input, splits it, and converts the values to integers, assigning them to `s` and `d`. The initial state has `n` as a positive integer, `t` as a positive integer, and `buses` as an empty list. After executing the code, the output state is: `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is an empty list, `s` is an integer from input, `d` is an integer from input.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is an empty list, `s` is an integer from input, `d` is an integer from input**
