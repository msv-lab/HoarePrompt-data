Postcondition: ***`n` and `t` are positive integers, `bus_routes` is a list of tuples, `min_wait_time` is initialized to the minimum wait time, `chosen_route` is the index of the chosen route, `i` is 1, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned from the second tuple in `bus_routes. If (t - s_i) % d_i == 0, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This ensures that `wait_time` is correctly computed based on the conditions and values of the variables involved, covering all possible scenarios.***
