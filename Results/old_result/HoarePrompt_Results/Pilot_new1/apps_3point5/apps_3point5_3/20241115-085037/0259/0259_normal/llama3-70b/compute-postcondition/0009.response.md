Example Answer: 
`s` and `d` are assigned the values from the input after splitting it. The variables `s` and `d` will hold the values entered by the user. The list `buses` will have a new tuple `(s, d)` appended to it. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than the current value + 1, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list containing the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the current value + 1, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list containing the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`**
