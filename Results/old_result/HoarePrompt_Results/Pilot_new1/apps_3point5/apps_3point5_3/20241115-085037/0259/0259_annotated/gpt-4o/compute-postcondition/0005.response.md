Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is calculated as the difference between `s_i` and `t`. The initial state of `min_wait_time` being positive infinity, `chosen_route` being -1, `n` being at least 0, and `s_i` being greater than or equal to `t` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is at least 0, `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is at least 0, `s_i` is greater than or equal to `t`, and `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`**
