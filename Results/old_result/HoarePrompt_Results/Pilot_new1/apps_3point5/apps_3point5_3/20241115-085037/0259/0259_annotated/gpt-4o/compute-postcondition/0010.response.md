Example Answer:
The `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. Since the condition ((t - s_i) % d_i == 0) is false, the value of `wait_time` will be `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. The other variables remain unchanged. 
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is at least 0, and s_i is less than t, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`**
