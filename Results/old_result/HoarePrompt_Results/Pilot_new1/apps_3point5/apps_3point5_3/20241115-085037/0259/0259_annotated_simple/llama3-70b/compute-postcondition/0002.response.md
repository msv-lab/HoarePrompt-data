According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. Before the loop starts, the list `buses` is empty, and `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100. Since `buses` is empty, it does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `t` should be a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, and `_` (underscore) should be set to 0 at the start of the loop.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0**
