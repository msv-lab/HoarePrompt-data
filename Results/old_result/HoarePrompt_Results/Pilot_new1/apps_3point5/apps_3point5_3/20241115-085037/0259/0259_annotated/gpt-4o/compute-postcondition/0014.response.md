Example Answer: 
`min_wait_time` is assigned the value of `wait_time`, and `wait_time` is calculated based on the given conditions. Since the initial state of `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, the value of `wait_time` will be assigned to `min_wait_time`. Therefore, the Output State is: `min_wait_time` is the calculated wait time based on the conditions, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is at least 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is the calculated wait time based on the conditions, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is at least 0**
