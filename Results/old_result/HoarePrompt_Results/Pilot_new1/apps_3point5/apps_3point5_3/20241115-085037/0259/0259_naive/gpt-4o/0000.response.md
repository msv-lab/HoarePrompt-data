Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program takes the input values, calculates the waiting time for each bus route based on the time Serval goes to the station, and then chooses the bus route with the minimum waiting time. The logic in the program correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. The program iterates through each bus route, calculates the waiting time, and chooses the route with the minimum waiting time. The program outputs the correct bus route that Serval will use based on the given input.
