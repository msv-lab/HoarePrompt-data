Example Answer:
A new tuple `(s, d)` is appended to the `buses` list. The values of `s` and `d` are not specified, so the list `buses` will have an additional tuple at the end. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer greater than the current value + 1, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list containing the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the current value + 1, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list containing the newly appended tuple `(s, d)`**
