According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a positive integer. Therefore, to execute the loop one more time, you need to adjust `n` to be greater than the current value. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is a positive integer greater than the current value, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` is a list containing a tuple `(s, d)`, `s` is an integer from input, `d` is an integer from input**
