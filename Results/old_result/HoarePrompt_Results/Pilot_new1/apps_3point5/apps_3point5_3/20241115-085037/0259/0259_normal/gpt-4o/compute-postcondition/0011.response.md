Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` is less than `t`. If the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is the result of d_i minus the remainder of (t - s_i) divided by d_i.***
