Example Answer:
`chosen_route` is assigned the value -1. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: Precondition: n is a positive integer representing the number of bus routes. t is a positive integer representing the time Serval goes to the station. bus_routes is a list of tuples, where each tuple contains two positive integers s_i and d_i representing the time when the first bus of the route arrives and the interval between two buses of the route, respectively. min_wait_time is initialized to positive infinity. `chosen_route` is -1.
