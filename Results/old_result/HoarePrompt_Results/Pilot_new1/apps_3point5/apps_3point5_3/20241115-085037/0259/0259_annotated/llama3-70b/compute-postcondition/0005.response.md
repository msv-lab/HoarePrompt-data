According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `_` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `_` is 0 and `n` is greater than 0. To execute the loop one more time, `_` needs to be adjusted to 1.
State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer satisfying the constraints, `buses` contains one tuple, `_` is 1, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from splitting the input**
