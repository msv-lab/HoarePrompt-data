Example Answer:
`wait_time` is assigned the value 0. Since `wait_time` is the only affected variable, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is at least 0, and s_i is less than t. The difference between t and s_i is divisible by d_i, `wait_time` is 0.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is at least 0, and s_i is less than t. The difference between t and s_i is divisible by d_i, `wait_time` is 0**
