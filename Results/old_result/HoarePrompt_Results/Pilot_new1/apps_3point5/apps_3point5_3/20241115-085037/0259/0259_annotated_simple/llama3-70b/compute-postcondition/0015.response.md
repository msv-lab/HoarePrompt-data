According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the buses list. If the list has at least 1 bus schedule, the loop executes. At the end of the last iteration, `_` will be the index of the last bus in the list. So for the loop to be executed, the list must have at least 1 bus schedule, and `_` is the index of the last bus in the list. Also, `min_time` should be updated to reflect the minimum time value encountered during the loop iterations.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` representing the bus schedules with at least 1 schedule, `_` is the index of the last bus in the list, `min_time` is updated to reflect the minimum time value encountered during the loop iterations, `ans` is -1**
