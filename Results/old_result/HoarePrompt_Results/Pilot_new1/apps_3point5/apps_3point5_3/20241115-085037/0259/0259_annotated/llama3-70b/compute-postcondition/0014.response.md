Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` is a positive integer, `t` is a positive integer satisfying the constraints, `buses` contains `n` tuples, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from splitting the input. If `n` is 0, the loop does not execute and `buses` remains an empty list. `min_time` is initialized to positive infinity. `ans` is -1.**
