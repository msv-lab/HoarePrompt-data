Example Answer:
The variable `wait_time` is assigned the value of 0. Since the other variables are not affected by this assignment, the output state is:
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is positive infinity, `chosen_route` is -1, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` is less than `t`, the difference between `t` and `s_i` is divisible by `d_i`, and `wait_time` is 0**
