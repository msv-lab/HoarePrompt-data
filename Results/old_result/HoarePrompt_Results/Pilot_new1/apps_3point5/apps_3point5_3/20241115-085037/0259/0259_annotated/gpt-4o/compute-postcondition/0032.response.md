Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `n`, `s_i`, `d_i`, and `i` are all updated. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. In both cases, `s_i` is assigned the value of the first element of `bus_routes[i]`, `d_i` is assigned the value of the second element of `bus_routes[i]`, and `i` is less than the updated `n`.***
