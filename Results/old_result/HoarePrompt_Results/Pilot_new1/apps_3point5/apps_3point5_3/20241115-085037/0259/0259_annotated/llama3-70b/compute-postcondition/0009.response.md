Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned values by splitting the input and converting them to integers. The previous values of the affected variables are not provided, so the output state is: `n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains two tuples, `_` is 2, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from splitting the input.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 0, `t` is a positive integer, `buses` contains two tuples, `_` is 2, `s` and `d` are integers obtained from splitting the input**
