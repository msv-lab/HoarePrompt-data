Example Answer:
The values of `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned the values of `bus_routes[i]`. The variables `bus_routes` and `i` are not provided in the initial state, so their values are unknown. Therefore, the output state is: `min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all routes, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the route with the minimum wait time for the current iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values based on `bus_routes[i]`.
Output State: **`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all routes, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the route with the minimum wait time for the current iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values based on `bus_routes[i]**
