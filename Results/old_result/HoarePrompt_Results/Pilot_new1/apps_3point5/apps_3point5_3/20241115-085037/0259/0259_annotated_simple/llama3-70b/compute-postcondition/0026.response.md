According to the code, the loop will execute again if there are more buses to iterate over in the `buses` list. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` representing the bus schedules with at least 2 schedules, `_` is the index of the last bus in the list, `min_time` is updated to reflect the minimum time value encountered during the loop iterations, `ans` is updated to the value of `i + 1` where `i` is the index of the current bus, `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
1. `_` needs to be updated to reflect the index of the last bus in the list after the previous iteration.
2. `min_time` and `ans` need to be updated based on the conditions specified in the loop.
3. If there are more buses left to iterate over, the loop will execute again.

State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` representing the bus schedules with at least 2 schedules, `_` is the index of the last bus in the list after the previous iteration, `min_time` and `ans` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, and there are more buses left in the list to iterate over for the next iteration.**
