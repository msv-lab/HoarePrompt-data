Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains tuples `(s, d)` representing the bus schedules with at least 2 schedules, `_` is the index of the last bus in the list after the previous iteration, `min_time` is updated to the calculated value of `time`, and `ans` are updated based on the conditions specified in the loop, and there are more buses left in the list to iterate over for the next iteration, `time` is calculated as `(t - s) % d`**
