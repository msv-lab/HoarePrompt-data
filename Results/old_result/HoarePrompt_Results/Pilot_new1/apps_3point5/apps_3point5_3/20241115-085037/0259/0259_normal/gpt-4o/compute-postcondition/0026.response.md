Postcondition: ***`min_wait_time` is a positive integer representing the minimum wait time among all routes, `chosen_route` is an integer representing the route with the minimum wait time for the current iteration, `n` is greater than 0, `s_i` and `d_i` are assigned values based on `bus_routes[i]`. If `s_i >= t`, then `wait_time` is calculated as `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, then `wait_time` is 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. After the if statement executes, if `wait_time` is less than the current `min_wait_time`, `min_wait_time` is updated to `wait_time` and `chosen_route` is updated to `i + 1`. This update occurs for all possible variations of the initial conditions and calculations, ensuring that `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` are accurately maintained based on the comparison with `wait_time`.***
