Example Answer:
The `wait_time` variable is calculated based on the values of `t`, `s_i`, and `d_i`. The formula calculates the time left until the next bus arrives at the stop. The output state depends on the initial values of the variables provided, and the `wait_time` will be determined accordingly.
Output State: **Depends on the initial values of `n`, `t`, `bus_routes`, `min_wait_time`, `chosen_route`, `s_i`, and `d_i`, the `wait_time` will be calculated accordingly**
