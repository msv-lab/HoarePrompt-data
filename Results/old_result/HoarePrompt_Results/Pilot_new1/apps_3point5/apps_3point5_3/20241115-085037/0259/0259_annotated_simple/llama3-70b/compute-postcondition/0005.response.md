According to the code, the loop will execute `n` times based on the value of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is 0. In order for the loop to execute one more time, the value of `_` should be incremented by 1.
State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` contains a tuple `(s, d)`, `_` is 1**
