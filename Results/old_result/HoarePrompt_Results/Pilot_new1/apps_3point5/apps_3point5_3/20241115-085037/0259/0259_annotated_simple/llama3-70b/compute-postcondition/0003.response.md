Example Answer:
`s` and `d` are assigned values from the input after splitting it. Since the initial state does not mention the input values, the output state will be: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `s` is an integer, and `d` is an integer.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5, `buses` is an empty list, `_` is 0, `s` is an integer, and `d` is an integer**
