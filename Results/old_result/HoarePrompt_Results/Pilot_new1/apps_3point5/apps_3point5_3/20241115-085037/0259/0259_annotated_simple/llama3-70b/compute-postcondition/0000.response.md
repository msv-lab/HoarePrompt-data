Example Answer:
`n` and `t` are assigned the values from the input after splitting them. The values of `n` and `t` are positive integers within specified ranges. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5.
Output State: **`n` is a positive integer between 1 and 100, `t` is a positive integer between 1 and 10^5**
