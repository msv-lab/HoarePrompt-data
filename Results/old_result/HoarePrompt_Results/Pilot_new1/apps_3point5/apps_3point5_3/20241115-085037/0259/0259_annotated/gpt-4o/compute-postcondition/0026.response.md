Postcondition: ***After the execution of the if-else block, `min_wait_time` is updated to the minimum value between the previous `min_wait_time` and `wait_time`. `chosen_route` is updated to the corresponding route number `i + 1` based on the updated `min_wait_time`. The variables `n`, `s_i`, and `d_i` remain unchanged. If `s_i >= t`, `wait_time` is set to `s_i - t`. If `(t - s_i) % d_i == 0`, `wait_time` is set to 0. Otherwise, `wait_time` is calculated as `d_i - (t - s_i) % d_i`. This postcondition covers all possible scenarios and edge cases for the variables involved in the program fragment, ensuring the correct update of `min_wait_time` and `chosen_route` based on the calculated `wait_time`.***
