Example Answer: 
The variable `min_pos` is assigned the index of the first occurrence of the value 1 in the list `a`. The previous values of `a` are not provided, so it is unknown where the value 1 is located in the list. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values that are split, and `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values that are split, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`**
