Example Answer:
The variable `min_pos` is assigned the index of the element 1 in the list `a`. Since the list `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, the index of 1 in the list `a` would be 0. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0**
