Example Answer:
`dist4` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1 - min_pos`. The value of `n` is not provided in the initial state, so we cannot calculate `dist4` accurately. Therefore, the Output State is: `a` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values that are split, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`.
Output State: **`a` is a list of integers created by mapping the input values that are split, `min_pos` is the index of the first occurrence of 1 in list `a`, `dist3` is the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`**
