Example Answer: 
`dist3` is assigned the absolute difference between 0 and `min_pos`. Since `min_pos` is initialized as 0, the absolute difference between 0 and 0 is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is n-1, `dist2` is 0, `dist3` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` contains n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is n-1, `dist2` is 0, `dist3` is 0**
