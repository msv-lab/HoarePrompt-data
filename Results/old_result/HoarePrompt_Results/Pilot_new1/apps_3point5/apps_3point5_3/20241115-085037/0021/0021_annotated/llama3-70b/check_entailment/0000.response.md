Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It reads the size of the permutation and the permutation itself, finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n), calculates the maximum possible distance between them by considering the absolute difference between their positions, and prints the maximum distance after performing exactly one swap. The code logic aligns with the problem requirements and handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement and examples. The annotations provided also accurately describe the functionality of the code.
