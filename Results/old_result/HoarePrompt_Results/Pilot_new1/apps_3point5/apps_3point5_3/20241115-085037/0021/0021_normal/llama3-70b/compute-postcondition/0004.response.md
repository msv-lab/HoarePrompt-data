Example Answer: 
The variable `max_dist` is assigned the maximum value between the absolute difference of `pos1` and the index of the largest number in the list `a` minus 1, and `n` minus 2. Since the values of `n`, `a`, and `pos1` are provided in the initial state, the calculation can be performed. 
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers where each integer is between 1 and n inclusive, `pos1` is the index of 1 in the list `a`, `max_dist` is the calculated maximum distance value**
