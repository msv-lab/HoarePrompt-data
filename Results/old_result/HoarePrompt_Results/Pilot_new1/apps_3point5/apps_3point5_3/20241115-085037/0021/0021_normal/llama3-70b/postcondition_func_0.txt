The function `func` reads an integer `n` and a list of `n` distinct integers `a`. It then calculates the maximum distance between the positions of the elements 1 and `n` in the list, considering the elements in between. The function also computes the minimum distance between the positions of the elements 1 and `n`. Finally, it prints the maximum value between the maximum distance and `n - 1` minus the minimum distance. The function does not return any value. The code operates under the precondition that `n` is an integer where 2 <= n <= 100 and `a` is a list of `n` distinct integers in the range of 1 to `n` inclusive.
