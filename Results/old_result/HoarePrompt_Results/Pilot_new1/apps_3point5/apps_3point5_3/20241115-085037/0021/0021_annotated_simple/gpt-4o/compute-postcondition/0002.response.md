Example Answer:
`min_pos` is assigned the index of the element 1 in list `a`. Since the list `a` contains distinct integers from 1 to n, the index of element 1 in list `a` is 0. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0**
