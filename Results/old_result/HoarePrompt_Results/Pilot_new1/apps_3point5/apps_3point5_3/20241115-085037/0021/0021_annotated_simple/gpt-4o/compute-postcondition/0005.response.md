Example Answer:
`dist2` is assigned the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `max_pos`. The value of `n` is the input integer, `max_pos` is `n - 1`, and `n` is distinct integers from 1 to n. Therefore, `dist2` is the absolute difference between `n - 1` and `n - 1`, which simplifies to 0. Hence, the Output State is: `n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1, `dist2` is 0.
Output State: **`n` is an input integer, `a` is a list of n distinct integers from 1 to n, `min_pos` is 0, `max_pos` is n-1, `dist1` is the absolute difference between 0 and n-1, `dist2` is 0**
