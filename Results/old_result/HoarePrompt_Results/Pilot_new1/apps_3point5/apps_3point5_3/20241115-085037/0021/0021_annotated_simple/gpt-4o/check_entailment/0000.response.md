Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The program correctly reads the input which consists of the size of the permutation and the elements in the permutation.
2. It then finds the positions of the minimum element (1) and the maximum element (n) in the array.
3. It calculates the distance of the minimum element from the beginning and end of the array, as well as the distance of the maximum element from the beginning and end of the array.
4. Finally, it calculates the maximum possible distance between the minimum and maximum elements after a single swap and prints it.
5. The logic of finding the minimum and maximum elements and calculating the distances seems correct and in line with the problem description.
6. The program should work correctly for all potential cases as it follows the problem description accurately.
