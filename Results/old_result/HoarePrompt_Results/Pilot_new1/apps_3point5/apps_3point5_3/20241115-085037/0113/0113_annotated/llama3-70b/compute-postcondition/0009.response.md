Output State: **If n is divisible by 10^k then n remains the same. If n is not divisible by 10^k, the loop will execute until n becomes the smallest multiple of 10^k greater than the initial n. In this case, n will be that smallest multiple, k will remain the same, and x will be recalculated as 10^k with the same value of k.**
