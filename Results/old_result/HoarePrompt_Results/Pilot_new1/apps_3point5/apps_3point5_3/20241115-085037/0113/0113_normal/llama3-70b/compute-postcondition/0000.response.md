Example Answer:
`n` and `k` are assigned values using `map` and `split` functions. The values of `n` and `k` are positive integers satisfying the given constraints. Therefore, the Output State is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8**
