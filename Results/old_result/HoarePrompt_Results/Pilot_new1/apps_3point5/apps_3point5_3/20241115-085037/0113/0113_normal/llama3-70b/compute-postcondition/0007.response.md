According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `n`, `x`, and the result of the condition `n % x != 0`. If the condition is true, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is increased by 4, `k` remains the same, and `x` remains the same. To ensure the loop can execute one more time, `n` should be further increased to make `n % x != 0` true. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`n` is further increased by 4, `k` remains the same, `x` remains the same**
