Example Answer:
The value of `n` is increased by 1, but the initial state of `n` is that it is increased by 3. Therefore, after execution, the value of `n` is increased by a total of 4. The values of `k` and `x` remain the same.
Output State: **`n` is increased by 4, `k` remains the same, `x` remains the same**
