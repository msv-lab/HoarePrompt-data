Example Answer:
The value of `x` is calculated by multiplying `n` with the result of `(multiplier // math.gcd(n, multiplier))`. Since the values of `n` and `multiplier` are not specified, the output state is: n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000, and `x` is the result of the calculation.
Output State: **n and k are positive integers such that 1 ≤ n ≤ 10^9 and 0 ≤ k ≤ 8; `multiplier` is either 1, 10, 100, 1000, 10000, 100000, 1000000, 10000000, or 100000000, and `x` is the result of the calculation**
