The function `func` takes an integer input from the user and prints out the corresponding textual representation of that number. If the input is less than 10, it prints the textual representation from the `ones` list. If the input is between 10 and 19, it prints the textual representation from the `teens` list. If the input is 20 or greater, it prints the textual representation from the `tens` list followed by a hyphen and the textual representation from the `ones` list if the ones place is not zero. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.
