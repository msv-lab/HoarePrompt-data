Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 0 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places from 0 to 90. If 0 ≤ s ≤ 9, the function returns the string at index 's' in the list 'ones'. If 11 ≤ s ≤ 19, the function returns the string at index (s - 10) from the list 'teens'. If 10 ≤ s ≤ 99 and s is not between 11 and 19, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of `s` from the 'tens' list if `s` is divisible by 10. Otherwise, the function returns the concatenation of the string representation of the tens place of `s` from the 'tens' list with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place of `s`. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios within the specified ranges of `s`, ensuring the correct output based on the conditions of the program fragment.***
