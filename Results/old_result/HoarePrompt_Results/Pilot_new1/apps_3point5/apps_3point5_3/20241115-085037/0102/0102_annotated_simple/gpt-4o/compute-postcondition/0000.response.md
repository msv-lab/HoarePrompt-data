Example Answer: 
The list `ones` is assigned a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine. The previous values of variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine**
