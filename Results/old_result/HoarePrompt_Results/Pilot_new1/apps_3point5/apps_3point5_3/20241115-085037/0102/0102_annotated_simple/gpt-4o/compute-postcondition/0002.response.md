Example Answer:
The list `tens` is defined with string representations of numbers from zero to nine. The values in the list `tens` are unaffected by the current code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of string representations of numbers from eleven to nineteen.
Output State: **`n` is an integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 99, `ones` is a list of string representations of numbers from zero to nine, `teens` is a list of string representations of numbers from eleven to nineteen**
