Postcondition: ***`s` is an integer such that 10 ≤ s ≤ 99, `tens` is a list of strings representing tens places from 0 to 90. The value of `s` is not between 11 and 19, and `n` is an integer such that 10 ≤ n ≤ 99. If `n` is divisible by 10, the function returns the string representation of the tens place of `n` from the 'tens' list. Otherwise, the function returns the concatenation of the string representation of the tens place of `n` from the 'tens' list with a hyphen and the string representation of the ones place of `n`. The postcondition covers all possible cases for the input variables `s` and `n` in the specified ranges, ensuring the correct output based on the conditions of the program fragment.***
