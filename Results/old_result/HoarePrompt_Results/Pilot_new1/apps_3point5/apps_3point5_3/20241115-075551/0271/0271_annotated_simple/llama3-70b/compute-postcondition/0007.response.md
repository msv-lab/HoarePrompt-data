Example Answer:
The expression `n + (10 - n % 10)` adds 10 to the input integer `n` such that the last digit of `n` is larger than 5. Since the last digit of `n` is larger than 5, the result of the expression will be a multiple of 10. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that the last digit of n is larger than 5, and the result of the expression is a multiple of 10.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that the last digit of n is larger than 5, and the result of the expression is a multiple of 10**
