Example Answer:
The value of `n` is added to the difference between 10 and the remainder of `n` divided by 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer not divisible by 10 and the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is greater than 5, the result will always be the next multiple of 10 greater than `n`. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer that is not divisible by 10 and the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is greater than 5.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer that is not divisible by 10 and the remainder of `n` divided by 10 is greater than 5**
