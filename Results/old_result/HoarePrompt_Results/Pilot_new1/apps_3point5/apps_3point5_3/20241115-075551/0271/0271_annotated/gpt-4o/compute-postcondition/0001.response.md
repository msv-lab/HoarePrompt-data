Example Answer:
The variable `remainder` is assigned the value of `n` modulo 10. Since `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, the possible values for `remainder` can be between 0 and 9. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9**
