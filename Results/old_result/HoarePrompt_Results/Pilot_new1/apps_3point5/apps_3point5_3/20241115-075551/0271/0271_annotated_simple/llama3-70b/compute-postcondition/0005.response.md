Example Answer:
The code prints `n - n % 10`, where `n % 10` gives the last digit of `n`. Since the last digit of `n` is not 0 and is less than or equal to 5, subtracting the last digit from `n` gives a result. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer where the last digit of n is not 0 and less than or equal to 5.
Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer where the last digit of n is not 0 and less than or equal to 5**
