Example Answer:
`result` is assigned the value of `n - remainder`, where `n` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 10^9, and `remainder` is an integer between 0 and 9. Since the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the subtraction operation will result in a valid integer value. Therefore, the Output State is: n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is an integer between 0 and 9 (less than or equal to 5); result is the result of n - remainder.
Output State: **n is a non-negative integer such that 0 ≤ n ≤ 10^9, remainder is an integer between 0 and 9 (less than or equal to 5); result is the result of n - remainder**
