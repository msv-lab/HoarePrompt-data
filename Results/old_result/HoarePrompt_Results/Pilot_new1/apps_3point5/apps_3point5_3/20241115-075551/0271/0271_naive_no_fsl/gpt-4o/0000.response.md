Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly calculates the nearest integer that ends with zero by checking the remainder when dividing n by 10. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, it rounds down to the nearest multiple of 10. If the remainder is greater than 5, it rounds up to the next multiple of 10. The program covers all potential cases and provides the correct output as described in the problem statement.
