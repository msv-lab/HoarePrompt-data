Functionality: ** The function `func` reads an integer `n` from the user input. If `n` is divisible by 10, it prints `n`. If `n` is not divisible by 10, it removes the units digit and prints the resulting number if the units digit is less than or equal to 5. Otherwise, it increments `n` to the nearest multiple of 10 and prints the result. The function does not have any return value. **
