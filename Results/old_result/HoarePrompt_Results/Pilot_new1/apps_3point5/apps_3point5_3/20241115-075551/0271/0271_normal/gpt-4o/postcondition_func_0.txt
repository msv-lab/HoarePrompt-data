The function `func` reads an integer from the user input, calculates the remainder of dividing the input by 10, and based on the value of the remainder, it adjusts the result accordingly. If the remainder is less than or equal to 5, the result is the input number minus the remainder. If the remainder is greater than 5, the result is the input number plus the difference between 10 and the remainder. The function then prints the final result. The function does not accept any parameters and does not have a return value.
