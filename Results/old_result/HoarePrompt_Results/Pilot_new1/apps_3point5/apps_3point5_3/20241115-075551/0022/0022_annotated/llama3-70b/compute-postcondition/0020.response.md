Functionality: **The function `func` reads a string `s` from input, checks if `s` is a palindrome (reads the same forwards and backwards), and prints 'TAK' if it is a palindrome, and 'NIE' if it is not. The function assumes `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters. If the length of `s` is less than 2, the function does not execute the palindrome check.**
