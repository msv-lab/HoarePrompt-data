According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than `(n // 2)`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is `(n // 2) - 1`. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than `(n // 2) - 1`.
State: **`s` is a string of length between 1 and 1000, consisting of only English letters, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is `(n // 2) - 2`**
