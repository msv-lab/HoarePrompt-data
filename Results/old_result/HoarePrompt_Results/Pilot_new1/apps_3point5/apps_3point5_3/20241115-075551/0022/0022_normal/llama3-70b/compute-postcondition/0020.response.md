Functionality: **The function `func` reads an input string `s` from the user, calculates its length `n`, and checks if `s` is a palindrome by comparing characters from the start and end positions. If the characters do not match, `is_spalindrome` is set to False. The function then prints 'TAK' if `is_spalindrome` is True, indicating that the input string is a palindrome, otherwise it prints 'NIE'. The function works correctly for strings of length 2 or more, but it does not handle edge cases where the input string is empty or has a length of 1.**
