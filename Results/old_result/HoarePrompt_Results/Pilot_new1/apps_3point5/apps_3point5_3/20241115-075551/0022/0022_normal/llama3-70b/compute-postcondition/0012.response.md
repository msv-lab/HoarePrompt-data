According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than `n // 2`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a palindrome, so `is_spalindrome` is True. To execute one more time, the index `i` needs to be incremented by 1 to move to the next character pair in the string.
State: **`s` is the input string provided by the user with a length of at least 2, `n` is the length of `s`, `is_spalindrome` is True, `i` is incremented by 1**
