Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that checks if a given string `s` is an "s-palindrome" by iterating through the string and comparing characters from the beginning and end towards the middle. If any pair of characters does not match, the function returns False. Otherwise, it returns True. This logic aligns with the problem description of checking if a string is symmetric about the middle, making it an "s-palindrome". The function handles both odd and even-length strings correctly, ensuring that it accurately determines if the input string is an "s-palindrome" or not. Additionally, the code correctly prints "TAK" if the string is an "s-palindrome" and "NIE" otherwise. The code seems to cover all potential cases as described in the problem statement.
