Postcondition: ***`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is either True or False, `i` is 1. If `s[i]` is not equal to `s[n - i - 1]`, then `is_spalindrome` is set to False and the program breaks out of the loop. This covers the case where the string is not a palindrome at the i-th index.***
