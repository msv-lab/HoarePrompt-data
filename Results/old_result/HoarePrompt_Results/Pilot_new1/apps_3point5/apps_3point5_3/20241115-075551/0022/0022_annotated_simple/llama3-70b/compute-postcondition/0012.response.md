According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than half of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is either True or False, `i` is 1. To execute one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to 2.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `n` is at least 2, `is_spalindrome` is either True or False, `i` is 2**
