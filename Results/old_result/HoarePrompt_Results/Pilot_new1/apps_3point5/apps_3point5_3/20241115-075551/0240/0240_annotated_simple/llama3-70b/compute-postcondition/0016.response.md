The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `s` and `t`. The precondition is that `s` and `t` are strings containing only digits, and `t` can contain leading zeroes. After executing the function body, the program returns the integer value of 'n' after concatenating characters from 's' that are in 't_set' or remains unchanged. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two string parameters `s` and `t`, and return the integer value of 'n' after concatenating characters from 's' that are in 't_set' or remain unchanged.
