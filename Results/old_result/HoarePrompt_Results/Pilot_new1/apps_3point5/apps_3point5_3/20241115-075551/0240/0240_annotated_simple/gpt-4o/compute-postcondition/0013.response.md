According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the permutations of the characters in `chars`. If there are more permutations to generate, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the next permutation after the current `perm`, `candidate` is the string representing the next permutation of the characters in `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number based on the function `is_valid_number` with respect to `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`. 

So, for the loop to execute one more time, the next permutation `perm` should be generated and checked if it is a valid number. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is:
State: **`chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the next permutation after the current `perm`, `candidate` is the string representing the next permutation of the characters in `chars`. If `candidate` is a valid number based on the function `is_valid_number` with respect to `sub`, then the function yields `candidate`.**
