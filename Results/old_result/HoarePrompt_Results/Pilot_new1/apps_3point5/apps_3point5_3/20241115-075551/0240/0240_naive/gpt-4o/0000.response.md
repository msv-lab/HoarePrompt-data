Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program correctly takes the input string and the remembered substring. It then generates all possible permutations of the remaining characters in the input string after removing the remembered substring. It checks if the remembered substring is present in the generated numbers and the length of the number is correct. Finally, it finds the smallest number from the generated possible numbers and returns it as the output. The program follows the problem description for every potential case and provides the correct output.
