The `perm` variable is not defined in the given code snippet, so the code will result in a NameError. The variables `chars`, `sub`, and `candidate` will remain unchanged.
Output State: **`chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars`**
