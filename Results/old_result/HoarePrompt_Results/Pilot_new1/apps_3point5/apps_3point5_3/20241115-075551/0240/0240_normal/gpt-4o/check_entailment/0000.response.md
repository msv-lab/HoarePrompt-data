Correctness: **False**

Explanation: 
- The function `is_valid_number` has a missing variable `n_len`, which is not defined in the function or passed as a parameter. This will lead to a `NameError` when the function is executed.
- The function `generate_possible_numbers` generates permutations of characters in `chars` and forms a candidate number by joining them. It then checks if the candidate number is a valid number with respect to the substring `sub`. However, the function does not handle cases where the generated candidate number has leading zeroes, which is a requirement in the problem description. This means that the code does not follow the problem description for every potential case, as it may generate candidate numbers with leading zeroes, which is not allowed.
