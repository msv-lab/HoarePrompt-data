Output State: **`chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements. For each permutation `perm` of `chars`, the loop generates a `candidate` string by joining the characters in `perm`. If `candidate` passes the validity check with respect to `sub` in the function `is_valid_number(candidate, sub)`, then the function yields `candidate`. If there are no valid candidates, the loop does not yield anything.**
