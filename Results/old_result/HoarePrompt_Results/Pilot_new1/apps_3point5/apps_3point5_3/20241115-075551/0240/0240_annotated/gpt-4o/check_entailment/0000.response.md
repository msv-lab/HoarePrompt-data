Correctness: **False**

The code provided is incorrect because it does not handle the case where the substring `sub` contains leading zeroes. This is a potential case that the code does not cover, and it violates the problem description. The code should consider the possibility of leading zeroes in the substring `sub` when reconstructing the smallest possible initial integer `n`.
