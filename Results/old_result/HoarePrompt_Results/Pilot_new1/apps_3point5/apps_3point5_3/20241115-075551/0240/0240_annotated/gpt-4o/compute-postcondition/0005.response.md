According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the permutations of `chars`. If there are more permutations left, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is a permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`. To execute the loop one more time, the next permutation of `chars` needs to be considered. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is the next permutation of `chars` for `perm`.
State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`**
