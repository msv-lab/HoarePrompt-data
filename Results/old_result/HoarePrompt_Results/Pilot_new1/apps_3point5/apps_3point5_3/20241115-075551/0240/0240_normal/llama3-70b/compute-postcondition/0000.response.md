Example Answer:
The set `t_set` is created by converting the string `t` into a set. The set `t_set` will contain unique elements from the string `t`. The values of `s` and `t` are not affected by this operation.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`**
