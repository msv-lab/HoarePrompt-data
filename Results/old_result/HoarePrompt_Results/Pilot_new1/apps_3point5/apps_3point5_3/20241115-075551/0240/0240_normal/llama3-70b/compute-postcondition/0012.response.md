According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If `s` is not empty, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is either an empty string `''` or contains characters based on the conditions met by `c` in the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character `c` in `s` needs to be considered. If `c` is in the set `t_set`, then `n` will be appended with `c`. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted for the next iteration are `n` based on the value of `c`.

State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is either an empty string `''` or contains characters based on the conditions met by `c` in the next iteration**.
