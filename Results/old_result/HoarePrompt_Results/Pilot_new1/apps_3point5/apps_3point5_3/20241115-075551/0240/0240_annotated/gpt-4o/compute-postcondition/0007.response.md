Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the value of `candidate`, which is a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`. The variables `chars`, `sub`, and `perm` are not affected by the code snippet. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and the code snippet yields `candidate`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, and the code snippet yields `candidate`**
