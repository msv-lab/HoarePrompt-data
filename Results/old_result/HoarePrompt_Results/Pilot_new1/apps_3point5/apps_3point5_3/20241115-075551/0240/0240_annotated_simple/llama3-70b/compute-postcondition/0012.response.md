According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s` and the characters in the set `t_set`. If there are more characters in `s` to iterate over, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `t_set` is a set containing unique digit characters present in string `t`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the next character in the string `s`, `n` is the concatenation of the previous value of `n` and `c` if `c` is present in `t_set`.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time:
- If the loop is to execute one more time, `s` must still have more characters to iterate over.
- Since `c` is the next character in the string `s`, `c` should be the next character in `s`.
- If `c` is present in `t_set`, then `n` should be updated by concatenating `c`.
- Otherwise, `n` should remain unchanged.

State: **`t_set` is a set containing unique digit characters present in string `t`, `s` is a non-empty string with more characters to iterate over, `c` is the next character in the string `s`, `n` is the concatenation of the previous value of `n` and `c` if `c` is present in `t_set`**
