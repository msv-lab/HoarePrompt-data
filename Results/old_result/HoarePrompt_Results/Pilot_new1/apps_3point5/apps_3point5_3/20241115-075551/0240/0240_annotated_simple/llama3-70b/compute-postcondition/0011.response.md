Postcondition: ***`t_set` is a set containing unique digit characters present in string `t`, `s` is a non-empty string, `c` is the next character in the string `s`, `n` is the concatenation of the previous value of `n` and `c` if `c` is present in `t_set`. If `c` is in `t_set`, then `n` is updated by concatenating `c`. Otherwise, `n` remains unchanged.***
