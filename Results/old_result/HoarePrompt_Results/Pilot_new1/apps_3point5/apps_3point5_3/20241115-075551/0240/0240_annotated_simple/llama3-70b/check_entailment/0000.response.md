Correctness: True

Explanation: The provided function takes in a string `s` and a substring `t`, then iterates through each character in `s` and checks if it is present in the set `t_set` (which contains the characters of `t`). If the character is present, it is added to the result `n`. After iterating through all characters in `s`, the function appends the substring `t` to `n` and returns the integer value of `n`. This logic correctly follows the problem description of reconstructing the smallest possible initial integer `n` based on the given string and remembered substring. The function handles the case where `s` is empty or no characters are present in `t_set` by returning the original `n`.
