The function is_valid_number accepts two parameters: `num_str` and `sub`. It returns True if the substring `sub` is found in the string `num_str` and the length of `num_str` is equal to `n_len`, otherwise it returns False. However, there seems to be a missing variable `n_len` in the function, which could lead to a NameError when the function is executed. Additionally, the code does not define the variable `n_len`, so the actual behavior might differ from the annotation.
