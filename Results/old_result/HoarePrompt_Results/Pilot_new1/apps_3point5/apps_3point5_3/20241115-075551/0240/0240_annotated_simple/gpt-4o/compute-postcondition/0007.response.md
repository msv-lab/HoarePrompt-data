Example Answer:
The code snippet yields the `candidate` string representing the next permutation of the characters in `chars`. No variables are modified in this process. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of the characters in `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a collection of characters with at least 2 elements, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing the next permutation of the characters in `chars`**
