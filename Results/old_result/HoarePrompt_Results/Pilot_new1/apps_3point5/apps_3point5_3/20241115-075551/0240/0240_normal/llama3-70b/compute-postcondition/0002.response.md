According to the code, the loop will execute as long as there are characters in the string `s`. Since `s` is a string, it will have characters to iterate over. The loop will not depend on the variables `t`, `t_set`, or `n`. 
Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, and `n` is an empty string `''`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `t` is a string, `t_set` is a set containing unique elements from string `t`, `n` is an empty string `''`**
