According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `chars` and `sub`. If `chars` has at least 1 digit, the loop can execute. Since `sub` is mentioned as a substring of `n`, it implies that `sub` is a subset of `chars`. Therefore, for the loop to execute, `chars` should have at least 1 digit, `sub` should be a valid substring of `n`, and `perm` should represent a permutation of `chars`.
State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is a permutation of `chars`**
