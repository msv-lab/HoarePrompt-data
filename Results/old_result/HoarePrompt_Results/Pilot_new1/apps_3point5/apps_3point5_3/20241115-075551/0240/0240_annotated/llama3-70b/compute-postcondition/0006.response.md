According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there are characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a string of digits with length not exceeding 1,000,000, `t` is a substring of `s`, `t_set` is a set containing the characters of `t`, `n` is a string containing the first character of `s`, `c` is the first character in `s`, and if `c` is in `t_set`, `n` is updated to include `c`. 

For the loop to execute one more time, the next character in `s` needs to be processed. So the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `s` needs to be updated to remove the first character that has been processed.
- If the next character in `s` is in `t_set`, `n` needs to be updated to include this character.

State: **`s` is updated to remove the first character, if the next character in `s` is in `t_set`, `n` is updated to include this character**
