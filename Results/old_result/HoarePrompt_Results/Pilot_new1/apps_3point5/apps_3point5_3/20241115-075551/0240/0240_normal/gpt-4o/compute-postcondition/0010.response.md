Example Answer: 
The variable `candidate` is assigned the value of joining the next permutation of `chars`, which forms a valid number with `sub`. The specific values of `chars`, `sub`, and `candidate` are not provided, so the output state is: `chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, and `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars` that forms a valid number with `sub`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string containing at least one digit, `sub` is a substring of `n`, and `candidate` is the result of joining the next permutation of `chars` that forms a valid number with `sub**.
