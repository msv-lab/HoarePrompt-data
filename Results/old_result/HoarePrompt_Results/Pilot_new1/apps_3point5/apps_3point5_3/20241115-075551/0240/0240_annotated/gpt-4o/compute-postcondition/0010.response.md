Example Answer:
The value of `candidate` is assigned by joining the characters in `perm`. As `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` will be a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`. Therefore, the Output State is: `chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`.
Output State: **`chars` is a string representing a sequence of digits with at least 1 digit, `sub` is a string representing a substring of `n`, `perm` is the next permutation of `chars`, `candidate` is a string representing a permutation of the digits in `chars`**
