Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 0, `colors` is not empty, `color_counts` is a dictionary initialized with 0 counts for each color, `found` is False, `window_counts` is a dictionary. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts` now contains `color` with a count of 0. All other variables and dictionaries remain unchanged.***
