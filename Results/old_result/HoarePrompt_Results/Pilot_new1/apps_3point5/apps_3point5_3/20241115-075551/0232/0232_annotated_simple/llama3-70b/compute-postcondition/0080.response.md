Postcondition: ***colors is a list of integers with at least 1 color, counts is a list of integers, color_counts is a dictionary where each color in colors is a key with its count incremented by 1 or added with a count of 1 if not present, found is True if all counts in window_counts are equal to the corresponding targets in counts, and False otherwise, n is greater than 0, i is incremented by 1, j is less than n, color is the color at index j in the colors list, window_counts is a dictionary with color as a key and its count incremented by 1 if color was already present or added with a count of 1 if not present, n is greater than or equal to i, j is equal to i+2, color is the color at index j in the colors list, window_counts[color] is 2. If the condition in the if statement is met, found is set to True and the loop breaks. This ensures that the program has checked if all counts in window_counts match the corresponding targets in counts, indicating the presence of the desired colors in the window.***
