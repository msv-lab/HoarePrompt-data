Example Answer: 
The variable `left` is assigned the value 0. No other variables are affected by this assignment. Therefore, the Output State is: `desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys are colors of lightsabers and values are desired counts; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0.
Output State: **`desired_counts` is a dictionary where keys are colors of lightsabers and values are desired counts; `current_counts` is a defaultdict with default value 0, `left` is 0**
