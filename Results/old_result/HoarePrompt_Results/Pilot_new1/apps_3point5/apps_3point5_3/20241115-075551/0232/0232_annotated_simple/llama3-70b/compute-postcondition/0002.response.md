Example Answer:
The `counts` list is populated by converting the input values to integers using `map` and `int`, and then splitting the input based on spaces using `split()`. The previous state of `colors` is a list of integers, and after execution, `counts` will contain the input values as integers. Therefore, the Output State is: `colors` is a list of integers, `counts` is a list of integers based on the input values.
Output State: **`colors` is a list of integers, `counts` is a list of integers based on the input values**
