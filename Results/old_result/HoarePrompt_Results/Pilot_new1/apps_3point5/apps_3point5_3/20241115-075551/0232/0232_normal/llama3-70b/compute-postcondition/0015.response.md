Postcondition: ***`n` and `m` are positive integers such that 1 <= m <= n, `colors` still has more colors left to iterate over, `counts` is a list of integers obtained from input, `color_counts` dictionary is updated with the count of `color`. If `color` is not already in `color_counts`, it is added to the dictionary with a count of 0.***
