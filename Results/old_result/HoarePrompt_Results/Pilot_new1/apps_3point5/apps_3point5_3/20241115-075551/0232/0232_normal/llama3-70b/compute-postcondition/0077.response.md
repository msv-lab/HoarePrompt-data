Example Answer:
`window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1 for the color specified. The dictionary `color_counts` and `found` variable are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: n is greater than 0, colors is non-empty, color_counts is a dictionary with counts initialized to 0 for each color, window_counts[color] is either incremented by 1 or initialized to 0 if color was not in window_counts, found remains True if all counts in window_counts match the corresponding targets in counts after sorting, j is less than n.
Output State: **n is greater than 0, colors is non-empty, color_counts is a dictionary with counts initialized to 0 for each color, window_counts[color] is either incremented by 1 or initialized to 0 if color was not in window_counts, found remains True if all counts in window_counts match the corresponding targets in counts after sorting, j is less than n**
