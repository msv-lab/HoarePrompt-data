Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable indicating whether all color counts in `window_counts` match the corresponding target counts in the `counts` list. `n` is a positive integer, `i` is less than or equal to `n`, `j` is equal to the last index `n-1`, and `color` is the color at index `j` in the `colors` list. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is assigned the value 0. After the execution of the code snippet, the value of `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1 if `found` is True. If `i` is greater than or equal to `n`, the loop does not execute, and the initial state is maintained.***
