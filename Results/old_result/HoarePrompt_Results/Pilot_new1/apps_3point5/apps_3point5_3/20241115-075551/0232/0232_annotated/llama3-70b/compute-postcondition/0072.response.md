Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable. If all counts in the sorted values of `window_counts` match the corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop breaks. The variables `n`, `i`, `j`, `window_counts`, and `color` maintain their initial conditions. If the if condition is not met, then `found` remains unchanged, and the program continues without altering the other variables.***
