Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean. If all counts in `window_counts` are equal to their corresponding targets in `counts`, `found` is set to True and the loop is broken. In all cases, `colors`, `n`, `i`, `color`, and `j` retain their initial values, `j` is less than `n`, `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in the list `colors`. If `color` is not already present in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0, and the value in `window_counts` at index `color` is incremented by 1.***
