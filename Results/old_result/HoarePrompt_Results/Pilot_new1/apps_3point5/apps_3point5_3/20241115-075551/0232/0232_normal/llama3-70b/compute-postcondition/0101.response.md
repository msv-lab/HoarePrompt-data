Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean, `colors`, `n`, `i`, `color`, and `j` retain their initial values. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, the count of `color` in `window_counts` is reset to 0, `j` is increased by 1, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. Otherwise, no changes occur in the program variables.***
