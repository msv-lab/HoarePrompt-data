Output State: **`found` is True, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is less than `n`, `j` is equal to `i`, `window_counts` is a dictionary where `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1 if `color` is in the dictionary, and if `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is assigned 1. The counts of each color in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding target counts in `counts` after sorting and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.**
