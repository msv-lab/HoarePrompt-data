Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable that is set to True. `n` is a positive integer. `i` is incremented by 1. The values in the `window_counts` dictionary are all equal to their corresponding target values after sorting. For each `color` in `colors`, if `color` is not in `window_counts`, then `window_counts[color]` is set to 0.***
