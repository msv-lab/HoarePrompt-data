Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean, `colors`, `n`, `i`, `color`, and `j` retain their initial values. If `color` is not in `window_counts`, the count of `color` in `window_counts` is reset to 0, `j` is increased by 1, and `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`. Otherwise, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. If all counts of colors in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets, `found` is set to True and the loop is broken. This ensures that the program maintains the initial state of variables while checking for the target counts and updating the found flag accordingly.***
