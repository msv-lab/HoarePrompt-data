Output State: **`found` is True, `n` is a positive integer, `i` is incremented by 1, values in `window_counts` are all equal to their corresponding target values after sorting, `j` is less than `n+1`, `color` is assigned the value of `colors[j]`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement**
