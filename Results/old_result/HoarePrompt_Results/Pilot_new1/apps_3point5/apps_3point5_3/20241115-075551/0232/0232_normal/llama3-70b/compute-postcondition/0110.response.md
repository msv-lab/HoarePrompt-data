Example Answer:
The value in `window_counts` at index `color` is incremented by 1. The value of `color` is taken from the list `colors` at index `j`. Other variables retain their initial values. Therefore, the Output State is: `found` is a boolean, `colors`, `n`, `i`, `color`, and `j` retain their initial values, `j` is less than `n`, `color` is assigned the value at index `j` in the list `colors`. If `color` is not already present in `window_counts`, it is added with a value of 0, and the value in `window_counts` at index `color` is incremented by 1.
