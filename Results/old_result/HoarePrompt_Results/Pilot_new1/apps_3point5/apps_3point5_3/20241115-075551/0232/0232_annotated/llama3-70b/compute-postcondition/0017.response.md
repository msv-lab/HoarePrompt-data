At the end of the last iteration, `n` is the number of Jedi Knights, `m` is the number of possible colors of lightsabers, `colors` is a list of integers representing the colors of lightsabers of the Jedi Knights with at least 3 colors, `color_counts` is a dictionary. For the loop to execute one more time, there must be at least one more color in the `colors` list.
