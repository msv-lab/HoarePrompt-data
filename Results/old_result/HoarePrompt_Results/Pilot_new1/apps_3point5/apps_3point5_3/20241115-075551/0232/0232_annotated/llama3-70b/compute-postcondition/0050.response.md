Postcondition: ***`found` is a boolean variable that becomes True. `n` is a positive integer, `i` is an integer less than `n`, and `window_counts` is a dictionary where the value of `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1. The dictionary `window_counts` is initialized with keys not containing `color` set to 0. If `n` is less than or equal to `i`, the loop does not execute and `found` remains False.***
