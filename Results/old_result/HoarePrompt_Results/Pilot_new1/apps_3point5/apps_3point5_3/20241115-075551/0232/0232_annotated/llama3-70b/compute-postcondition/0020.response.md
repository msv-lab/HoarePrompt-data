According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If n is at least 1, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, found is False. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to `found` is False and `n` is greater than 0 and `i` is 0.
State: **`found` is False, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
