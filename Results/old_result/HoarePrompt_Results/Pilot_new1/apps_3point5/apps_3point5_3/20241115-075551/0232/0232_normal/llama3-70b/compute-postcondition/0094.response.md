Postcondition: ***`found` is False, `window_counts` match the targets in `counts` after sorting, `colors` is not empty, `n` is greater than `i`, `color` is equal to `colors[j]`, `j` is equal to `i`, `window_counts[color]` is incremented by 1, all counts in `window_counts` are equal to the corresponding targets in `counts`***
