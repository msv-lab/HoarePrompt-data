Example Answer:
`max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`, where `y` is the previous value of y and `z` is the previous value of z. The output state is: `x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x,y,z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`.
Output State: **`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x,y,z <= 100; `min_upvotes` is a non-negative integer between 0 and 100; `max_upvotes` is the sum of `x` and `z`; `min_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y`; `max_downvotes` is assigned the value of `y + z`**
