Postcondition: ***`x`, `y`, and `z` are non-negative integers such that 0 <= x, y, z <= 100. The values of `min_upvotes` and `max_upvotes` are assigned as x and x + z respectively. The values of `min_downvotes` and `max_downvotes` are assigned as y and y + z respectively. If max_upvotes is less than min_downvotes, the program will print '-'. If max_downvotes is less than min_upvotes, the program will print '+'. Otherwise, the program will print '?'. This covers all possible scenarios for the given variables and conditions, ensuring that all edge cases are handled appropriately.***
