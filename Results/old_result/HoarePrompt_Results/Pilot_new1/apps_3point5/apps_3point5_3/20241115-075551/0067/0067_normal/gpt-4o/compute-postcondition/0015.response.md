Functionality: **The function `func` reads three non-negative integers x, y, and z from the input. It then calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes based on these values. If the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, it prints '-'. If the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, it prints '+'. Otherwise, it prints '?'. The function covers all possible scenarios for the given variables and conditions, ensuring that all edge cases are handled appropriately. The function does not accept any parameters and does not return any value.**
