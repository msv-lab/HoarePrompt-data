Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code takes three integers x, y, and z as input representing the number of persons who would upvote, downvote, or are unknown. It then calculates the minimum and maximum upvotes and downvotes based on these values. If the maximum upvotes are less than the minimum downvotes, it prints '-'. If the maximum downvotes are less than the minimum upvotes, it prints '+'. Otherwise, it prints '?'. 

The code correctly handles all possible scenarios as described in the problem statement:
1. If there are more people upvoting than downvoting, it prints '+'.
2. If there are more people downvoting than upvoting, it prints '-'.
3. If the number of upvotes is equal to the number of downvotes, it prints '0'.
4. If there are multiple possibilities due to the unknown votes, it prints '?' to indicate uncertainty.

The output hints also agree with the code logic and the problem description, confirming that the code is correct for all potential cases.
