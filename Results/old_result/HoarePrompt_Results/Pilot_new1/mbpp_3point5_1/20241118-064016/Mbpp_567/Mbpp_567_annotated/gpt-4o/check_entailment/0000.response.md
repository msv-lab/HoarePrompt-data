Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It checks whether a specified list is sorted by iterating through the list and comparing each element with the next one. If an element is found that is greater than the next one, the function returns False, indicating that the list is not sorted. Otherwise, it returns True, indicating that the list is sorted. The annotations also confirm that the function behavior aligns with the problem description, emphasizing the need for at least 2 elements in the list to avoid index out of bounds errors. Since the code covers all potential cases as described in the problem, and the annotations support the correctness of the implementation, the code is deemed correct.
