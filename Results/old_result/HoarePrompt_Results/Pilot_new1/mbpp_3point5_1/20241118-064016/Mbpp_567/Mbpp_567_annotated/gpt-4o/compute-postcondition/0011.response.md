Output State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with at least 2 elements. If there exists an element at index `i` in `lst` that is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, the function returns False. Otherwise, the loop completes without any changes to the state of the program variables. Ensure that `lst` has at least 2 elements to avoid index out of bounds errors.**
