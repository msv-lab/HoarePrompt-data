Correctness: **True**

The code provided in the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not. It iterates through the list and compares each element with the next one to ensure that they are in non-decreasing order. If at any point an element is greater than the next element, it returns False. This aligns with the problem description which requires the function to return True if all elements are in non-decreasing order and False otherwise. The code and the annotations both agree on the functionality of the program. Since there are no cases provided where the program does not work as expected, we can conclude that the code is correct.
