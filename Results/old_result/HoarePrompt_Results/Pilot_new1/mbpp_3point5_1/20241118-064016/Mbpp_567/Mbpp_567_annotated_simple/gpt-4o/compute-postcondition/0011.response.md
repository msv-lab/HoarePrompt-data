Output State: **`lst` is a list with at least 2 elements. If any element at index `i` in `lst` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, the function returns False. Otherwise, there is no change to the list `lst`. If `lst` has less than 2 elements, the loop does not execute and the function does not return anything.**
