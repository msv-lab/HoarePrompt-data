Postcondition: ***`lst` is a list with at least 2 elements, `i` is an index less than the length of `lst` minus 2. If the element at index `i` in `lst` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, then the function returns False. In all other cases, the state of the program variables remains unchanged.***
