According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `i` is less than the length of `lst` minus 1. At the end of the last iteration, `lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2, and `i` is 0. To execute the loop one more time, the `i` needs to be incremented by 1.
State: **`lst` is a list of comparable elements with a length of at least 2, `i` is 1**
