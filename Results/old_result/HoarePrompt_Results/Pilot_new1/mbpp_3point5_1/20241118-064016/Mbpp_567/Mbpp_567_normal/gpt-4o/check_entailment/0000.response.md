Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided for the function `func_1` accurately follows the problem description. The function iterates through the input list `lst` and checks if each element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`. If any such comparison is found, the function returns False, indicating that the list is not sorted. If the loop completes without any such comparison, the function returns True, indicating that the list is sorted. The code also accounts for the case where the length of the list is 1 or less, in which case the loop does not execute and the function returns True. 

The output hints further confirm that the code aligns with the problem description. The hints explain that the function returns False if any element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, and returns True otherwise. They also mention that the loop does not execute if the length of the list is 1 or less, which is consistent with the code provided. 

Therefore, based on the code and the output hints, it can be concluded that the function `func_1` correctly checks whether a specified list is sorted or not for all potential cases.
