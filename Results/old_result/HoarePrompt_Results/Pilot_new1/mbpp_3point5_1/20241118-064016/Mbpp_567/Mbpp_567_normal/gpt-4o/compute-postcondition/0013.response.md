The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `lst`, which is a list of comparable elements. The list `lst` must have a length of at least 2 for the loop to execute. 

Case_1: During the loop, if any element at index `i` is greater than the element at index `i + 1`, the function returns False. If the loop completes without any such comparison, the function returns False. If the length of `lst` is 1 or less, the loop does not execute.

Case_2: If the loop does not execute (due to the length of `lst` being 1 or less), the function returns True.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` of comparable elements with a length of at least 2. It then checks if any element is greater than the next element in the list. If such a case is found, it returns False. Otherwise, if the length of the list is 1 or less, it returns True.
