Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it fails to correctly identify whether the specified list is sorted or not in all potential cases. For example, in the second assert statement `assert func_1([1, 2, 4, 6, 8, 10, 12, 14, 20, 17]) == False`, the list is not sorted as 17 is out of order, but the program incorrectly returns True. This shows that the program does not work as expected in all cases.
