According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and the length of `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 1, `j` is equal to `i + 1. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `i` needs to be less than the length of `nums` minus 2 and `j` should be `i + 2`.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements, `i` is less than the length of `nums` minus 2, `j` is equal to `i + 2**
