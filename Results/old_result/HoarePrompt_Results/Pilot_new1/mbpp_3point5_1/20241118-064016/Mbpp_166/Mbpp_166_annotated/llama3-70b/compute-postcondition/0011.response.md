Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If the XOR operation between elements at indices `i` and `j` results in an even number, `count` is increased by 1, and both `i` and `j` are incremented by 1. This process covers all possible cases of the XOR operation being even or odd, ensuring that `count` is updated accordingly while maintaining the integrity of the list `nums` and the indices `i` and `j`.***
