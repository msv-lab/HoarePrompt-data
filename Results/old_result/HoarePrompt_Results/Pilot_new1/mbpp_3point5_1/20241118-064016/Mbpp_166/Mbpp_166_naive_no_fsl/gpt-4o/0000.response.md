Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program correctly counts the number of pairs of integers in a list that xor to an even number. It first calculates the count of even and odd numbers in the list, then calculates the number of pairs for even and odd numbers separately, and finally returns the total count of pairs. The provided test cases also pass and the logic seems to be implemented correctly for all potential cases.
