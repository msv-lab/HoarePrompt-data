Example Answer:
The value of `count` is incremented by 1. The previous value of `count` is unknown, so the output state is: `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is less than the length of `nums` by 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums` by 1, `count` is increased by 1.
Output State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is less than the length of `nums` by 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums` by 1, `count` is increased by 1**
