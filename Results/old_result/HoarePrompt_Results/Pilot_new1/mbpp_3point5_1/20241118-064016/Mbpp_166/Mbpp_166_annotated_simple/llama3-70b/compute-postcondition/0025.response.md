According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is less than the length of `nums` by 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums` by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than the length of `nums` by 1. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is less than the length of `nums` by 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums`**
