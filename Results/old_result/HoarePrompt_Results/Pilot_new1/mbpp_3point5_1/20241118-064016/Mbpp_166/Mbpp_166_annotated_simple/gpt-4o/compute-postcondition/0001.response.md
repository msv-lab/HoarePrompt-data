Example Answer:
The variable `odd_count` is assigned the value of the length of the list `lst` minus the value of `even_count`. The initial state mentions that `even_count` is the count of even numbers in the list, so `odd_count` can be calculated as the difference between the total length of the list and the count of even numbers. Therefore, the Output State is: `lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in the list, `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in the list.
Output State: **`lst` is a list of integers, `even_count` is the count of even numbers in the list, `odd_count` is the count of odd numbers in the list**
