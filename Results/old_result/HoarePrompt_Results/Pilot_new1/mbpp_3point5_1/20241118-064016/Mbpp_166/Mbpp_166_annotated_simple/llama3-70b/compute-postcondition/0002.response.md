According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range of j is valid, which means i + 1 should be less than the length of nums. Before the loop starts, nums has at least 1 element ensures the loop can execute. The initial value of i is 0. Therefore, to adjust the state for the loop to execute, i needs to be 0, j needs to be i + 1, and count can remain 0.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `count` is 0, `i` is 0, `j` is 1**
