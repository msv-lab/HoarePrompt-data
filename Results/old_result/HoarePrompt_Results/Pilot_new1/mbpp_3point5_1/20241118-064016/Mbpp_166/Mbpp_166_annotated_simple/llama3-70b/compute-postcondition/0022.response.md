According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i` and the length of `nums`. If `i` is less than the length of `nums` by 1, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is less than the length of `nums` by 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums` by 1. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be less than the length of `nums`. Therefore, `j` should be less than the length of `nums` by 1. No other states need adjustment.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with at least 1 element, `i` is less than the length of `nums` by 1, `j` is less than the length of `nums` by 1**
