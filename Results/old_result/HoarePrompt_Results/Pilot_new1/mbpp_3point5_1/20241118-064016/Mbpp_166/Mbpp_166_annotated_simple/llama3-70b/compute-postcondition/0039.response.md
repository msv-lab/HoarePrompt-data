Output State: **If `nums` contains at least 2 elements and the XOR of any pair of elements results in an even number, `count` will be incremented for each such pair. If `nums` has less than 2 elements, or if the XOR of any pair of elements results in an odd number for all pairs, `count` remains unchanged.**
