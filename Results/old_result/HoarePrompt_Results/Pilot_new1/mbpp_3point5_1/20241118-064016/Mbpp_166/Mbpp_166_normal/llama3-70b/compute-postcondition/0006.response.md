According to the code, the loop can execute again if `j` is less than the length of `nums`. At the end of the last iteration, `nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 1. If the result of XOR between the elements at index `i` and `j` in `nums` is even, `count` is increased by 1. The values of `i` and `j` remain unchanged. So for the loop to be executed one more time, `j` should be less than the length of `nums` and the result of XOR between the elements at index `i` and `j` should be odd.
State: **`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, XOR result between elements at index `i` and `j` is odd, `count` may have been increased**
