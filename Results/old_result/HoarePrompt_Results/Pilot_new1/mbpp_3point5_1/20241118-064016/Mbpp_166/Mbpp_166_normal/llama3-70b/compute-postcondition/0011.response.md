Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with length greater than 1, `count` may have been increased based on XOR result, `j` is less than the length of `nums`. If the XOR result of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, `count` is incremented by 1. The postcondition covers all cases where the XOR result is even and accurately reflects the state of the program after the if statement executes.***
