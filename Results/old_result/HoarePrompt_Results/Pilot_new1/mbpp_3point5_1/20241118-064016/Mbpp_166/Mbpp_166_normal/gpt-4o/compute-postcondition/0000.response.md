Example Answer: 
`even_count` is assigned the sum of 1 for each element `x` in `lst` if `x` is even (divisible by 2). The initial state specifies that `lst` is a list of integers, so the program counts the number of even integers in the list. The output state is: **lst is a list of integers, even_count is the count of even integers in the list**.
Output State: **lst is a list of integers, even_count is the count of even integers in the list**
