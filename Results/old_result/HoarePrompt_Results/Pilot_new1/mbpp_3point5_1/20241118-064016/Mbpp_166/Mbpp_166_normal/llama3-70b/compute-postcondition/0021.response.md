Postcondition: ***`nums` is a list of integers with at least 2 elements. If the XOR result of `nums[i]` and `nums[j]` is even, `count` is incremented by 1. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios where `i` and `j` are adjusted to satisfy the XOR condition, ensuring that the `count` is updated accordingly.***
