The function accepts a dictionary of student information, a minimum height, and a minimum weight. It then filters the students based on the criteria that their height is greater than or equal to min_height and weight is greater than or equal to min_weight. The function returns a new dictionary containing only the students meeting these criteria, with each key being the student name and the value being a tuple of height and weight.
