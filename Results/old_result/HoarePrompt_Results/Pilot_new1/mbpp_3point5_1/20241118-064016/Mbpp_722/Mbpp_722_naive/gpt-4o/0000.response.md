Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program defines a function `func_1` that takes in a dictionary of student names as keys and tuples of float values representing height and weight as values, as well as minimum height and minimum weight. The function filters the students based on whether their height and weight are above the minimum values provided.

The program then uses a dictionary comprehension to iterate over the items in the student dictionary, checking if both the height and weight of each student are greater than or equal to the minimum height and minimum weight specified. If both conditions are met, the student is included in the filtered dictionary.

The program includes test cases to verify the correctness of the function for different scenarios, and all the test cases pass as expected. Therefore, the program is correct and meets the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
