The function `func_1` accepts three parameters: `student_data`, `min_height`, and `min_weight`. 

**Precondition**: `student_data` is a dictionary where each key is a student name and the corresponding value is a tuple of float (student_height, student_weight). `min_height` and `min_weight` are float values representing the minimum height and minimum weight respectively. 

After executing the function body, the program returns a dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, with each key being the student name and the corresponding value being a tuple of their height and weight.

Functionality: **The function accepts a dictionary `student_data`, minimum height `min_height`, and minimum weight `min_weight`. It returns a dictionary containing only the students whose height is greater than or equal to `min_height` and weight is greater than or equal to `min_weight`, with each key being the student name and the corresponding value being a tuple of their height and weight.**
