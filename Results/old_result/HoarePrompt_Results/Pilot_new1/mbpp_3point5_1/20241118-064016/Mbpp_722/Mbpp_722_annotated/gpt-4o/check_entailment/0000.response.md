Correctness: **True**

The code provided correctly implements the problem description. It takes in a dictionary of student information, a minimum height, and a minimum weight, and filters the dictionary to include only students whose height is greater than or equal to the minimum height and weight is greater than or equal to the minimum weight. The output is a new dictionary with the format {name: (height, weight)}. The annotations also align with the code and describe the same functionality. Since the code meets the requirements of the problem description and the annotations are consistent with the code, we can conclude that the code is correct.
