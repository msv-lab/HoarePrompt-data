Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program defines a function that takes in a dictionary of student names as keys and tuples of float values (student height, student weight) as values, along with minimum height and minimum weight. It then filters the students based on whether their height is greater than or equal to the minimum height and their weight is greater than or equal to the minimum weight.

The provided test cases cover the following scenarios:
1. Filtering students with height >= 6.0 and weight >= 70, which should only include 'Cierra Vega'.
2. Filtering students with height >= 5.9 and weight >= 67, which should include 'Cierra Vega' and 'Kierra Gentry'.
3. Filtering students with height >= 5.7 and weight >= 64, which should include all students in the input dictionary.

The program logic seems correct and handles the filtering based on the given conditions as described in the problem statement.
