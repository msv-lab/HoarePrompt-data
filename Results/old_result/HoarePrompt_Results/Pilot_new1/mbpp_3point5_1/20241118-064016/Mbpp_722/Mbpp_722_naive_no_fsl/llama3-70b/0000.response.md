Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function `func_1` correctly filters out students whose height and weight are above the minimum values specified. The program iterates through the student data dictionary and checks if both the height and weight of each student are greater than or equal to the minimum height and weight provided. If the conditions are met, the student is included in the filtered result. The logic of the function aligns with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
