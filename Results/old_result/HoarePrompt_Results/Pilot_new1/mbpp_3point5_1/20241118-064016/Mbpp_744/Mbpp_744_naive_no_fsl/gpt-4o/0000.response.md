Correctness: True

Explanation: The program correctly checks if the given tuple has any `None` value by iterating through the tuple and returning `True` as soon as it encounters a `None` value. If no `None` value is found, it returns `False`. The provided test cases cover both scenarios where the tuple contains a `None` value and where it does not, and the program gives the expected output for each case. Hence, the program is correct.
