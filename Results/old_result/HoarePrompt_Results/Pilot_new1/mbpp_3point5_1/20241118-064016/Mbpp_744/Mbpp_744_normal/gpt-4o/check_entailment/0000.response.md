Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided for the function `func_1` correctly follows the problem description. It iterates through the input tuple `tup` and checks if any element is `None`. If it finds a `None` value, it returns `True`, indicating that the tuple has at least one `None` value. If no `None` value is found, it returns `False`. The code covers all potential cases mentioned in the problem description, and the output hints also confirm the behavior of the code. Therefore, the code is correct.
