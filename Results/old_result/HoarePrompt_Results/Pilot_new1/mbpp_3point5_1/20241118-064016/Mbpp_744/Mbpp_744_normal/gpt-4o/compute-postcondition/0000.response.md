According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple `tup`. If the tuple has at least 1 item, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, `tup` is a tuple does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 item and `item` is the first item in the tuple.
State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 1 item, `item` is the first item in the tuple**
