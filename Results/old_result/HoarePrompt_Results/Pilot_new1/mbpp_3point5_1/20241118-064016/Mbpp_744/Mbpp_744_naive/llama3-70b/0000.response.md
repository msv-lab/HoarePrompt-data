Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly uses the `any` function along with a generator expression to check if any element in the input tuple is `None`. The logic is sound and covers all potential cases where a `None` value might be present in the tuple. Since there are no edge cases or scenarios where the program would not work as described, the program is correct.
