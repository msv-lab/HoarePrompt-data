The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple. The function first checks if the tuple `tup` has at least 1 item. If the item is None, the function returns True. If `tup` is an empty tuple, the loop does not execute, and no changes are made to any variables. Otherwise, there are no changes to `tup` or any other variables. 

If the tuple `tup` is not empty and does not contain None, the function returns False. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return True if it contains None, return False if it is not empty and does not contain None, and do nothing if it is an empty tuple.
