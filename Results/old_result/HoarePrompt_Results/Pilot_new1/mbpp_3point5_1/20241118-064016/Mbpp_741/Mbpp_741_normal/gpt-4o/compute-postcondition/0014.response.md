According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more characters left in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string where `char` is the third character. To execute one more time, the `char` needs to be the fourth character in the string `s`, and `first_char` is not equal to `char`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string where `char` is the fourth character, `char` is not equal to `first_char**`.
