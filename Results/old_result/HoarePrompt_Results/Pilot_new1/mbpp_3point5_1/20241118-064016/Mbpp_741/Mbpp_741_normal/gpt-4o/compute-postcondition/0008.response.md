According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `s` and `char`. If the loop is to execute one more time, `char` needs to move to the next character in the string `s`. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string where `char` is the first character. If `char` is not equal to `first_char`, then the function returns False. Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, `char` needs to move to the next character in the string `s`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string where `char` is the second character. If `char` is not equal to `first_char`, then the function returns False.**
