According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the string `s`. If the string has at least 1 character, the loop executes. Before the loop starts, the string `s` being a string does not ensure that the loop will execute, so it needs to be adjusted to `s` is a non-empty string and `char` is the first character in the string.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character in the string**
