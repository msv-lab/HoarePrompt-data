Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program defines a function `func_1` that checks whether all the characters in a given string are the same. The program first checks if the string is empty, in which case it returns True. Then, it initializes `first_char` with the first character of the string and iterates through each character in the string. If any character is not equal to `first_char`, the function returns False. Otherwise, if all characters are the same, it returns True.

The program covers all potential cases as per the problem description. It correctly handles the scenario where the string is empty, as well as the case where all characters are the same. The logic in the program is sound, and there are no edge cases identified where the program would not behave as expected. Hence, the correctness of the program is True.
