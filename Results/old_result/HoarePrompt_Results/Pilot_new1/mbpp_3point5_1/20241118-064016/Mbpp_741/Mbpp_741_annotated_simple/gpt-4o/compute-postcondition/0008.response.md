According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `s`. If `s` is a non-empty string, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `s` is a non-empty string, `char` is the first character in the string. So for the loop to be executed one more time, the `char` should not be equal to `first_char`.
State: **`s` is a non-empty string, `char` is not equal to `first_char**.
