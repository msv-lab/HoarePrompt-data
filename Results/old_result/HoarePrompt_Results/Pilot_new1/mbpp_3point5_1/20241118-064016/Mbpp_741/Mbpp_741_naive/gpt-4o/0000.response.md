Correctness: **True**

The given program defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and checks whether all the characters in the string are the same or not. It returns `True` if all characters are the same, and `False` otherwise. The program then includes assertions to test the function with different input strings.

The function iterates through each character in the string after checking if the string is empty. It compares each character with the first character in the string and returns `False` as soon as it finds a character that is different from the first character. If the loop completes without finding any differing characters, it returns `True`.

The assertions provided cover cases where all characters are the same (`'aaa'`), where all characters are different (`'python'`), and where some characters are the same and some are different (`'data'`). The function correctly returns `True` for the first case and `False` for the other two cases, as expected based on the problem description.

Therefore, the program is correct for all potential cases and the output of the function matches the problem description.
