Example Answer:
The volume of a cylinder is calculated using the formula: V = Ï€r^2h, where r is the radius and h is the height. The code calculates the volume based on the provided values of radius and height. The output state will be the same as the initial state, with the addition of the calculated volume.
Output State: **radius and height are non-negative numbers; volume is the calculated volume of the cylinder**
