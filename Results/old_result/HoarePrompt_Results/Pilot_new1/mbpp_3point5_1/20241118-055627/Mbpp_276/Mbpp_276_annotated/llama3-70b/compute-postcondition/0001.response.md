The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative numbers. After executing the function body, the program returns the volume of a cylinder with the given `radius` and `height`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and return the volume of a cylinder with those dimensions. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and returns the volume of a cylinder with the given dimensions.**
