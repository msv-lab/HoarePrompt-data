Example Answer:
The variable `volume` is assigned the value of `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`, where `radius` and `height` are non-negative numbers. The calculation involves squaring the `radius`, multiplying it by `height`, and then multiplying the result by `math.pi`. The output state is: radius and height are non-negative numbers, and volume is calculated based on the given formula.
Output State: **radius and height are non-negative numbers, volume is calculated based on the formula**
