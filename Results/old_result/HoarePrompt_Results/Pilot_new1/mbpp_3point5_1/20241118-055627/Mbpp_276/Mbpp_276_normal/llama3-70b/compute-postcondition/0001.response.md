The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, which are non-negative numbers. After executing the function body, the program returns the volume of a cylinder calculated using the formula `math.pi * radius`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, and return the volume of a cylinder based on the given radius. 
Functionality: **The function accepts non-negative numbers radius and height, and returns the volume of a cylinder calculated using the formula math.pi * radius.**
