Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` that calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `volume = math.pi * radius ** 2 * height` and returns the calculated volume as a non-negative number. The code correctly follows the problem description for all potential cases. The function takes in two non-negative numbers, radius and height, and calculates the volume of a cylinder using the provided values. The output hints also confirm that the function returns the calculated volume as expected. 
Therefore, the code is correct and meets the requirements specified in the problem description.
