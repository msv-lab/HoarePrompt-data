Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code seems to be correct based on the problem description. The function `func_1` accepts non-negative numbers `radius` and `height`, calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula `math.pi * radius^2 * height`, and returns the result. The code follows the problem description for all potential cases, as it correctly calculates the volume of a cylinder given the radius and height. The output hints also align with the code, confirming its correctness.
