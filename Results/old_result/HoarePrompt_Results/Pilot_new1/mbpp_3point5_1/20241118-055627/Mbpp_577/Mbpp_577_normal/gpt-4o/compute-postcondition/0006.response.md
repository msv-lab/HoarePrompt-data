Functionality: ** The function func_1 accepts a non-negative integer n. If n is greater than or equal to 5, it returns 0. Otherwise, it calculates the factorial of n and returns the last digit of the factorial. However, the code is missing a return statement for the case when n is less than 5 and the factorial is calculated. This missing functionality should be addressed in the summary. **
