Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly find the last digit of the factorial of a given number. The program only returns 0 if the input number is greater than or equal to 5, which is not in line with the problem description. The program should calculate the factorial of the given number and then return the last digit of the result. Since the program does not handle this logic for all potential cases, it is incorrect.
