Correctness: **False**

The given program does not correctly find the last digit in the factorial of a given number as per the problem description. The program simply returns 0 for all numbers greater than 4, which is incorrect. The correct approach to finding the last digit in the factorial of a given number is to calculate the factorial and then extract the last digit. 

For example, if we input n = 5, the factorial of 5 is 120, and the last digit is 0. However, the program returns 0 instead of the correct last digit 0. Hence, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
