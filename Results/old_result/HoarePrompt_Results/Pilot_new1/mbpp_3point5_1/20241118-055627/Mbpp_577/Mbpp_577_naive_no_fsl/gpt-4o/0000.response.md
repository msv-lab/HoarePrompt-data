Correctness: False

The program is incorrect because it does not find the last digit in the factorial of a given number as described in the problem. The program simply returns the last digit of the factorial of the number if it is less than 5, instead of calculating the last digit of the factorial for any given number. 

For example, if we test the program with func_1(21), the expected result should be 0 since the last digit of 21! is 0. However, the program will return 2 since it only checks if the number is greater than or equal to 5 and returns 0 without actually calculating the factorial.
