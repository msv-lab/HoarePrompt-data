Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` correctly checks whether the cost price is equal to the selling price, which indicates that there is no profit and no loss. The provided test cases cover all scenarios - where the cost price is not equal to the selling price (return False), where the cost price is equal to the selling price (return True), and another scenario where the cost price is not equal to the selling price (return False). Since the program passes all the provided test cases and covers all potential cases as per the problem description, the correctness is True.
