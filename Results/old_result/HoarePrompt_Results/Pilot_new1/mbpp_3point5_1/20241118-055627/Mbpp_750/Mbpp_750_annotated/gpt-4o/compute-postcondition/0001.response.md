The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst`, which is a list, and `tpl`, which is a tuple. The function returns a new list that is the concatenation of the elements of the list `lst` and the elements of the tuple `tpl`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and return a new list that contains the concatenation of the elements of both `lst` and `tpl`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that contains the concatenation of the elements of both `lst` and `tpl`.**
