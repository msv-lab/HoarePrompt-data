The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `lst` and `tup`. `lst` is a list and `tup` is a tuple. The function returns a new list that is the concatenation of the elements in the list `lst` and the elements in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and return a new list that contains the elements of both the list and the tuple concatenated together. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of the elements in `lst` and `tup`.**
