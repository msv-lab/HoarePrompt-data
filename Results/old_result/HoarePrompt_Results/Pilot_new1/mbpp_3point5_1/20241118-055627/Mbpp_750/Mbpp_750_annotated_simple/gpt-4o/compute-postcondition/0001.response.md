The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `lst` and `tpl`. The precondition is that `lst` is a list and `tpl` is a tuple. After executing the function body, the program returns the concatenation of list `lst` and the elements of tuple `tpl` converted to a list. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, then return a new list that contains the elements of both `lst` and `tpl` after converting the elements of `tpl` to a list.
Functionality: **The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, then returns a new list that contains the elements of both `lst` and `tpl` after converting the elements of `tpl` to a list.**
