The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `lst` and `tup`. The precondition is that `lst` is a list and `tup` is a tuple. After executing the function body, the program returns a new list that contains all elements from list `lst` followed by all elements from tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and return a new list that combines all elements from `lst` and `tup`.
Functionality: **The function accepts parameters lst (a list) and tup (a tuple), and returns a new list containing all elements from lst followed by all elements from tup.**
