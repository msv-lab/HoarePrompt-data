According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. If `n` is greater than `i * i`, the loop can execute. Before the loop starts, the state needs to be adjusted so that `n` is greater than `i * i`, and `j` is equal to `i * i`.
State: **`n` is greater than `i * i`, `i` is 2, `j` is equal to `i * i`, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to True, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are set to False, the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is True**
