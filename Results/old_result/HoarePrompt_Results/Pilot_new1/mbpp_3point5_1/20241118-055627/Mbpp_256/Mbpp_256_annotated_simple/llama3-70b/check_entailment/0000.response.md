Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
1. The `is_prime` function correctly determines if a number is prime or not by checking for divisibility from 2 to the square root of the number.
2. The `func_1` function correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number by iterating from 2 to n-1 and using the `is_prime` function to identify prime numbers.
3. The program handles the case when the input number is less than 2 by not executing the loop in `func_1`, which is appropriate as there are no prime numbers less than 2.
4. The program follows the problem description and logic provided in the annotations, ensuring that it calculates the correct number of prime numbers less than the input non-negative number.
