According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the range defined by `range(i * i, n, i)`. If the range is valid and not empty, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 4, `i` is the minimum value such that `i * i` is less than `n`, `is_prime` is as described, `j` is `i * i`, `is_prime[j]` is False. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to find the next valid value for `j` within the range `range(i * i, n, i)`. This means incrementing `j` by `i` until it reaches a value less than `n`. Additionally, the state of `is_prime[j]` needs to be updated based on the new value of `j`.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is the minimum value such that `i * i` is less than `n`, `is_prime` is as described, `j` is the next valid value within the range `range(i * i, n, i)`, `is_prime[j]` is updated based on the new value of `j`**
