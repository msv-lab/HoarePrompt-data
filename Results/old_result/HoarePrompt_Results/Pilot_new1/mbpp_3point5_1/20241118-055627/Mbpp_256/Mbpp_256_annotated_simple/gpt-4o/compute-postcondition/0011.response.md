According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n - i`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than `i * i`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n - i`, the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False. To execute the loop one more time, `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n - i` after incrementing by `i`. Therefore, the state that needs to be adjusted is `j`. 

State: **`n` is greater than `i * i`, `i` is 2, `j` is less than `n - i + i`, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with all elements initialized to True, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are set to False, the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is False, and `is_prime[j]` is False**
