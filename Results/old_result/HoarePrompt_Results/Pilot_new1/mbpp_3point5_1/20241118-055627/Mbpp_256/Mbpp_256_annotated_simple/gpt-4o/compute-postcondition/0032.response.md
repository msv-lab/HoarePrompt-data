Example Answer:
The value of `is_prime[j]` is updated to False. This means that the index `j` in the `is_prime` list is set to False. The other variables remain the same. Therefore, the Output State is: `n` is greater than 4, `i` is the minimum value such that `i * i` is less than `n`, `is_prime` is updated, `j` is the next valid value within the range `range(i * i, n, i)`.
Output State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is the minimum value such that `i * i` is less than `n`, `is_prime` is updated, `j` is the next valid value within the range `range(i * i, n, i)`**
