According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 3. Since `i` is less than the square root of `n`, the loop will execute one more time. The state of `is_prime` array needs to be updated based on the rules mentioned in the code snippet. In this case, we need to update the state of `is_prime` array for the next iteration based on the rules of setting multiples of `i` to False in the array.
State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with multiples of 2 and 3 set to False, except `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` which are False, and the elements at indices 3, 4, 6, 9 in `is_prime` are False.**
