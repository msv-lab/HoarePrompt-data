Functionality: The function `is_prime` accepts a non-negative integer `num` and determines if it is a prime number. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. If `num` is greater than or equal to 2, the function iterates through the range from 2 to the square root of `num` (inclusive). If `num` is divisible by any number in this range, the function returns False. If `num` is not divisible by any number, the function returns True. The function accurately checks for prime numbers based on the code logic and handles the edge case where `num` is less than 2.
