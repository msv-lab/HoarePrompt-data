Output State: **If n is less than or equal to 2, the loop does not execute. If n is greater than 2, the loop sets all multiples of i as False in the is_prime list. After the loop executes, n is greater than i * i, i is 2, j is less than n - i, is_prime is a list of length n with multiples of i set to False, except is_prime[0] and is_prime[1] which are False, and the element at index i in is_prime is False.**
