According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 4, `i` is 4, `is_prime` has specific elements set to False, and `j` is `i * i`. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` needs to be less than `n` which means `i * i` needs to be less than `n`. Therefore, `i` needs to be adjusted to a value where `i * i` is less than `n`.
State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is the minimum value such that `i * i` is less than `n`, `is_prime` is as described, `j` is `i * i`**
