According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`. At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2 and `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to True. 

To execute the loop one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to the next value after the previous iteration. Since the loop increments `i` by 1 in each iteration, the next value of `i` should be the current value plus 1.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to True, `i` is the next value after the previous iteration**
