According to the code, the loop can execute again if the next index after the current `j` satisfies the loop range conditions. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to True, `i` is a value that satisfies the loop range conditions, all values in `is_prime` except for `is_prime[j]` are unchanged and set to True, `j` is updated to the next index after the current `j` that satisfies the loop range conditions, `is_prime[j]` is set to False.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the next index after the current `j` needs to be determined based on the loop conditions. In this case, the loop range starts from `i * i` and increments by `i`. Therefore, the next index after the current `j` would be `j + i`. Additionally, the value of `is_prime[j]` should be set to True to indicate that the loop will execute at that index in the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to True, `i` is a value that satisfies the loop range conditions, all values in `is_prime` except for `is_prime[j]` are unchanged and set to True, `j` is updated to `j + i`, `is_prime[j]` is set to True**
