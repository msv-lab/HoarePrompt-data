According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. Since the loop is iterating over the range from `i * i` to `n` with a step of `i`, the loop will execute if `i * i < n`. 

To adjust the state for the loop to execute, `i` should be such that `i * i < n`. Additionally, `j` should be set to `i * i` at the start of the loop.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to True, `i` is the next value after the previous iteration, `j` is equal to `i * i`**
