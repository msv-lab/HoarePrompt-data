Output State: **The loop iterates through the multiples of `i` starting from `i*i` up to `n`, marking the corresponding indices in `is_prime` as False. If `i` is less than or equal to the square root of `n`, the loop will execute. If `i` is greater than the square root of `n`, the loop won't execute.**
