According to the code, the loop will execute as long as the range specified by `range(i * i, n, i)` is valid. The loop will execute again if there are more values within the range to iterate over. 

At the end of the previous iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to True, `i` is the next value after the previous iteration, and the value at index `j` in `is_prime` is set to False.

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following changes need to be made:
- `i` needs to be updated to the next value after the current `i`.
- The value at index `j` in `is_prime` needs to be set to False for the next iteration.

State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to True, `i` is the next value after the previous iteration, and the value at index `j` in `is_prime` is set to False**
