According to the code, the loop can execute again if the range `range(i * i, n, i)` is not empty. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to True, `i` is the next value after the previous iteration, and the value at index `j` in `is_prime` is set to False. So for the loop to execute one more time, the range `range(i * i, n, i)` must not be empty. This means that `i * i` should be less than `n`. 
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to True, `i` is the next value after the previous iteration, and the value at index `j` in `is_prime` is set to False, `i * i` is less than `n`**
