Output State: **After the loop executes, `n` remains a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. The `is_prime` list will have updated boolean values based on the multiples of `i` such that `i * i < n`. The loop will not execute if `i * i >= n`, in which case the state of variables remains the same as the initial state.**
