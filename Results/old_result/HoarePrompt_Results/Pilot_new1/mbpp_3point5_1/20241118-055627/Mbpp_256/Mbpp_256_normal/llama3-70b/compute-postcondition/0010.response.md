According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `i` is less than the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, and `i` is the next integer after `num`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` should be incremented by 1, and `num` should remain the same.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `i` is the next integer after `num + 1**
