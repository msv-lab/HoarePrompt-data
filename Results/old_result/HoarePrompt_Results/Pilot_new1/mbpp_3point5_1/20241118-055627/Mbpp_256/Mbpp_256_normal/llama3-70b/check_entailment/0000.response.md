First, let's analyze the code based on the problem description and the provided functions.

The problem description asks for a function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number.

Function number 1 (`func_1`) iterates from 2 to `n` and checks if each number is prime using the `is_prime` function. It increments a count for each prime number found and returns the total count.

Function number 2 (`is_prime`) checks if a number is prime by iterating from 2 up to the square root of the number and checking for divisibility. It returns True if the number is prime, and False otherwise.

Based on the code and the descriptions, the functions seem to be correctly implemented according to the problem description. The `func_1` function correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than `n`, and the `is_prime` function correctly determines if a number is prime.

Therefore, the correctness of the code is:

Correctness: **True**.
