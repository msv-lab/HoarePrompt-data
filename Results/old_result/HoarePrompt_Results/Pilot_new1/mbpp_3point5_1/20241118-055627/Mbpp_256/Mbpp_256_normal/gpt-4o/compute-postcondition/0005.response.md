According to the code, the loop will execute if `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2. Before the loop starts, `is_prime` needs to be adjusted so that `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` are set to True to ensure the loop executes.
State: **`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` with `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]` set to True**
