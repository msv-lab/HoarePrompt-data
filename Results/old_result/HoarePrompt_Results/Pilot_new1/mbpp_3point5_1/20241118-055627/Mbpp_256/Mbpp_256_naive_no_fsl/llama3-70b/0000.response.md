Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The program defines a function `is_prime` to check if a number is prime or not. It then iterates through numbers from 2 to n (excluding n) and counts the number of prime numbers. The logic of checking for prime numbers seems correct as it follows the standard approach of checking divisibility up to the square root of the number. The program handles the case of a non-negative number as required by the problem description. Additionally, the program correctly counts the prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. Overall, the code appears to be correct and meets the requirements of the problem description.
