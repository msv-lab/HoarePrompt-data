According to the code, the loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `i` is 3, `j` is 9. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be less than `n`, so `j` needs to be adjusted to be less than `n`. The next value of `j` should be calculated based on the current value of `i`. Since `i` is 3, the next value of `j` should be `i * i`, which is 9. Therefore, the states that need to be adjusted are:
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]`, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, `is_prime[j]` is False**
