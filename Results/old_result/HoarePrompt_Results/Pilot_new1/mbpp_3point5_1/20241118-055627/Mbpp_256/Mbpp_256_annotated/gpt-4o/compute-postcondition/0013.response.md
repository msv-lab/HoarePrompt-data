According to the code, the loop will execute again if `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1`, `i` is 2, the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is True, `i * i` is less than `n`, `is_prime[i]` is False, `j` is less than `n`, `is_prime[j]` is False. To execute the loop one more time, `j` should be less than `n` with the current conditions, so `j` needs to be adjusted to `j` is less than or equal to `n`.
State: **`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1`, `i` is 2, the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is True, `i * i` is less than `n`, `is_prime[i]` is False, `j` is less than or equal to `n`, `is_prime[j]` is False**
