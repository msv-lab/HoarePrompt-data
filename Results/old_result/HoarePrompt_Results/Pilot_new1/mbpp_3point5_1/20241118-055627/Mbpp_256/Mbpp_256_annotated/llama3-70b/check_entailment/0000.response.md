Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
Both functions `func_1` and `is_prime` are correctly implemented according to the problem description. 
- The `is_prime` function correctly determines whether a given number is prime or not.
- The `func_1` function correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than a given non-negative number `n`.

There are no edge cases or potential cases identified in the annotations that contradict the problem description. The code and annotations align with the requirements of the problem description, and all examples provided by the problem description are handled correctly. Hence, the correctness of the code is **True**.
