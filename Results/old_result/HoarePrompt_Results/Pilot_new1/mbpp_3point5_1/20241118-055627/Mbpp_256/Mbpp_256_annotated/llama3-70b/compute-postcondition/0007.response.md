According to the code, the loop can execute again if `i` is less than the square root of `num`. At the end of the last iteration, `num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4. To ensure the loop executes one more time, `i` needs to be adjusted to be less than or equal to the square root of `num`. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`num` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 4**
