Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]`, `i` is 4. If n is less than or equal to 16, no changes are made to the is_prime list. If n is greater than 16, the loop updates the values in the is_prime list to mark multiples of i as False. After the loop executes, is_prime will have updated values for multiples of i, and the other variables will remain unchanged.***
