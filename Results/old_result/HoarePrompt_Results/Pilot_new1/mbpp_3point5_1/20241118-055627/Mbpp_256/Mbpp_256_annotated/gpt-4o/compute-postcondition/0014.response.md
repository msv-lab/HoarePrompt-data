Output State: **The loop marks all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` as not prime in the `is_prime` list. If `n` is less than or equal to `i * i`, the loop does not execute. After the loop executes, `n` is greater than 2, `is_prime` is a list of boolean values of length `n` where all elements are True except for `is_prime[0]` and `is_prime[1]`, `i` is 2, and the element at index `i` in `is_prime` is False for all multiples of `i` less than `n`.**
