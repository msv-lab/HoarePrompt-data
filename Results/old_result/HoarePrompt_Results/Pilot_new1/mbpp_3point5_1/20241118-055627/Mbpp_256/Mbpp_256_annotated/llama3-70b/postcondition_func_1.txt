Functionality: The function `is_prime` accepts a non-negative integer `num` and determines if it is a prime number. If `num` is less than 2, the function returns False. For `num` greater than or equal to 2, the function checks if `num` is divisible by any number from 2 to the square root of `num` rounded up. If `num` is divisible by any of these numbers, the function returns False. If `num` is not divisible by any number in that range, the function returns True. The function accurately identifies prime numbers and non-prime numbers.
