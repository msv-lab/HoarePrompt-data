The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a character `ch`. The function then calculates the `first_index` as the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, and `last_index` as the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found. 

In Case 1, if `first_index` is -1 or `last_index` is -1 or `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, the function returns the string `s`. Otherwise, it does not modify any of the variables.

In Case 2, the function returns the string `s` with the character at `first_index` removed and the characters between `first_index` and `last_index` (both inclusive) removed. 

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s` and a character `ch`, then based on the occurrence of `ch` in `s`, it either returns the original string `s` or modifies it by removing specific characters.
