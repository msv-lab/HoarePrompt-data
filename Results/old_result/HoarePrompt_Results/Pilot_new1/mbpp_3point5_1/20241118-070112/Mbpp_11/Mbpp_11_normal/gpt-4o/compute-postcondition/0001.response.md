Example Answer:
`last_index` is assigned the value of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` using the `rfind` method. The value of `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a string, `ch` is a character, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found.
Output State: **`s` is a string, `ch` is a character, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found**
