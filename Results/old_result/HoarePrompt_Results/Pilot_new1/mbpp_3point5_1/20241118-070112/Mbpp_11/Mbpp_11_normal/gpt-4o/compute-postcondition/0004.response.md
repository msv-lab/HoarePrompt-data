Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `ch` is a character, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s` or -1 if `ch` is not found. If `first_index` is -1 or `last_index` is -1 or `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, the function returns the string `s`. Otherwise, the function does not modify any of the variables.***
