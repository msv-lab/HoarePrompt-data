Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a string `s` and a character `c`. It then finds the indices of the first and last occurrences of `c` in `s`. If both occurrences are found, it returns the string `s` with the characters at these indices removed. If either `c` is not found in `s`, the function returns the original string `s`.**
