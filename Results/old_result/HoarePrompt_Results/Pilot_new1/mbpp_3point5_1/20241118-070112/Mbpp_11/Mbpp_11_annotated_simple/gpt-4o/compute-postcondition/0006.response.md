The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a string `s` and a character `ch`. The function also has two integer variables `first_index` and `last_index`, which represent the index of the first and last occurrence of `ch` in `s`, respectively. 

In Case 1, if `first_index` is -1 or `last_index` is -1 or `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, the function returns the string `s` unchanged. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables `s`, `ch`, `first_index`, and `last_index`.

In Case 2, the function returns the string `s` with the character at `first_index` and `last_index` removed.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a string `s`, a character `ch`, and based on the values of `first_index` and `last_index`, either return the string `s` unchanged or return the string `s` with the characters at `first_index` and `last_index` removed.
