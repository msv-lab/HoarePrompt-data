Functionality: **The function func_1 accepts a string `s` and a character `ch`. It then finds the first and last occurrences of `ch` in `s`. If either of the indices is -1 or they are the same, the function returns the original string `s`. Otherwise, it returns `s` with the characters at the first and last indices of `ch` removed.**
