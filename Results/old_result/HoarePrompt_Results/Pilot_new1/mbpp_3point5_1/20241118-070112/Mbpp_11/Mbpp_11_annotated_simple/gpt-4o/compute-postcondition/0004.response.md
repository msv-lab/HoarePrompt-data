Postcondition: ***`s` is a string, `ch` is a character, `first_index` is the index of the first occurrence of `ch` in `s`, `last_index` is the index of the last occurrence of `ch` in `s`. If `first_index` is -1 or `last_index` is -1 or `first_index` is equal to `last_index`, the function returns the string `s`. Otherwise, there is no change in the variables `s`, `ch`, `first_index`, and `last_index`.***
