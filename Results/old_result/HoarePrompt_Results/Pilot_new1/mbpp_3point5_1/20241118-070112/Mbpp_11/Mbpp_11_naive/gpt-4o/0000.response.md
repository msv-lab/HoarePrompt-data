Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided Python function `func_1` correctly removes the first and last occurrence of a given character from the input string. The function uses the `find()` and `rfind()` methods to locate the first and last occurrences of the given character respectively. It then constructs the final string by excluding the characters at the first and last index of the given character. The function has been tested with multiple test cases and it produces the expected output for all of them. Therefore, it can be concluded that the program is correct.
