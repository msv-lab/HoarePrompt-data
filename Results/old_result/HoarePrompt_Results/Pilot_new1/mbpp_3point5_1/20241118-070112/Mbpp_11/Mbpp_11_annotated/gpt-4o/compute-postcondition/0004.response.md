Postcondition: ***s is a string, ch is a character, first_index is the index of the first occurrence of ch in s or -1 if ch is not found, last_index is the index of the last occurrence of ch in s. If first_index is -1 or last_index is -1 or first_index is equal to last_index, the function returns s. Otherwise, the function does not alter the values of s, ch, first_index, and last_index.***
