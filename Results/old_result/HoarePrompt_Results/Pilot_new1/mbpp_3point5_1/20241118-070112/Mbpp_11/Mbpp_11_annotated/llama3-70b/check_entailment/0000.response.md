Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description. The problem description states that the function should remove the first and last occurrence of a given character from the string. However, the code provided removes the characters at the first and last occurrences of the given character, but it does not remove the character itself. This means that the code does not fully meet the requirements of the problem description.

The annotations provided also confirm this discrepancy. The annotation states that the program returns the string `s` with the character at the index `first_occ` and `last_occ` removed, but it should actually remove the character itself.

Therefore, the code is incorrect as it does not completely adhere to the problem description.
