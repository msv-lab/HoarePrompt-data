The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements of any data type, and `element`, which can be any data type. 

Case_1: If the `element` is found in the list `arr`, the function returns True along with the index of the element in the list. If the `element` is not found in the list, the function does not return anything.

Case_2: If the `element` is not found in the list `arr`, the function returns False along with the index -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an element `element`, and if the `element` is found in the list, it returns True along with the index of the element. If the `element` is not found, it returns False along with the index -1.
