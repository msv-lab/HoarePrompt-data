Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` iterates through the elements of the input list `arr` and checks if the input element `elem` is equal to any element in the list. If the element is found, the function returns True along with the index of the element in the list. If the element is not found, the function returns False along with -1. This logic aligns with the problem description as it accurately identifies if the element is present in the list and provides the correct index if it is found. Additionally, the output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the function behaves as expected. Therefore, the code is correct.
