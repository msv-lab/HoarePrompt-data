The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `arr`, which is a list of elements, and `elem`, which is an element that can be compared for equality with the elements in `arr`. After executing the function body, if `elem` is found in `arr`, the function returns True and the index of `elem` in `arr`. If `elem` is not found in `arr`, the function returns False. If `arr` is an empty list, the loop doesn't execute, and the function returns False.

In the second case, the function returns False and -1. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of elements `arr` and an element `elem`, and return True with the index of `elem` in `arr` if `elem` is found in `arr`, False if `elem` is not found in `arr`, and False with -1 if `arr` is an empty list.
