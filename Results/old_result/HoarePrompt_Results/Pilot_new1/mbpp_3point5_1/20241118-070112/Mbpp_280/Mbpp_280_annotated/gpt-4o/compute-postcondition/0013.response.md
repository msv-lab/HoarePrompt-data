The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: a list `arr` and an element of any data type `element`. 

Case_1: If the `element` is present in the `arr` list, the function will return True along with the index of the element. If the `element` is not found in the list, the function will not return anything.

Case_2: If the `element` is not present in the `arr` list, the function will return False along with the index -1.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list `arr` and an element `element`, and if the `element` is present in the list, it returns True along with the index of the element. If the `element` is not found in the list, it returns False along with the index -1.
