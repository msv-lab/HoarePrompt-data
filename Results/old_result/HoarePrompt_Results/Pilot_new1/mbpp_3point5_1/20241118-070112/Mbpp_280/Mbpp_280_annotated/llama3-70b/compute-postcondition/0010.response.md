According to the code, the loop can execute again if there are more elements in the list `arr`. At the end of the last iteration, `arr` has at least 3 elements, `i` is 2, `x` is the third element in the list. For the loop to execute one more time, `arr` must have at least 4 elements, `i` should be 3, and `x` should be the fourth element in the list.
State: **`arr` is a list of elements with at least 4 elements, `i` is 3, `x` is the fourth element in the list**
