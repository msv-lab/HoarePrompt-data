According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop executes. At the start of the loop, arr is a list, so it needs to be adjusted to arr is a list with at least 1 element. Additionally, since the loop uses enumerate, the index should start at 0 and value should be the first element in the list.
State: **arr is a list with at least 1 element, index is 0, value is the first element in the list**
