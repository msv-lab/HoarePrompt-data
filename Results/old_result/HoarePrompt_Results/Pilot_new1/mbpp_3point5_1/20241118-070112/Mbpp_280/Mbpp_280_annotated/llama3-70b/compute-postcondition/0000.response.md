According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the arr list. If the list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the beginning of the loop, i is the index of the first element in the list and x is the first element in the list. So, for the loop to execute, the arr list must have at least 1 element, i is 0, and x is the first element in the list.
State: **arr is a list of elements with at least 1 element, i is 0, x is the first element in the list**
