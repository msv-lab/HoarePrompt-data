Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The provided Python program correctly implements the problem description. It rotates the binary string the given number of times and counts the number of times the integer value of the rotated binary string is odd. The logic of the program is sound, and it handles all potential cases as described in the problem statement. The program correctly updates the binary string after each rotation, converts it to an integer, and checks if the integer value is odd. The count is incremented accordingly. The final count is returned as the output. Since the program covers all potential cases and works as expected, the correctness is True.
