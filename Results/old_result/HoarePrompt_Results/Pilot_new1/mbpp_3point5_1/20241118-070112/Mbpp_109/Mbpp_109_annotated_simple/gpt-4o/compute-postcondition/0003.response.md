Example Answer:
The `binary_str` is converted to an integer using base 2. The value of `binary_str` is the rotated binary string. The other variables `num_rotations`, `count`, and `_` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: binary_str is the rotated binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, count is 0, _ is 0, integer_value is the integer value of binary_str.
Output State: **binary_str is the rotated binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, count is 0, _ is 0, integer_value is the integer value of binary_str**
