According to the code, the loop can execute as long as num_rotations is a non-negative integer. Before the loop starts, binary_str is a binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, and count is 0. To ensure the loop executes, the state needs to be adjusted to num_rotations is a non-negative integer, and _ is 0.
State: **binary_str is a binary string, num_rotations is a non-negative integer, count is 0, _ is 0**
