The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `binary_str`, which is a binary string, and `num_rotations`, which is a non-negative integer. After executing the function body, the program returns the number of times the rotated integer value is odd in the given rotated binary string. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`, and then return the count of odd integer values in the rotated binary string.
