According to the code, the loop will execute `num_rotations` times. At the end of the last iteration, `binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 3 if `integer_value` is even and 4 if `integer_value` is odd, `_` is in the range of `num_rotations + 1`, `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated `binary_str`. If `integer_value` is odd, `count` is increased by 1. 

To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, the following adjustments need to be made:
- `_` needs to be in the range of `num_rotations + 2`
- If `integer_value` is odd, `count` needs to be increased by 1

State: **`binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 3 if `integer_value` is even and 4 if `integer_value` is odd, `_` is in the range of `num_rotations + 2`, `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated `binary_str`. If `integer_value` is odd, `count` is increased by 1**
