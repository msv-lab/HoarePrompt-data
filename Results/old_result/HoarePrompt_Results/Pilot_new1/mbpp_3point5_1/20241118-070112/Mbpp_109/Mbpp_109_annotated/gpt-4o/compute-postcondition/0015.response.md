Output State: **`binary_str` is a rotated binary string, `num_rotations` is a non-negative integer, `count` is 4 if `integer_value` is even and 5 if `integer_value` is odd, `_` is in the range of `num_rotations + 2`, `integer_value` is the integer value of the rotated `binary_str`. If `integer_value` is odd, `count` is increased by 1, `integer_value` is the integer value of `binary_str`.**
