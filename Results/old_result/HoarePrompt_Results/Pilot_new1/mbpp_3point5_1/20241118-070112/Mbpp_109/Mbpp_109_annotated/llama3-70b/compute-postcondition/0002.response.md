According to the code, the loop can execute as long as `n` is greater than 0. Before the loop starts, `s` is a binary string repeated `n // len(s) + 1` times does not guarantee the loop execution. Therefore, the states need to be adjusted to `n` is greater than 0, `s` is a binary string, `count` is 0, and `i` is 0.
State: **`s` is a binary string, `count` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0**
