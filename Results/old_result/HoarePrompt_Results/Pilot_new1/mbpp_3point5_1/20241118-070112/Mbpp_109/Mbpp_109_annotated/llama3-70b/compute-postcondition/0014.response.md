The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `s`, which is a binary string, and `n`, which is a non-negative integer. The program returns the count of '1's in the binary string `s` modulo 2 if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or less, the program returns 0. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a binary string `s` and a non-negative integer `n`, and return the count of '1's in the binary string `s` modulo 2 if `n` is greater than 0. If `n` is 0 or less, it returns 0.
Functionality: **The function accepts a binary string s and a non-negative integer n. It returns the count of '1's in the binary string s modulo 2 if n is greater than 0. If n is 0 or less, it returns 0.**
