Example Answer:
`temp` is assigned a substring of `s` starting from index `i` and ending at index `i + len(s)`. The value of `i` is 0, and the length of `s` is greater than 0, so `temp` will be the entire string `s`. The other variables remain unchanged.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string, `count` is 0, `n` is greater than 0, `i` is 0, `temp` is the entire string `s`**
