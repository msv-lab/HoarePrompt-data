Correctness: True

Explanation: 
The program takes a binary string `s` and an integer `n` as input. It then rotates the binary string `n` times and counts the number of numbers with an odd value in each rotation. The program correctly handles the case when the binary string needs to be repeated multiple times to perform the rotations by using `s = s * (n // len(s) + 1)`. The program then iterates over each rotation, calculates the count of odd numbers, and returns the total count. The logic of counting odd numbers is also correct by using `temp.count('1') % 2`. Overall, the program follows the problem description and works correctly for all potential cases.
