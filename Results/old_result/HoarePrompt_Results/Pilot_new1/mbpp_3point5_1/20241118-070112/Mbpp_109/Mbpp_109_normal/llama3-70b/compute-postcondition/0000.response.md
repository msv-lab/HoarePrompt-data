Example Answer: 
The string `s` is repeated multiple times such that it is at least as long as the integer division of `n` by the length of `s` plus 1. Therefore, the length of `s` is increased by repeating it. The output state is: `s` is a binary string repeated to be at least as long as the integer division of `n` by the length of `s` plus 1, `n` is a non-negative integer.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string repeated to be at least as long as the integer division of `n` by the length of `s` plus 1, `n` is a non-negative integer**
