Example Answer:
The substring `temp` is extracted from `s` starting at index `i` and ending at index `i + len(s)`. The value of `i` is the current index + 1, so the substring `temp` will be extracted accordingly. The other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a binary string repeated to be at least as long as the integer division of `n` by the length of `s` plus 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is updated based on the count of '1's in `temp`, `i` is the current index + 1, `temp` is the substring extracted from `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string repeated to be at least as long as the integer division of `n` by the length of `s` plus 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is updated based on the count of '1's in `temp`, `i` is the current index + 1, `temp` is the substring extracted from `s`**
