Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
- The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a binary string `binary_str` and a non-negative integer `num_rotations`.
- It rotates the binary string `num_rotations` times by moving the last character to the front each time.
- Then, it calculates the decimal value of the final rotated binary string.
- If the decimal value is odd, it increments the count.
- Finally, it returns the count of odd decimal values after all rotations.

The code aligns with the problem description as it correctly rotates the binary string and counts the number of times the decimal value is odd. All the provided test cases pass, indicating that the function is working as expected for those cases. Additionally, there are no edge cases or potential scenarios identified where the code would fail to meet the requirements specified in the problem description.
