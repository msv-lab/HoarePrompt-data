Example Answer:
The count is updated by adding the count of '1's in `temp` modulo 2. The previous values of `count`, `temp`, and `n` are required to determine the exact count value. The output state will be dependent on the values of `count`, `temp`, and `n`.
Output State: **Dependent on the previous values of `count`, `temp`, and `n`**
