Example Answer:
The value of `temp` is extracted from `s` at index `i` to `i + len(s)`. Then, `count` is incremented by the count of '1's in `temp` modulo 2. The previous values of `count`, `i`, and `temp` are known. Therefore, the Output State is: `s` is a binary string repeated to be at least as long as the integer division of `n` by the length of `s` plus 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is updated based on the count of '1's in `temp`, `i` is the current index, `temp` is the substring extracted from `s`.
Output State: **`s` is a binary string repeated to be at least as long as the integer division of `n` by the length of `s` plus 1, `n` is a non-negative integer, `count` is updated based on the count of '1's in `temp`, `i` is the current index, `temp` is the substring extracted from `s`**
