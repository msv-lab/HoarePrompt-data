According to the code, the loop can execute as long as there is at least one sublist in the list_of_lists. Since max_length is 0, it does not affect the loop execution directly. Therefore, to adjust the states for the loop to execute, the list_of_lists must have at least one sublist. At the start of the loop, sublist should be the first sublist in the list_of_lists.
State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists with at least one sublist, sublist is the first sublist in list_of_lists, max_length is 0**
