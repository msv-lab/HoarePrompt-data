Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function correctly finds the length of the longest sublist in the given list of sublists. It uses a generator expression to iterate over each sublist in the list and calculates the length of each sublist. Finally, it returns the maximum length found, which corresponds to the length of the longest sublist. The logic is sound and there are no edge cases identified where the program would not work as expected.
