Postcondition: ***`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists. `sublist` is the next sublist in the list with its elements accessible. `max_length` holds the maximum length of any sublist encountered so far. If the length of `sublist` is greater than `max_length`, then `max_length` is updated to the length of `sublist`. All other sublists in `list_of_lists` have lengths less than or equal to the updated `max_length`.***
