Example Answer:
`max_length` is assigned the length of `sublist`. The value of `max_length` is updated based on the length of the current `sublist`. The other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the next sublist in the list with its elements accessible, `max_length` holds the maximum length of any sublist encountered so far.
Output State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `sublist` is the next sublist in the list with its elements accessible, `max_length` holds the maximum length of any sublist encountered so far**
