According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the list_of_lists. If there are more sublists in the list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, list_of_lists has at least 1 sublist, max_length is the length of the first sublist in the list, sublist is the first sublist in the list. To execute the loop one more time, the list_of_lists must have at least 2 sublists, and the sublist should be the second sublist in the list.
State: **`list_of_lists` is a list of lists with at least 2 sublists, `max_length` is the length of the first sublist in the list, `sublist` is the second sublist in the list**
