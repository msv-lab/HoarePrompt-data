Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct as it calculates and returns the length of the longest sublist in the list of lists 'lists', which aligns with the problem description. Additionally, the output hints also confirm that the function `func_1` is designed to find the length of the longest sublist in the input list of lists. Since there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description or output hints that the code might not handle, and the code aligns with the problem requirements, we can conclude that the code is correct.
