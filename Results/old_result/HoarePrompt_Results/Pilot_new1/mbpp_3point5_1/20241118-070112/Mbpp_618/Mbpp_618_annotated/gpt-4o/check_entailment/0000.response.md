Correctness: False

The code does not handle potential division by zero errors, as mentioned in the annotations. If any element in list2 is 0, the program will raise an exception. This does not align with the problem description, which requires the function to divide two lists element-wise without considering potential division by zero errors. Hence, the code is incorrect.
