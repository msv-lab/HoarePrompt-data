Example Answer:
The code raises a ValueError with the message 'Both lists must be of the same length' if the lengths of list1 and list2 are not equal. The lengths of list1 and list2 are not specified in the initial state, so the output state is: list1 and list2 are lists of numbers such that their lengths are not equal.
Output State: **list1 and list2 are lists of numbers such that their lengths are not equal**
