Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of numbers. The function then returns a new list containing the results of dividing each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. The division is performed element-wise. The function assumes that both input lists are of the same length, and all elements in `list2` are non-zero.**
