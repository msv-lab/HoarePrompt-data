Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes in two lists, `list1` and `list2`, and divides each element of `list1` by the corresponding element of `list2`. It first checks if the lengths of both lists are equal, and if not, it raises a `ValueError` as per the problem description. The code then proceeds to perform element-wise division using list comprehension and `zip` function, which aligns elements of two lists for iteration. This logic aligns with the problem description and ensures that the function correctly divides two lists element-wise. The output hints also confirm that the function performs the required division and handles the case where the lengths of `list1` and `list2` are not equal. Since the code meets the problem description for all potential cases and the output hints agree with the code logic, we can conclude that the code is correct.
