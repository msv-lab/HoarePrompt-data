Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided defines a function `func_1` which takes two lists `list1` and `list2` as input and returns a new list containing the results of dividing each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2`. The division is performed element-wise. The code uses list comprehension and the `zip` function to achieve this.

The code meets the problem description as it correctly divides each element in `list1` by the corresponding element in `list2` and returns the expected output for the given test cases. Additionally, the code assumes that both input lists are of the same length and all elements in `list2` are non-zero, which is in line with the problem description.

The output hints also agree with the code by stating that the function performs element-wise division and returns a new list with the results. Since the code aligns with the problem description and the output hints, we can conclude that the code is correct for all potential cases.
