Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code correctly implements the problem description by taking a list of lists, extracting the first and second elements from each sublist, and returning two lists containing these elements. The annotations also confirm that the program returns the first and second elements of the sublists as required by the problem description. There are no edge cases mentioned in the annotations that are not covered by the code, and the code logic aligns with the problem description. Hence, the code is correct for all potential cases.
