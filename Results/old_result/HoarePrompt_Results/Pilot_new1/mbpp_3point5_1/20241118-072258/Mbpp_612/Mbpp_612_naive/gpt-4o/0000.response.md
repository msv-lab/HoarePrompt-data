Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function `func_1` takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements, and correctly returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The function uses list comprehensions to extract the first and second elements of each sublist and then constructs the final list of lists as required. The provided test cases cover different types of input lists and the function passes all of them, indicating that it works correctly for all potential cases.
