Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The program takes a list of lists where each sublist has two elements and correctly returns a list of two lists where the first list contains the first element of each sublist and the second list contains the second element of each sublist. The program uses list comprehension to achieve this and there are no edge cases or scenarios where the program would not work as expected.
