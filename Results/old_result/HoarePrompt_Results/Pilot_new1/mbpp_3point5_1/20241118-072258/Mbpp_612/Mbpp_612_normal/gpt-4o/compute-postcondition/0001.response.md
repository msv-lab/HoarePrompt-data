Example Answer:
The code iterates through each sublist in list_of_lists and extracts the second element of each sublist, storing them in the second_elements list. Since the initial state contains the first elements of each sublist in first_elements, after running the code, the second_elements list will contain all the second elements of each sublist.
Output State: **list_of_lists is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements; first_elements is a list containing the first elements of each sublist in list_of_lists; second_elements is a list containing the second elements of each sublist in list_of_lists**
