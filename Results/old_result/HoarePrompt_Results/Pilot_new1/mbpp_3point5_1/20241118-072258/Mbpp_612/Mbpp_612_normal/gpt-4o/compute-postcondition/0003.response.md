The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `list_of_lists`, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. After executing the function body, the program returns two lists: one containing the first elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`, and another list containing the second elements of each sublist in `list_of_lists`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a list of lists `list_of_lists` and return two separate lists containing the first and second elements of each sublist. 
Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter list_of_lists, which is a list of lists where each sublist contains exactly two elements. It returns two lists: one containing the first elements of each sublist and another list containing the second elements of each sublist.**
