The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `tup`, which is a tuple, and `elem`, which is an element that can be present in the tuple. After executing the function body, the program returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and return the number of occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`.
Functionality: **The function accepts a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and returns the number of occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`.**
