Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided function takes in a tuple and an element, then correctly uses the `count` method of tuples in Python to count the occurrences of the given element in the tuple. This logic aligns with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected. Hence, the program is correct.
