Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The provided program defines a function that takes in a tuple and an element, then returns the number of occurrences of the element in the tuple using the built-in `count` method. This implementation directly aligns with the problem description, and there are no potential cases identified where the program would not work as expected. Therefore, the program is correct.
