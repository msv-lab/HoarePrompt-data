Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The given program correctly takes in a tuple and an element, then uses the count method of tuples to count the occurrences of the element in the tuple. The count method returns the number of times the specified element appears in the tuple, which is exactly what the problem description asks for. Since the program directly uses the count method, it covers all potential cases and works as expected for all inputs.
