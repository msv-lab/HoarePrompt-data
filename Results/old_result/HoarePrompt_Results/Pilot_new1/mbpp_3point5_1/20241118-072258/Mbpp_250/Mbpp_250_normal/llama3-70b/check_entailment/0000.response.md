Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in a tuple `tup` and an element `elem`, and then returns the count of occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. The code directly aligns with the problem description, which specifies that the function should return the number of occurrences of `elem` in the tuple `tup`. Additionally, the output hints confirm that the function `func_1` does exactly what is expected, which is counting the occurrences of the specified element in the tuple. Since the code meets the requirements of the problem description and the output hints agree with the code's functionality, we can conclude that the code is correct.
