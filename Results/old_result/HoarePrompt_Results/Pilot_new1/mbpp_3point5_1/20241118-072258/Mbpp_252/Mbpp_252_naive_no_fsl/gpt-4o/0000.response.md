Correctness: True

Explanation: The given program defines a function that converts a given complex number to polar coordinates using the cmath library. The function is then tested with three different inputs and the expected output is provided in the assertions. The function seems to be correctly implemented as it is using the cmath.polar() method which returns the magnitude and phase angle of the complex number. The provided test cases also seem to be straightforward conversions of real numbers to polar coordinates, which the function is able to handle correctly. Therefore, the program is correct.
