Correctness: **False**

The given program does not remove lowercase substrings from the input string as required by the problem description. Instead, it only retains the uppercase characters and discards the lowercase characters. This means that if the input string contains any lowercase characters, they will not be removed as specified in the problem description. 

For example, if the input string is "HelloWorld", the expected output should be "HW" after removing all lowercase substrings. However, the given program will output "HWo" because it retains the lowercase character 'o'. 

Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description and is incorrect.
