Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code seems to be correct and follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string. The code achieves this by using a list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string `s` and only keeping the characters that are uppercase using the `isupper()` method. The provided examples also match the expected output based on the problem description. Additionally, there are no edge cases mentioned in the problem description that the code does not handle. Therefore, the code is correct.
