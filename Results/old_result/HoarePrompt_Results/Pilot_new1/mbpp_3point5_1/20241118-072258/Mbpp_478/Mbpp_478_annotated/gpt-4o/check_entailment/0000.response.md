Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string `s` as input and returns a new string containing only the uppercase characters from the original string `s`. This matches the problem description perfectly. The code uses list comprehension to iterate over each character in the input string and only includes the characters that are uppercase. The annotations also confirm that the program returns a new string with only the uppercase characters. Since there are no cases provided where the program does not work as expected, and the code and annotations align with the problem description, the correctness is considered true.
