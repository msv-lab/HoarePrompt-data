Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided is a simple and straightforward implementation of finding the maximum of two numbers. The function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the maximum value between them. There are no edge cases or potential scenarios where this code would not work as expected. The output hints also agree with the code, confirming that the function does indeed follow the problem description for every potential case.
