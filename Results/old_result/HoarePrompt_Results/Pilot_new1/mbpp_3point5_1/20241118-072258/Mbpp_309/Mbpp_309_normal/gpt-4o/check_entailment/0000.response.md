Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the larger integer between them using a ternary operator. The code also includes assertions to test the function with different inputs. The function implementation aligns with the problem description, which is to find the maximum of two numbers. The function correctly returns the larger integer between `a` and `b` as expected. Additionally, the output hints given also support the correctness of the code by stating that the function accepts two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the larger integer between them. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, as well as the output hints, the code is correct for all potential cases.
