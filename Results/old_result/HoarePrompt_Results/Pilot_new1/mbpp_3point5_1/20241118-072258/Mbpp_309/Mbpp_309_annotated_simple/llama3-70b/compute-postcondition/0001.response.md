The function `func_1` accepts two parameters `a` and `b`, both of which are integers. The function then returns the maximum value between the two integers `a` and `b`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and return the maximum value between them. 
Functionality: **The function accepts two integer parameters a and b, and returns the maximum value between them.**
