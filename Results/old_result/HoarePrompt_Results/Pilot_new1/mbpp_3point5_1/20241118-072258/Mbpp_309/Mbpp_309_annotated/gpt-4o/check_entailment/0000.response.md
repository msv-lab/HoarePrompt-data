Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided defines a function `func_1` that takes in two integer parameters `a` and `b`, and returns the greater value between them. The code implementation is straightforward and aligns perfectly with the problem description. The annotation also confirms that the program returns the greater value between the two integers, which matches the problem description. Since there are no conflicting cases provided in the annotation or the problem description, and the code functions as expected, we can conclude that the code is correct.
