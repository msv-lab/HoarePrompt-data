The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists of any data type elements. It creates sets from `list1` and `list2`, finds the symmetric difference between the two sets, converts the result into a list, sorts the list based on the index of elements in the concatenation of `list1` and `list2`, and returns the sorted `result_list`.
