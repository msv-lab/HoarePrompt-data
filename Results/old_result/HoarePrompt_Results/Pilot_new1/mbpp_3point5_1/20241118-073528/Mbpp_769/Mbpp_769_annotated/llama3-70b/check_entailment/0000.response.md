Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code provided correctly implements the problem description by finding the symmetric difference between two lists and returning a sorted list of elements that are present in either list1 or list2, but not in both. The code utilizes set operations to achieve this and ensures the result is in sorted order. The annotations also confirm that the code behaves as expected by providing a summary of the program's functionality. Since there are no examples or indications in the annotations that suggest the code does not work as described, and the code itself aligns with the problem description, we can conclude that the code is correct.
