Example Answer: 
`set2` is assigned the set of elements in `list2`, which means `set2` now contains unique elements from `list2`. The state of `list1` remains unchanged, and `set1` contains unique elements from `list1`. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` is unchanged, `set1` contains unique elements from `list1`, `set2` contains unique elements from `list2`.
Output State: **`list1` is unchanged, `set1` contains unique elements from `list1`, `set2` contains unique elements from `list2`**
