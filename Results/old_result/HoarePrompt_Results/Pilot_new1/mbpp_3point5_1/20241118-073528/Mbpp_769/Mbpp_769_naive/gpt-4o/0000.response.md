Correctness: **False**

The given program is incorrect because it does not return the correct difference between two lists. The `symmetric_difference` method used in the program returns elements that are present in either of the sets but not in both. However, the problem description asks for the difference between two lists, which should include elements that are present in one list but not in the other.

For example, if we test the program with the inputs `[1, 2, 3]` and `[3, 4, 5]`, the expected output should be `[1, 2, 4, 5]`. However, the program will return `[1, 2, 4, 5]`, which is incorrect.
