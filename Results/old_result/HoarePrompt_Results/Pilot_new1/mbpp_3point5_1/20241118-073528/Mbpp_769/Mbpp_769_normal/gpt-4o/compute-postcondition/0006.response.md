The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists. After executing the function body, the program returns a new list containing elements that are unique to either `list1` or `list2`, sorted based on the index of elements in the concatenated `list1` and `list2`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept two lists `list1` and `list2`, and return a new list containing unique elements sorted based on their index in the concatenated lists.
