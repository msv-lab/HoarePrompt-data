Correctness: **False**

The code does not fully follow the problem description for every potential case. The output hints mention that the function should find the symmetric difference between the two sets created from `list1` and `list2`. However, the code uses the `symmetric_difference` method, which will return elements that are in either set, but not in both. This means that elements that are present in both sets will not be included in the result. Therefore, the code does not accurately calculate the difference between the two lists. 

For example, if `list1 = [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]` and `list2 = [6, 7, 1]`, the expected output should be `[2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7]` since all elements in both lists are different. However, the code will only return `[2, 3, 4, 5]` as it only considers elements that are not present in both lists.

Therefore, the code is incorrect based on the problem description.
