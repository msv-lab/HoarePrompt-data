Example Answer:
The set `diff_elements` is assigned the symmetric difference between `set1` and `set2`. The previous values of `set1` and `set2` are sets created from `list1` and `list2` respectively. The symmetric difference operation returns elements that are present in only one of the sets, so `diff_elements` will contain elements that are unique to either `set1` or `set2`. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from `list1`, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are unique to either `set1` or `set2`.
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from `list1`, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing elements that are unique to either `set1` or `set2`**
