Example Answer:
The `result_list` is assigned the list of elements in `diff_elements`, which contains elements unique to either `set1` or `set2`. The previous values of the affected variables are `list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from `list1`, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, and `diff_elements` is a set containing unique elements. After execution, `result_list` will contain the elements in `diff_elements` as a list.
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from `list1`, `set2` is a set created from `list2`, `diff_elements` is a set containing unique elements, `result_list` is a list containing elements unique to either `set1` or `set2`**
