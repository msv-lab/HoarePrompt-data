Example Answer:
A set `set1` is created from the elements of `list1`. The values of `list1` and `list2` are not changed. Therefore, the Output State is: `list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from `list1`.
Output State: **`list1` and `list2` are lists, `set1` is a set created from `list1`**
