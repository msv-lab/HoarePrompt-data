The function `func_1` accepts two parameters, `list1` and `list2`, which are lists. It creates two sets from `list1` and `list2`, finds the symmetric difference between the two sets, converts the result into a list, and sorts the list based on the index of elements in the concatenated `list1` and `list2`. The function then returns this sorted list. The functionality does not cover potential edge cases such as handling empty lists or non-list inputs.
