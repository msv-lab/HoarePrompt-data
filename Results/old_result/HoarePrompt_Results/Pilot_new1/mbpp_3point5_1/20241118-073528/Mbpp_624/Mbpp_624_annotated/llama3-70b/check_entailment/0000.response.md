Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that takes a string parameter `s` and returns the uppercase version of the string using the `upper()` method. The annotations also confirm that the program indeed returns the uppercase version of the input string. Since the code and annotations align with the problem description and there are no edge cases mentioned that the code does not cover, we can conclude that the code is correct for all potential cases.
