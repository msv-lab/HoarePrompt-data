According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again. 

At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a list containing elements with at least 2 elements. So for the loop to execute one more time, the nested_list must have at least 3 elements. 

No other states need to be adjusted for the loop to execute one more time.
State: **`nested_list` is a list containing elements with at least 3 elements, `flat_list` is a list. If `item` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. If `item` is not a list, `item` is appended to `flat_list`**
