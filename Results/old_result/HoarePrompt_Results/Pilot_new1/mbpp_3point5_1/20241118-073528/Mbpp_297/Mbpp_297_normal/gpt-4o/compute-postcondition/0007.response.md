According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in the `nested_list`. If there is at least one more element in the `nested_list`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` contains elements with at least 1 element. To execute the loop one more time, the `nested_list` needs to have at least 2 elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **`nested_list` is a list containing elements with at least 2 elements, `flat_list` is a list. If `item` is a list, `flat_list` is extended with the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. If `item` is not a list, `item` is appended to `flat_list`**
