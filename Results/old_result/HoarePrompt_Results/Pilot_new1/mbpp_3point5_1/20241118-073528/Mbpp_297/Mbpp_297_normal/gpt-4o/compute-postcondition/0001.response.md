According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 1 element, the loop will execute. Before the loop starts, flat_list being empty does not affect the loop execution. Therefore, to ensure the loop executes, the nested_list must have at least 1 element, and the item is the first element in the nested_list.
State: **`nested_list` is a list containing elements with at least 1 element, `flat_list` is an empty list, `item` is the first element in `nested_list`**
