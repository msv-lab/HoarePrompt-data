Example Answer:
The element is appended to the flat_list. The content of the element determines the change in the flat_list. If the element is a list, it will be added as a sublist in the flat_list. If the element is not a list, it will be added as an individual element in the flat_list.
Output State: **flat_list is updated based on the type of the next element**
