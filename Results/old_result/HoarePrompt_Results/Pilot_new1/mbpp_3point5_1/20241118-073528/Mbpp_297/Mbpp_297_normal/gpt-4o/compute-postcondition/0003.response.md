Example Answer: 
The function `func_1` is applied to the `item` list, and the result is added to the `flat_list` using the `extend` method. The initial state indicates that `item` is a list, so the function `func_1` is applied to a list. The output state will depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the elements in the `item` list. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list containing elements with at least 1 element, `flat_list` is a list containing elements returned by `func_1(item)`, `item` is the first element in `nested_list`, and `item` is a list.
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list containing elements with at least 1 element, `flat_list` is a list containing elements returned by `func_1(item)`, `item` is the first element in `nested_list`, and `item` is a list**
