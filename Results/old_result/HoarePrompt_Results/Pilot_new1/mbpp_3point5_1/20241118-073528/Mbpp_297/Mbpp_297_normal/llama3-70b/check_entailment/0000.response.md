Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The code provided correctly follows the problem description. The function `func_1` takes a nested list as input and recursively flattens the nested list structure by iterating through each element. If the element is a list, it applies `func_1` recursively to that element and appends the result to the flattened list. If the element is not a list, it directly appends the element to the flattened list. This process continues until all nested lists are flattened, and the function returns the flattened list. The code handles all potential cases mentioned in the problem description and works as expected.
