The function func_1 accepts a parameter nested_list, which is a list that may contain nested lists. It recursively flattens the nested list structure by iterating through each element of nested_list. If an element is a list, it applies func_1 recursively to that element and appends the result to the flattened list flat_list. If an element is not a list, it directly appends the element to flat_list. The function then returns the flattened list flat_list.
