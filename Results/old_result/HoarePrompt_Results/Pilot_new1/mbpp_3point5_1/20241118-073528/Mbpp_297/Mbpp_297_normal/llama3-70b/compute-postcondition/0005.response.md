Example Answer:
The `element` is appended to the `flat_list`. As `flat_list` is initially empty and `element` is not a list, the `element` will be added as a single element to `flat_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a list that contains at least 1 element, flat_list is a list containing the appended element.
Output State: **nested_list is a list that contains at least 1 element, flat_list is a list containing the appended element**
