Example Answer: 
The function `func_1` is called with the `element` as an argument, and the result is extended to the `flat_list`. The `flat_list` is modified based on the type of the `element` in the `nested_list`. The specific changes depend on the implementation of `func_1` and the type of `element`. The states of other variables are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list contains more elements, flat_list is appropriately modified based on the type of the next element in nested_list.
Output State: **nested_list contains more elements, flat_list is appropriately modified based on the type of the next element in nested_list**
