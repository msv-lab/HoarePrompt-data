According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in nested_list. If the next element in nested_list is a list, then func_1 is applied to the element and the result is appended to flat_list. If the next element in nested_list is not a list, then the element is directly appended to flat_list. 

At the end of the last iteration, nested_list contains more elements. To adjust the states for the loop to execute one more time, we need to consider the next element in nested_list:
- If the next element in nested_list is a list, then func_1 should be applied to that element and the result should be appended to flat_list.
- If the next element in nested_list is not a list, then that element should be directly appended to flat_list.

Therefore, the states need to be adjusted based on the type of the next element in nested_list, ensuring that flat_list is updated correctly for all possible cases and edge scenarios.
State: **Adjust based on the type of the next element in nested_list to ensure correct application of func_1 and appending to flat_list**
