According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If there are more elements in nested_list, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list contains at least 1 element, and flat_list is modified based on the type of the first element in nested_list.

To execute the loop one more time, the nested_list must contain more elements. If the first element in nested_list is a list, flat_list should contain the elements returned by func_1(element) where element is the next element in nested_list. If the first element in nested_list is not a list, flat_list should contain the appended next element in nested_list.

State: **nested_list contains more elements, flat_list is appropriately modified based on the type of the next element in nested_list**
