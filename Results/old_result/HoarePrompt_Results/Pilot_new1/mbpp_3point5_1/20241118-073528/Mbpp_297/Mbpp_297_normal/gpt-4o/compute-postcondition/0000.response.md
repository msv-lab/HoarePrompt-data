Example Answer:
The variable `flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. This initialization does not affect the state of `nested_list`. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a list containing elements that are either integers or lists; `flat_list` is an empty list.
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list containing elements that are either integers or lists; `flat_list` is an empty list**
