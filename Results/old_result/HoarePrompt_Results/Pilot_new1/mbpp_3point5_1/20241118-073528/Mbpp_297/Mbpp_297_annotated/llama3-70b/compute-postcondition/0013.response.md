Example Answer:
The element variable holds the value of the third element in nested_list. By appending element to flat_list, the flat_list is updated to include the element value. The states of other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a list with at least two elements, element is the third element in nested_list; flat_list is updated to include the element value.
Output State: **nested_list is a list with at least two elements, element is the third element in nested_list; flat_list is updated to include the element value**
