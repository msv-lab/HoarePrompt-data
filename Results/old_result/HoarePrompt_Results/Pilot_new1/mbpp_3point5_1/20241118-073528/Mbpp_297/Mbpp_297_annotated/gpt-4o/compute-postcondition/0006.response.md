Postcondition: ***nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, flat_list is a list that contains all the elements of nested_list flattened. If item is a list, flat_list is extended with the result of func_1(item). If item is not a list, flat_list contains the value of item. The program ensures that all elements of nested_list are flattened into flat_list, handling all possible cases of nested lists and non-list items.***
