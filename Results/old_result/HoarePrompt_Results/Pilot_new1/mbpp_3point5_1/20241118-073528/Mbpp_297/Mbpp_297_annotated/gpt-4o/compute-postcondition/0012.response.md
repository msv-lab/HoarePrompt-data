Example Answer: 
The `flat_list` is extended by the result of calling `func_1(item)` for each `item` in the `nested_list`. The `nested_list` may contain nested lists, and `func_1(item)` processes each item recursively. After the execution, `flat_list` will contain all the elements of `nested_list` flattened up to the current iteration.
Output State: **`nested_list` is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, `flat_list` is a list that contains all the elements of `nested_list` flattened up to the current iteration.**
