Postcondition: ***nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, flat_list is a list that contains all the elements of nested_list flattened up to the current iteration. If the item is a list, the elements of that list are recursively flattened and added to flat_list. If the item is not a list, it is directly appended to flat_list. The postcondition covers all possible scenarios of adding elements to flat_list based on the type of item encountered in nested_list.***
