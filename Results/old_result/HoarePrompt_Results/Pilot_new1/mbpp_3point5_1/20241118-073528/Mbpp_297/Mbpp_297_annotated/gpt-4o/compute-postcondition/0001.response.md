According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 1 item, the loop can execute. At the start of the loop, flat_list is empty. So, for the loop to be executed the nested_list must have at least 1 item and item is the first item in the nested_list.
State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, flat_list is an empty list, item is the first item in nested_list**
