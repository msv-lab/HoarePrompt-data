Example Answer: 
The `item` is appended to `flat_list`, which contains all the elements of `nested_list` flattened up to the current iteration. The state of `nested_list` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, flat_list is a list that contains all the elements of nested_list flattened up to the current iteration with the addition of `item`.
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, flat_list is a list that contains all the elements of nested_list flattened up to the current iteration with the addition of `item`**
