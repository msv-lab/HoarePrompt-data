Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is called with `item` as a parameter, and the result is appended to `flat_list`. Since `item` is a list, `func_1` will operate on the first item of `item`. The state of `flat_list` changes by extending it with the result of `func_1(item)`. 
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 item, flat_list is extended with the result of func_1(item), item is a list**
