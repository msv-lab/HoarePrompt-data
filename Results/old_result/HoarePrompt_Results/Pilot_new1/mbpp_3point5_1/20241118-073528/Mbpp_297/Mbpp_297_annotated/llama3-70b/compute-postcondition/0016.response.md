Output State: 

nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists, flat_list is a list. The loop iterates through each element in nested_list. If the element is a list, func_1 is applied to that element and the result is added to flat_list. If the element is not a list, it is directly appended to flat_list. The final flat_list contains all elements from nested_list in a flattened structure after the loop execution. If nested_list is empty, flat_list remains empty as the loop does not execute.
