Example Answer:
The element is appended to the `flat_list`. The `nested_list` remains unchanged, and the `flat_list` now contains the appended `element`. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a list with at least one element, element is not a list, flat_list contains the appended element.
Output State: **nested_list is a list with at least one element, element is not a list, flat_list contains the appended element**
