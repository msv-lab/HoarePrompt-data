Example Answer: 
`flat_list` is initialized as an empty list. Since no elements have been added to the list, the state of `nested_list` remains unchanged. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a nested list structure where each element can be either a list or a non-list type; flat_list is an empty list.
Output State: **nested_list is a nested list structure where each element can be either a list or a non-list type; flat_list is an empty list**
