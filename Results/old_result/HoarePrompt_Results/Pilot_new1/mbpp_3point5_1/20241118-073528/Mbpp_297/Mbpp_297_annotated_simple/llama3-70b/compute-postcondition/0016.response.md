Output State: *nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 element, flat_list contains the elements returned by `func_1(element)` if element is a list. If element is not a list, flat_list contains the appended element. The program handles all cases where the element is either a list or a non-list, ensuring that the flat_list is populated correctly based on the type of element present in the nested_list. If nested_list is empty, the loop does not execute and flat_list remains empty.*
