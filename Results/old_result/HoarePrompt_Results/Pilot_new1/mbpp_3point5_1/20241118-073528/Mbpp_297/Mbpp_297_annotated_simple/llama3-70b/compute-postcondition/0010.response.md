Postcondition: ***nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 element, flat_list contains the elements returned by `func_1(element)` if element is a list or the appended element if element is not a list. The program fragment successfully handles the case where the element in nested_list is a list, in which case the elements returned by `func_1(element)` are added to flat_list. Additionally, the program fragment correctly appends the element to flat_list if the element is not a list. All possible scenarios for handling elements in nested_list have been covered, ensuring the integrity of the lists and the elements within flat_list.***
