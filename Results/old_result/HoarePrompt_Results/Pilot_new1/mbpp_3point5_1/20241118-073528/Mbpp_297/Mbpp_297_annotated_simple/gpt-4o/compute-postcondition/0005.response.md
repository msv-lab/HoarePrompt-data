Example Answer:
The `item` is appended to the `flat_list`. The `nested_list` is not affected by this operation. Therefore, the Output State is: `nested_list` is a nested list structure with at least 1 element, `flat_list` contains the `item`.
Output State: **`nested_list` is a nested list structure with at least 1 element, `flat_list` contains the `item`**
