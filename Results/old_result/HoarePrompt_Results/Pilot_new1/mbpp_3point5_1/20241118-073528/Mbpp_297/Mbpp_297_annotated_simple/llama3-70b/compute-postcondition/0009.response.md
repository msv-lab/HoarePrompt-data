Example Answer:
The element is appended to the `flat_list`, so the `flat_list` will have the element added at the end. The `nested_list` remains unchanged. 
Output State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 1 element, flat_list contains the elements returned by `func_1(element)` if element is a list or the appended element if element is not a list**
