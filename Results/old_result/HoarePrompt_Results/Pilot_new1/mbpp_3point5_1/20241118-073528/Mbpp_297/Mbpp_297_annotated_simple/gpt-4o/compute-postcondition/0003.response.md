Example Answer:
The function `func_1` is applied to the `item`, which is the first element of the `nested_list` (a list). The return value of `func_1(item)` is then added to the `flat_list` using the `extend` method. The `flat_list` is initially empty, so after execution, it will contain the elements returned by `func_1(item)`. Therefore, the Output State is: nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 1 element, flat_list contains the elements returned by func_1(item), item is the first element in the nested_list, and the first element of the nested_list is a list.
Output State: **nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 1 element, flat_list contains the elements returned by func_1(item), item is the first element in the nested_list, and the first element of the nested_list is a list**
