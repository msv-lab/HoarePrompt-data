According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 2 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 1 element, flat_list contains elements returned by func_1(item) if the first element of nested_list is a list. If the first element of nested_list is not a list, flat_list contains only that element. The item variable is the first element of nested_list. 

So for the loop to execute one more time, the nested_list must have at least 2 elements. No other states need to be adjusted.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 2 elements, flat_list contains elements returned by func_1(item) if the first element of nested_list is a list. If the first element of nested_list is not a list, flat_list contains only that element. The item variable is the second element of nested_list.**
