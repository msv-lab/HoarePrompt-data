The function func_1 accepts a nested list structure as a parameter. It recursively flattens the nested list by appending all elements to a flat_list. If an element within the nested list is also a list, it recursively flattens that sublist as well. The function returns the flat_list containing all elements from the nested list. If the nested list is empty, the function returns an empty list.
