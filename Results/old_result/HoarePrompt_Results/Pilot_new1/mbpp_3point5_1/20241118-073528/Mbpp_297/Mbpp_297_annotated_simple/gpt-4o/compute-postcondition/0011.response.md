According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the nested_list. If the nested_list has at least 3 elements, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 2 elements. If the first element of nested_list is a list, flat_list contains elements returned by func_1(item) where item is the second element of nested_list. If the first element of nested_list is not a list, flat_list contains only that element. Additionally, if item is a list, it is extended with elements returned by func_1(item). If item is not a list, it is appended to flat_list. So for the loop to be executed one more time, nested_list must have at least 3 elements.
State: **nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 3 elements**
