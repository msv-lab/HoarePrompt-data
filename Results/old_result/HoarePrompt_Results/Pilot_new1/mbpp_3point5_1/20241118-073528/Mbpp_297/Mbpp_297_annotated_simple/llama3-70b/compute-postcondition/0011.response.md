According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the elements in `nested_list`. If there are more elements in the `nested_list`, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `nested_list` contains at least 1 element, and `flat_list` contains the elements returned by `func_1(element)` if element is a list or the appended element if element is not a list. 

To execute the loop one more time, the next element in `nested_list` needs to be considered. If the next element is a list, `func_1(element)` will be applied to it and the elements will be added to `flat_list`. If the next element is not a list, it will be appended to `flat_list`.

State: **nested_list is a list that may contain nested lists with at least 2 elements, flat_list contains the elements returned by `func_1(element)` if element is a list or the appended element if element is not a list**
