Postcondition: ***nested_list is a nested list structure with at least 2 elements. If the first element of nested_list is a list, flat_list contains elements returned by func_1(item) where item is the second element of nested_list. If the first element of nested_list is not a list, flat_list contains only that element. Additionally, if item is a list, it is extended with elements returned by func_1(item). If item is not a list, it is appended to flat_list.***
