Correctness: **True**

Explanation: 
The given program defines a function to flatten a nested list structure. It recursively iterates through the elements of the input list, and if an element is a list, it calls itself recursively on that element. Once all nested lists are flattened, it returns the flat list.

This logic covers all potential cases of nested lists and correctly flattens them into a single list. The program follows the problem description accurately and there are no edge cases identified where the program does not work as expected. Hence, the correctness is true.
