Correctness: **True**

The code provided defines a function that takes a string as input and replaces all spaces in the string with '%20'. The function uses the `replace()` method in Python to achieve this, which aligns with the problem description. The annotations also confirm that the program returns the input string with spaces replaced by '%20. Since the code matches the problem description and the annotations, and there are no potential cases mentioned where the code might fail, we can conclude that the code is correct.
