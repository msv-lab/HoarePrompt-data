Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The code defines a function `func_1` that replaces all spaces in the input string with '%20' using the `replace` method. The function seems to align perfectly with the problem description, which asks for a function to replace all spaces in the given string with '%20'. The provided test cases also confirm that the function is working as expected for different input strings. Therefore, based on the code and the problem description, we can conclude that the code is correct and meets the requirements.
