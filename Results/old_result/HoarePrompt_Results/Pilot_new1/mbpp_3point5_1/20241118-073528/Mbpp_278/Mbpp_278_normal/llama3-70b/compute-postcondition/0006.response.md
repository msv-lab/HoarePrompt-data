Postcondition: ***`tup` is a tuple containing elements, some of which may be tuples, `elem` is the next element in `tup`. If `elem` is a tuple, the function returns the index of `elem` in `tup`. Otherwise, there is no change to the state of the program variables after the execution of the if-else block.***
