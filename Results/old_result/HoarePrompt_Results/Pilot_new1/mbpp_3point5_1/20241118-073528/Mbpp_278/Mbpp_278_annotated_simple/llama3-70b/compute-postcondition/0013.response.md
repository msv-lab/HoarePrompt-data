The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, where `tup` is a tuple containing elements, some of which may be tuples. 

Case_1: If `tup` is a tuple with at least one element and that element is a tuple, the function returns the index of the first occurrence of the tuple in `tup`. Otherwise, there is no change in the state of `tup` and `elem`.

Case_2: If `tup` is an empty tuple, the loop does not execute and there is no change in the state of the program variables. The function returns the length of the tuple `tup`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return the index of the first occurrence of a tuple within `tup` if it exists, or return the length of `tup` if it is an empty tuple.
