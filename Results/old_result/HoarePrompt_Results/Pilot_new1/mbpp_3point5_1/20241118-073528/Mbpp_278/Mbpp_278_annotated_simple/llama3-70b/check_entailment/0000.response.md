Correctness: **True**

Explanation: The function correctly iterates over the elements of the input tuple `tup` and returns the index of the first tuple element encountered. If no tuple elements are found, it returns the length of the tuple. This logic aligns with the problem description of finding the number of elements that occur before the tuple element in the given tuple. The function handles both cases where the tuple contains at least one tuple element and when it does not.
