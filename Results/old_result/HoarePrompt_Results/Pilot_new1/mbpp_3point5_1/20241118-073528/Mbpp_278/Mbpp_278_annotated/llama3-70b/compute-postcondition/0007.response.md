According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the elements in the tuple `tup`. If there is at least one more element present after `elem`, the loop will execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` is a tuple containing elements, where at least one more element is present after `elem`, and `elem` is the next element in `tup`. So for the loop to execute one more time, the state needs to be adjusted such that `elem` is the next element after the current `elem` in `tup`.
State: **`tup` is a tuple containing elements, where at least one more element is present after `elem`, `elem` is the next element in `tup`**
