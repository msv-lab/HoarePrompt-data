Output State: **`tup` is a tuple containing elements, where at least one element is a tuple. If there is at least one tuple in `tup`, the loop will return the index of the first tuple encountered. If there are no tuples in `tup`, the loop will not execute and there will be no change in the state of the program variables.**
