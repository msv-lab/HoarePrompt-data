Functionality: ** The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`, which is a tuple containing elements. If there is at least one tuple in `tup`, the function will loop through the elements and return the index of the first tuple encountered. If there are no tuples in `tup`, the function will return the length of the tuple `tup`. Therefore, the functionality is to either return the index of the first tuple or the length of the tuple `tup` depending on the presence of tuples in the input tuple. **
