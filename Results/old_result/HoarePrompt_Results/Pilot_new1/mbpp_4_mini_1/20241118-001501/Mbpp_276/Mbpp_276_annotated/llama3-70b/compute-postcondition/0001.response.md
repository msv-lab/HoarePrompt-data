The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. After executing the function body, the function calculates the volume of a cylinder using the formula π * radius² * height and returns this value. Therefore, the functionality of the function func_1 is to accept two non-negative real numbers, `radius` and `height`, and return the calculated volume of a cylinder based on these inputs.

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters radius and height, both of which are non-negative real numbers, and returns the volume of a cylinder calculated as π * radius² * height.**
