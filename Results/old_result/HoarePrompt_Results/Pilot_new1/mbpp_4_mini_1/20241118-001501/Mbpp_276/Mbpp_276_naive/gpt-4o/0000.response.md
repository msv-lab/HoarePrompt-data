Correctness: **False**.

The provided function `func_1` does not handle the case where the radius or height is negative, which is not physically meaningful for a cylinder. If either the radius or height is negative, the function would still compute a volume based on the formula, which could yield a negative volume, leading to incorrect results. For example, `func_1(-1, 5)` would return a negative volume, which is not valid for a cylinder. Therefore, the program does not meet the requirements of the problem description for all potential cases.
