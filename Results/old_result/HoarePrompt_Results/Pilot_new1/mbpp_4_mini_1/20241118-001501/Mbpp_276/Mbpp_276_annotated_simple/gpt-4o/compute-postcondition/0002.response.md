The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. The function calculates the volume using the formula `math.pi * radius`, but it does not take `height` into account in the output. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative real numbers `radius` and `height`, and return the volume calculated as `math.pi * radius`. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters radius and height, and returns the volume calculated as math.pi * radius.**
