The variable `volume` is assigned the value calculated by the formula `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`. Given that `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers, `volume` will also be a non-negative real number. The states of the other variables are not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `radius` is a non-negative real number, `height` is a non-negative real number, and `volume` is calculated as `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height`.

Output State: **`radius` is a non-negative real number, `height` is a non-negative real number, and `volume` is calculated as `math.pi * radius ** 2 * height**
