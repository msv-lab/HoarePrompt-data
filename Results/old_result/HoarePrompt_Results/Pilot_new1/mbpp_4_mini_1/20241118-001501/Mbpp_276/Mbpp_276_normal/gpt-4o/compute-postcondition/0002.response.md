The function `func_1` accepts two parameters: `radius` and `height`. Both `radius` and `height` are non-negative real numbers. The function returns the volume calculated as `math.pi * radius`. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept non-negative real numbers `radius` and `height` and return the volume based on the given radius. 

Functionality: **The function accepts parameters `radius` and `height`, both non-negative real numbers, and returns the volume calculated as `math.pi * radius`.**
