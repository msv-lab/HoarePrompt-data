The function accepts two parameters, `radius` and `height`, both of which should be non-negative real numbers. It calculates and returns the volume of a cylinder using the formula \( \pi \times \text{radius}^2 \times \text{height} \). Note that the function does not handle cases where `radius` or `height` are negative, which could lead to incorrect or undefined behavior.
