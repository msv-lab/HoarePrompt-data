Correctness: **False**

The program does not import the `math` module, which is necessary to use `math.pi`. Without this import, any attempt to call `func_1` with valid radius and height values will result in a `NameError` because `math` is not defined. 

For example, calling `func_1(3, 5)` would raise an error:

```python
func_1(3, 5)  # This will raise NameError: name 'math' is not defined
```

Since the program fails to handle this case, it does not meet the requirements of the problem description.
