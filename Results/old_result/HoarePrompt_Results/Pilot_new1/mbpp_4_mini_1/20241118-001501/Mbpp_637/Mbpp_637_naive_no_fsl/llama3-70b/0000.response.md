Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the logic to check whether the given amount has no profit and no loss. The function `func_1` returns `True` if the cost price is equal to the selling price, which is the condition for having no profit and no loss. 

There are no edge cases or scenarios where this logic would fail, as the equality check directly addresses the problem description. Therefore, the program works correctly for all potential cases.
