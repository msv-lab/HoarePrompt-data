The provided program is intended to check whether the given cost price and selling price result in no profit and no loss. The function `func_1` returns `True` if the `cost_price` and `selling_price` are equal, and `False` otherwise.

Examining the code:
```python
def func_1(cost_price, selling_price):
    return cost_price == selling_price
```
The function checks for equality between the two parameters. This means it correctly identifies when there is no profit or loss, as profit or loss occurs only when there is a difference between the cost price and selling price.

The output hints state that the function accepts two parameters and returns `True` if they are equal; otherwise, it returns `False`. It also mentions that the function does not handle any edge cases or exceptions related to the types of the inputs.

Now, let's analyze potential edge cases:
1. The function does not check if the inputs are of the correct type (e.g., integers or floats). If a string or other data type is passed, it could lead to unexpected behavior.
2. The function does not handle cases where the inputs are negative, which may not make sense in a cost/selling price context.
3. The function assumes that both prices are valid numerical inputs, but it does not validate or handle cases where one or both inputs are `None`.

The output hints correctly summarize the behavior of the code, but they also point out that the function does not handle edge cases or exceptions. This is a significant concern because it means the function may fail or produce incorrect results when given invalid inputs.

Given that the program does not follow the problem description for every potential case (specifically regarding input validation), I conclude:

Correctness: **False**.

Explanation: The function does not handle edge cases related to input types and values, such as negative prices or non-numeric types, which could lead to incorrect behavior and does not adhere to the problem description for all scenarios.
