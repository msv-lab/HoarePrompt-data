Correctness: **True**.

The function correctly checks whether the given cost price and selling price are equal. If they are equal, it indicates that there is no profit and no loss, which aligns with the problem description. The function will return `True` for inputs such as `(100, 100)` and `False` for inputs like `(100, 150)` or `(100, 50)`, which are consistent with the requirement to check for no profit and no loss. Since the function handles all potential cases correctly, it is deemed correct.
