Correctness: **True**

The provided function `func_1` checks whether the `cost_price` is equal to the `selling_price`. According to the problem description, the goal is to determine if there is "no profit and no loss," which occurs when the selling price equals the cost price. 

The logic in the function is straightforward:
- It returns `True` if `cost_price` is equal to `selling_price`, indicating no profit or loss.
- It returns `False` otherwise.

Since the function accurately implements this logic, it works correctly for all potential cases. There are no edge cases or scenarios where the function's behavior deviates from the problem description.

Thus, the program is correct, and I conclude that it meets the requirements outlined in the problem description.
