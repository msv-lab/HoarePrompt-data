Correctness: **False**

The program does not fulfill the requirements of the problem description. According to the problem, the function is supposed to return the last digit of the factorial of a given non-negative integer `n`. 

The annotations state that if `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0, which is correct since the last digit of any factorial from 5! onwards is indeed 0. However, for `n` values less than 5, the program claims to calculate the factorial but does not actually compute or return the last digit of the factorial for those cases. 

For example:
- If `n = 0`, the factorial is `1`, and the last digit is `1`.
- If `n = 1`, the factorial is `1`, and the last digit is `1`.
- If `n = 2`, the factorial is `2`, and the last digit is `2`.
- If `n = 3`, the factorial is `6`, and the last digit is `6`.
- If `n = 4`, the factorial is `24`, and the last digit is `4`.

The program does not return any of these last digits for `n < 5`, leading to incomplete functionality. The annotations correctly point out that the function does not return the last digit of the factorial for `n` values less than 5, which is a critical aspect of the problem description that the code does not satisfy. Therefore, the function is incorrect for these cases, confirming that the overall correctness is **False**.
