The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns `n` if `n` is less than 2. If `n` is 2 or 3, it returns `n`. If `n` is exactly 4, it returns 4. For all other values of `n` (5 or greater), it returns 0. The function does not handle negative integers or any non-integer types, which may lead to unexpected behavior if such inputs are provided.
