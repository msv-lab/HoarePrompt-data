Correctness: **False**

The provided program does not correctly handle the case when `n` is 0 or 1. According to the definition of factorial, `0!` and `1!` both equal `1`, and thus the last digit of these factorials should be `1`. However, the program does not explicitly check for these cases, and since it falls into the `else` block for `n < 5`, it calculates the factorial correctly for `n = 0` and `n = 1`, but it does not return the correct last digit for these cases.

For example:
- `func_1(0)` should return `1` (last digit of `0!`), but it would return `0` since `factorial` is initialized to `1` and the loop does not execute.
- `func_1(1)` should return `1` (last digit of `1!`), but it would return `0` for the same reason.

Thus, the program fails to produce the correct output for these inputs, demonstrating that it does not meet the problem description in all cases.
