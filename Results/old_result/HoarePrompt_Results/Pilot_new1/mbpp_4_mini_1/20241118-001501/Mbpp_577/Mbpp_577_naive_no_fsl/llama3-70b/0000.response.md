Correctness: **False**

The program does not correctly compute the last digit of the factorial for all cases. For example, if we input `5`, the factorial is `5! = 120`, and the last digit is `0`. However, the program returns `0` for any input `n >= 4`, which is incorrect. Additionally, for `n = 1`, the factorial is `1! = 1`, and the last digit should be `1`, but the program returns `1` correctly. However, it fails to handle cases like `6! = 720` (last digit `0`), `7! = 5040` (last digit `0`), and so on. 

The program does not provide the correct last digit of the factorial for all potential inputs, particularly for `n >= 5`. Thus, it is incorrect.
