Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer. If `n` is greater than or equal to 5, the function returns 0. If `n` is less than 5, the function calculates the factorial of `n` (which is 1 for `n` = 0, 1 for `n` = 1, 2 for `n` = 2, 6 for `n` = 3, and 24 for `n` = 4) and returns the last digit of that factorial (0 for `n` = 0 and 1, 2 for `n` = 2, 6 for `n` = 3, and 4 for `n` = 4).***
