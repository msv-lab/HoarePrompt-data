Postcondition: ***`n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 2 and not equal to 2 or 3. If `n` is equal to 4, the function returns 4; otherwise, it returns 0. This means the function will return 0 for all values of `n` that are greater than 4 or any non-negative integer less than 4 that is not equal to 2 or 3.***
