Correctness: **False**.

The program does not correctly handle the case when `n` is 0 or 1. According to the problem description, the function should find the last digit of the factorial of a given number. The factorial of 0 is 1, and the last digit of 1 is 1. The factorial of 1 is also 1, with the last digit being 1 as well. However, the program does not account for these cases, as it only computes the factorial for `n` values greater than or equal to 2. 

For example:
- `func_1(0)` should return 1, but the program does not handle this case.
- `func_1(1)` should also return 1, but again, the program does not handle it.

Thus, since there are inputs for which the program does not produce the correct output, it is incorrect.
