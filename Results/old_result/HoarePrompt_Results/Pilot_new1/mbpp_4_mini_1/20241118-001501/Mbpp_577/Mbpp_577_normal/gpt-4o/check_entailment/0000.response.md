To assess the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description and output hints, let's analyze the code step by step.

### Problem Description:
The task is to find the last digit in the factorial of a given non-negative integer `n`.

### Provided Program:
```python
def func_1(n):
    if n >= 5:
        return 0
    else:
        factorial = 1
        for i in range(1, n + 1):
            factorial *= i
        return factorial % 10

assert func_1(4) == 4
assert func_1(21) == 0
assert func_1(30) == 0
```

### Output Hints:
The function accepts a non-negative integer `n` and returns 0 if `n` is greater than or equal to 5. For `n` less than 5, it does not compute or return the last digit of the factorial of `n`.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **For `n >= 5`:** The function correctly returns `0`, which is the last digit of the factorial of any number greater than or equal to 5, since `5!` and higher factorials will always end with a zero due to the multiplication of 2 and 5 (which contribute a factor of 10).
  
2. **For `n < 5`:** The function computes the factorial and returns the last digit:
   - `func_1(0)` returns `1` (0! = 1).
   - `func_1(1)` returns `1` (1! = 1).
   - `func_1(2)` returns `2` (2! = 2).
   - `func_1(3)` returns `6` (3! = 6).
   - `func_1(4)` returns `4` (4! = 24).

### Edge Cases:
- The function does handle all cases for `n < 5` correctly.
- The function does not handle negative integers since the problem description specifies non-negative integers, but it does not explicitly state how negative inputs should be treated.

### Output Hints Agreement:
The output hints indicate that the function returns `0` for `n >= 5`, which aligns with the implementation. However, they also state that it does not compute or return the last digit of the factorial for `n < 5`. This is misleading because the function does compute and return the last digit for those cases, which contradicts the hint.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case because it does not handle negative integers, and the output hints incorrectly state that it does not compute the last digit for `n < 5`, despite the code doing so correctly.

Therefore, the final assessment is:

Correctness: **False**. 

The program fails to address the case of negative integers, which are not explicitly handled, and the output hints misrepresent the behavior of the function for `n < 5`.
