The variable `factorial` is assigned the value of 1. The variable `n` remains unchanged as it is a non-negative integer less than 5. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is a non-negative integer less than 5; `factorial` is 1.

Output State: **`n` is a non-negative integer less than 5; `factorial` is 1**
