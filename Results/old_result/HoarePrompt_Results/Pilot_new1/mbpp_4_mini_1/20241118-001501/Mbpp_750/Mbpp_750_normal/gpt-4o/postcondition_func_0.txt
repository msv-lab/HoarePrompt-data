The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl` converted to a list. It does not handle cases where `lst` or `tpl` are not of the expected types (i.e., `lst` should be a list and `tpl` should be a tuple), but it will raise a TypeError if the input types are incorrect.
