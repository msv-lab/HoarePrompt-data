The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tup`, and returns a new list that is the result of concatenating `lst` with the elements of `tup` converted to a list. It does not handle cases where `lst` or `tup` are not of the expected types (i.e., a list and a tuple, respectively), which could lead to a TypeError if the inputs are incorrect.
