To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's first analyze the problem description and the code.

**Problem Description:** Write a function to add the given tuple to the given list.

**Program:**
```python
def func_1(lst, tpl):
    return lst + list(tpl)
```

**Output Hints:** The function accepts a list `lst` and a tuple `tpl`, and returns a new list that is the concatenation of `lst` and the elements of `tpl` converted to a list. It does not handle cases where `lst` or `tpl` are not of the expected types (i.e., `lst` should be a list and `tpl` should be a tuple), but it will raise a TypeError if the input types are incorrect.

### Initial Assessment:
The function `func_1` takes a list and a tuple, converts the tuple to a list, and concatenates it to the original list. This seems to fulfill the requirement of adding the elements of the tuple to the list. The expected output for the assertions provided in the program matches the expected behavior.

### Edge Cases:
However, the output hints indicate that the function does not handle cases where `lst` or `tpl` are not of the expected types. For instance:
- If `lst` is not a list (e.g., a string or a dictionary), or if `tpl` is not a tuple (e.g., a list or an integer), the function will still attempt to execute, leading to unexpected behavior or TypeErrors. This means that the function does not strictly enforce the types of its inputs.

### Agreement with Output Hints:
The output hints correctly state that the function will raise a TypeError if the input types are incorrect. However, the problem description does not specify that the function should handle or validate input types, which could lead to confusion about its expected behavior.

### Conclusion:
The program does not follow the problem description for every potential case because it does not handle type checking for the inputs. Therefore, it is incorrect as it could fail in cases where the input types do not match the expected types.

Correctness: **False**. 

**Explanation:** The function does not handle cases where `lst` is not a list or `tpl` is not a tuple. For example, if `func_1("not a list", (1, 2))` is called, it will raise a TypeError, which is not handled within the function itself. Thus, the function does not meet the problem description's requirements for all potential cases.
