According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `i` and `num`. The loop will continue if `i` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3 and `num` is greater than 9. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to find the upper limit for `i`, which is `int(num ** 0.5)`. Since `num` is greater than 9, `int(num ** 0.5)` will be at least 3 (as the square root of 9 is 3). For the loop to execute again, `i` must be incremented to 4 in the next iteration, and we need to ensure that `num` is still greater than or equal to 16 (since the square root of 16 is 4).

Thus, the necessary adjustments are:
- `num` must be greater than or equal to 16.
- `i` needs to be updated to 4.

State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4**
