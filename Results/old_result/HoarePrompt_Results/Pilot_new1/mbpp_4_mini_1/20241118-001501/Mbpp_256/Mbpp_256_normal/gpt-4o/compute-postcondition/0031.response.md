According to the code, the loop iterates over the range starting from `i * i` up to `n` with a step of `i`. The current values are `i` is 3 and `n` is greater than 12. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 12.

For the loop to execute one more time, the starting point of the next iteration, which is `j`, must be less than `n`. Since `j` is currently 12, we need to calculate the next value of `j` based on the step size `i` (which is 3). The next value of `j` will be `j + i`, which is 12 + 3 = 15.

Now, we need to ensure that `j` (which will be 15) is still less than `n`. Since `n` is greater than 12, for the loop to execute again, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 15.

Therefore, we adjust the state as follows:
State: **`n` is greater than 15; `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[9]` set to `False`, `is_prime[12]` is set to `False`; `i` is 3; `j` is 15**
