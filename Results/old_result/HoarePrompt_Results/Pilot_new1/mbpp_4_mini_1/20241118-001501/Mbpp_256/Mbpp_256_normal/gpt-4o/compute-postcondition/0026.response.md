According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variable `i` and the value of `n`. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, we know that `n` is greater than or equal to 4, which means that `int(n ** 0.5)` is at least 2. 

Since the loop starts with `i` initialized to 2, we need to determine the next value of `i` for the loop to execute one more time. If `i` is currently 2, it will increment to 3 for the next iteration. 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. If `i` is 3, we need to check that `3 * 3` (which is 9) is less than `n` for the loop to execute again. Therefore, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than or equal to 9.

Thus, the adjusted states are: `i` should be 3, and `n` must be at least 9 to allow the loop to execute again.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `is_prime` is a list of length `n`, `i` is 3**
