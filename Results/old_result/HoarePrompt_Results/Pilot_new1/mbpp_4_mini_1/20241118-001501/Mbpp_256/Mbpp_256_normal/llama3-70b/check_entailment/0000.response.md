To assess the correctness of the provided program, let's analyze both the code and the output descriptions carefully.

### Problem Description:
The goal is to write a function that takes in a non-negative number and returns the number of prime numbers less than that given number.

### Function Analysis:

**Function number 1:**
```python
def func_1(n: int) -> int:
    count = 0
    for num in range(2, n):
        if is_prime(num):
            count += 1
    return count
```
**Output Description for Function 1:** 
- The function counts the number of prime numbers in the range from 2 to `n-1`.
- If `n` is less than or equal to 2, it returns 0, as there are no prime numbers in that range.
- If `n` is greater than 2, it returns the count of prime numbers found.

**Function number 2:**
```python
def is_prime(num: int) -> bool:
    if num < 2:
        return False
    for i in range(2, int(num ** 0.5) + 1):
        if num % i == 0:
            return False
    return True
```
**Output Description for Function 2:**
- The function checks if `num` is less than 2 and returns `False` if it is.
- If `num` is 2 or greater, it checks divisibility by integers up to the square root of `num`.

### Initial Assessment:
1. **Handling of `n`:** 
   - The first function `func_1` does not explicitly check if `n` is less than 2 before proceeding to count primes. However, based on the output description, it mentions that it will return 0 for `n <= 2`. This behavior is implicit in the loop `for num in range(2, n)`, which will not execute if `n <= 2`, thus returning 0 correctly.

2. **Edge Cases:**
   - If `n` is 0 or 1, the function should return 0, which it does correctly.
   - If `n` is 2, the function also correctly counts 0 primes.
   - The second function `is_prime` correctly identifies that numbers less than 2 are not prime.

### Output Hints Agreement:
- The output descriptions for both functions align with the expected behavior of the code.
- The first function correctly handles the range and counting of prime numbers, and the second function accurately determines primality.

### Conclusion:
The program correctly implements the requirements as described in the problem statement. It handles edge cases appropriately (i.e., when `n` is less than or equal to 2) and returns the correct count of prime numbers for values of `n` greater than 2.

**Correctness: **True**.** 

The code fulfills the problem description for all potential cases, and the output hints reinforce this correctness.
