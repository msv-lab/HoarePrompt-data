According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `i` and `n`. The loop iterates over the range starting from `i * i` and continues until `n`, with a step of `i`. For the loop to execute, the starting point `i * i` must be less than `n`. Given that `n` is greater than or equal to 4, we need to ensure that `i` is set such that `i * i < n`. 

Since `i` is defined as `int(n)`, we need to adjust `i` to ensure it is a valid value for the loop condition to hold. The smallest integer `i` that satisfies this is `i` must be less than or equal to the integer square root of `n`.

Thus, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `i` is a value such that `i * i < n`. The simplest case is to set `i` to the integer value of the largest integer less than the square root of `n`. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime` is a list of length `n`, `i` is an integer such that `i * i < n`, `j` is `i * i`**
