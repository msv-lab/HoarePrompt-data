According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the variables `i`, `j`, and `n`. The loop will continue as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 9, and `n` is greater than 9. For the loop to execute one more time, `j` must be updated to the next value in the sequence defined by `j = j + i`. 

Since `i` is 3, the next value of `j` would be `9 + 3 = 12`. For the loop to execute again, it is necessary that `j` (which will be 12) is still less than `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to ensure that `n` is greater than 12.

State: **`n` is greater than 12, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with `is_prime[9]` set to `False`, `i` is 3, `j` is 12**
