The code sets the `j`-th element of the `is_prime` list to `False`. Since `j` is 6, the 6th element (index 5) of `is_prime` will be set to `False`. The previous state of `is_prime` has the 5th element set to `False`, but it does not affect the assignment to `is_prime[6]`. The values of `n`, `i`, and `j` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 6, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with the 5th element (index 4) set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 6, and `is_prime[6]` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 6, `is_prime` is a list of length `n` with the 5th element (index 4) set to `False`, `i` is 2, `j` is 6, and `is_prime[6]` is set to `False**
