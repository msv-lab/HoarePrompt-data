According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j` and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i * i + 2 * i`, and `n` is greater than or equal to 4. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `j` is still less than `n`. Since `j` is currently set to `i * i + 2 * i`, for the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust `j` to be `i * i + 2 * i + i`, which is the next value of `j` in the range.

Thus, the new state needs to reflect that `j` is now `i * i + 3 * i`, while `n` remains unchanged.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `is_prime` has `is_prime[j]` set to `False`, `i` is an integer such that `i * i < n`, `j` is `i * i + 3 * i`**
