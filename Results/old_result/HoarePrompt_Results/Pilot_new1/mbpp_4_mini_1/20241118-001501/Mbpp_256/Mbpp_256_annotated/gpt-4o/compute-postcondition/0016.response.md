To determine the necessary adjustments for the loop to execute one more time, we need to analyze the current state and the loop structure.

1. The loop iterates over `i` from 2 to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.
2. The loop will execute again if `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`.
3. We know that `n` is greater than or equal to 2, which means `int(n ** 0.5)` is at least 1, allowing the loop to start with `i = 2`.

At the end of the previous iteration, since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` must be adjusted to continue the loop. 

- If `i` is currently less than `int(n ** 0.5)`, it can be incremented by 1 to allow the loop to execute again.
- If `i` is currently equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`, then for the loop to execute one more time, `i` needs to be incremented to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`, which would be the terminating condition for the loop.

Thus, we can summarize the necessary adjustment:
- `i` needs to be incremented to ensure it is within the range of the loop's condition.

Since no other states need to be adjusted based on the provided information, the final state will reflect the incremented value of `i`.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2**
