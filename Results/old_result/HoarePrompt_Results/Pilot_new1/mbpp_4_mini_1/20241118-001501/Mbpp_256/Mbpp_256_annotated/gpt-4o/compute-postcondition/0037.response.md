Output State: **If n is 0 or 1, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged with `is_prime[0]` as False and `is_prime[1]` as False. If n is 2, the loop does not execute and `is_prime` remains unchanged with `is_prime[2]` as True. If n is 3, the loop executes once with `i` equal to 2, and since `is_prime[2]` is True, `is_prime` remains unchanged. If n is greater than or equal to 4, the loop executes at least once, and for `i` equal to 2, all multiples of 2 starting from 4 up to `n` are marked as False in `is_prime`. If `i` equals 3, and if n is greater than 9, all multiples of 3 starting from 9 up to `n` are marked as False in `is_prime`. The final state of `is_prime` reflects the primality of numbers from 0 to n, with all non-prime indices marked as False.**
