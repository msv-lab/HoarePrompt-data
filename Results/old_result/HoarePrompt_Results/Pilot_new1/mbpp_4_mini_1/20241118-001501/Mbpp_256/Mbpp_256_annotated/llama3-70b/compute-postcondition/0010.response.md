According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the values of `i` and `num`. The loop iterates from `2` to `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is `3`, and `num` is greater than or equal to `2`. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `i` is less than `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`. Since `i` is currently `3`, we need to ensure that `3` is less than or equal to `int(num ** 0.5)`. This means that `num` must be greater than or equal to `9` (since `int(num ** 0.5)` must be at least `3` for `i` to be `3`).

Thus, for the loop to execute one more time, `num` must be at least `9`, and `i` should be incremented to `4` for the next iteration.

State: **`num` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 4**
