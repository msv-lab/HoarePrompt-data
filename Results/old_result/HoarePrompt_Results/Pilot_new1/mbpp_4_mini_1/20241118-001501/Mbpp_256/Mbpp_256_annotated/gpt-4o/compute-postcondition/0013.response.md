According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is `i * i + 2 * i`, and `i` is less than the square root of `n`, with `n` being greater than or equal to 2. 

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check the value of `j`. The current value of `j` is `i * i + 2 * i`. For the loop to execute again, `j` must be less than `n`. Therefore, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `j` will be updated to the next value in the range, which is `j + i`. 

Thus, we need to ensure `j` is less than `n` after the increment. The new value of `j` will be `i * i + 3 * i`. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `is_prime[0]` is False, `is_prime[1]` is False, `is_prime[i]` is True for all `i` from 2 to `n-1`, `is_prime[2]` is True, `j` is `i * i + 3 * i`, `i` is less than the square root of `n`, and `is_prime[j]` is now False.**
