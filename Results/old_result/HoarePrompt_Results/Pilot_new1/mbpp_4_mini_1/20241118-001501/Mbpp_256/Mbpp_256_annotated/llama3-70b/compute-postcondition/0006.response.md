Postcondition: ***`num` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 2. If `num` is divisible by `i`, the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If `num` is not divisible by `i`, the function does not return anything, implying that the check for primality continues beyond this point.***
