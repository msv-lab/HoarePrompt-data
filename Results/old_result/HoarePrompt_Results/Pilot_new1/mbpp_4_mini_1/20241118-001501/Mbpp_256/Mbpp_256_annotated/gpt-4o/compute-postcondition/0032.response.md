The code assigns `False` to `is_prime[j]`, where `j` is 15. The previous value of `is_prime[15]` is not mentioned, but the assignment indicates that `is_prime[15]` is now set to `False`. The values of the other variables remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, `is_prime[9]` is False, `is_prime[12]` is False, and `is_prime[15]` is set to False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 15, `is_prime[9]` is False, `is_prime[12]` is False, `is_prime[15]` is set to False**
