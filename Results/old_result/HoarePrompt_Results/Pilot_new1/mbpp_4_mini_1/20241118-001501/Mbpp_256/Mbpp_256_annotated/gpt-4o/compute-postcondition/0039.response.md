The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `n`. `n` is a non-negative integer greater than or equal to 0. 

- In Case_1, if `n` is less than or equal to 2, the function returns 0. If `n` is greater than 2, the function does not return a value (implicitly returns None).
- In Case_2, the function returns the sum of the True values in the list 'is_prime', which indicates the count of prime numbers from 0 to `n`.

Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a non-negative integer `n` and return 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is greater than 2, it returns the count of prime numbers from 0 to `n`. If the count is not calculated, it implicitly returns None. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a non-negative integer `n`, returns 0 if `n` is less than or equal to 2. If `n` is greater than 2, it returns the count of prime numbers from 0 to `n`.**
