The code sets `is_prime[j]` to `False`. The value of `j` is 4, so `is_prime[4]` is assigned the value `False`. The values of `n` and `i` are not affected by this operation. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `is_prime[4]` is set to `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and `is_prime[4]` is set to `False**
