According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the values of `j`, `i`, and `n`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`.

At the end of the last iteration, we have:
- `i` is 3
- `j` is 15
- `n` is greater than 12

For the loop to execute one more time, we need to check if the next value of `j` (which will be `j + i`) is still less than `n`. The next value of `j` will be `15 + 3 = 18`.

Since `n` is greater than 12, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 18 for the loop to execute again.

Thus, the adjusted states are:
- `j` will be updated to 18.
- `n` must be greater than 18.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 18, `i` is 3, `j` is 18, `is_prime[9]` is False, `is_prime[12]` is False, `is_prime[15]` is set to False**
