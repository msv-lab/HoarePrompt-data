Correctness: **False**

The program does not handle the case when the input `n` is less than 2. According to the problem description, the function should return the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number. However, the annotations do not specify what should happen when `n` is 0 or 1. 

1. If `n` is 0, the function should return 0 since there are no prime numbers less than 0.
2. If `n` is 1, the function should also return 0 since there are no prime numbers less than 1.

However, the current implementation does not address these cases explicitly. If `n` is less than 2, the for loop in `func_1` will not execute, and the count will be returned as 0, which is correct for `n = 2`, but the function does not handle the cases of `n = 0` or `n = 1` appropriately. 

Thus, the program does not conform to the problem description for every potential case, leading to the conclusion that it is incorrect.
