The function accepts a non-negative integer `num` and returns `False` if `num` is less than 2 or if it is divisible by any integer from 2 up to the square root of `num`. If `num` is 2 or greater and not divisible by any of those integers, it returns `True`, indicating that `num` is a prime number. Additionally, the function does not handle negative input values explicitly, but since it returns `False` for any `num` less than 2, it effectively handles negative numbers as well.
