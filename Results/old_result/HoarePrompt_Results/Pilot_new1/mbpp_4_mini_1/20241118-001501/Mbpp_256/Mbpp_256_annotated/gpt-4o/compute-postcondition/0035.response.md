Postcondition: ***`n` is greater than or equal to 2 and `i` is 3. If `is_prime[i]` is true and `n` is greater than `i * i`, then `is_prime[j]` is set to `False` for all multiples of `i` starting from `i * i` up to but not including `n`. If `n` is less than or equal to `i * i`, `is_prime` remains unchanged.***
