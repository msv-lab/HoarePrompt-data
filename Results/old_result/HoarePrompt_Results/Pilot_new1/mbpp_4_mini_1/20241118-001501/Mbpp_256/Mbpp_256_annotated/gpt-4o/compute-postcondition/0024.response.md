The loop marks multiples of `i` as non-prime in the `is_prime` array, starting from `i * i` up to `n`. Given that `n` is at least 2 and `i` is 2, the loop will execute for multiples of 2 starting from 4.

The loop will execute at least once if `n` is greater than or equal to 4 (the first multiple of `i` starting from `i * i`). If `n` is less than 4, the loop will not execute, and the `is_prime` array will remain unchanged for the indices relevant to `i`.

Output State: **If n is at least 4, the loop will mark all multiples of 2 starting from 4 up to n as False in the is_prime array. If n is less than 4, the loop does not execute, and is_prime remains unchanged for those indices.**
