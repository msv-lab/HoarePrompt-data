According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` and the computed value of `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. The loop will continue as long as `i` is less than `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`.

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4, and `n` is greater than or equal to 16. The value of `int(n ** 0.5) + 1` will be at least 5 (since `n` is at least 16, `int(16 ** 0.5) + 1 = 5`). 

For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be less than `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. Since `i` is currently 4, it is less than 5, so the loop can execute again.

After this iteration, `i` will be incremented by 1, which means `i` will become 5. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than 5.

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `i` is now 5. There are no changes needed for `n`, as it remains greater than or equal to 16.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 5**
