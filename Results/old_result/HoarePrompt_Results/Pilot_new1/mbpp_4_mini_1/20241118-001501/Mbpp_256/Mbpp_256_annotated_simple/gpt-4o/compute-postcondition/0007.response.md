According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the value of `n` and the starting point of the range defined by `i`. The loop will execute if the starting point `i * i` is less than `n`. Since we know that `i` is 2, the starting point will be `2 * 2 = 4`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be greater than 4.

Before the loop starts, `n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, and the element at index `i` of `is_prime` is `True`. We need to ensure that `n` is greater than 4 for the loop to execute. 

Thus, the adjusted state should reflect that `n` is greater than 4, and since `j` will start at `i * i`, we can initialize `j` to 4.

State: **`n` is greater than 4, `i` is 2, `j` is 4, and the element at index `i` of `is_prime` is `True`**
