The code assigns `False` to `is_prime[j]`, where `j` is 20. Since `is_prime[16]` is already set to `False`, the value of `is_prime[20]` will also be `False`. The other variables `n` and `i` remain unaffected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 20, `i` is 4, `j` is 20, `is_prime[16]` is False, and `is_prime[20]` is set to False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 20, `i` is 4, `j` is 20, `is_prime[16]` is False, `is_prime[20]` is set to False**
