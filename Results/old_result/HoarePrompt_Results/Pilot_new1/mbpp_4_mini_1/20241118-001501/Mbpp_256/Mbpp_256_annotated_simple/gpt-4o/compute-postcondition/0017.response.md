According to the code, the execution of the loop depends on the values of `i`, `n`, and `j`. The loop will execute as long as `j` is less than `n`. 

Given that `i` is 3, the starting value of `j` will be `i * i`, which is `3 * 3 = 9`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 9, the loop will execute if `j` starts at 9 and `n` is greater than 9. 

At the end of the last iteration, `j` will be incremented by `i` (which is 3) each time, but initially, `j` is 9. Therefore, for the loop to execute, we need to ensure that `n` is greater than 9 and that `j` starts at 9.

State: **`n` is greater than 9, `i` is 3, `j` is 9, `is_prime` has the first two elements set to `False`**
