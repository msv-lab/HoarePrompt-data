The value of `is_prime[j]` is assigned `False`, and since `j` is 12, `is_prime[12]` is set to `False`. The states of the other variables (`n`, `i`, and `is_prime[9]`) are not affected. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, `is_prime[9]` is False, and `is_prime[12]` is False.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 12, `i` is 3, `j` is 12, `is_prime[9]` is False, `is_prime[12]` is False**
