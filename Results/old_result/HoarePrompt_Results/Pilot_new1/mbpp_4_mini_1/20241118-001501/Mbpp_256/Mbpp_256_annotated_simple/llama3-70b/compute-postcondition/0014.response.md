Output State: **If `num` is less than 2, the loop does not execute, and the function implicitly returns None. If `num` is 2 or greater, the loop checks for divisibility of `num` by integers `i` starting from 2 up to the integer value of the square root of `num`. If `num` is divisible by any `i`, the function returns False, indicating that `num` is not a prime number. If the loop completes without finding any divisors, the function does not return anything, implying that `num` is prime. After the loop, `i` will be the next integer after the last checked value.**
