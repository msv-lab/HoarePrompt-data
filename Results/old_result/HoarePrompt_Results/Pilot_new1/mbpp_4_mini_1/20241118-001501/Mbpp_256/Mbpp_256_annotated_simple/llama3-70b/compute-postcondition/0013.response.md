According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `num`. The loop is designed to iterate from 2 to the integer value of the square root of `num`, inclusive. 

At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 4. Since `num` is 9 or greater, the square root of `num` would be at least 3 (since √9 = 3). The upper limit for the loop is `int(num ** 0.5) + 1`, which means the loop can execute while `i` is less than or equal to this upper limit.

To determine if the loop can execute one more time, we need to check if `i` (which is currently 4) is still within the bounds of the loop. Given that `i` is 4, we need to ensure that `int(num ** 0.5) + 1` is greater than 4. This means `num` must be greater than or equal to 16 (since √16 = 4, and we need `int(16 ** 0.5) + 1 = 5`).

Therefore, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to adjust the state of `num` to be at least 16, while `i` will increment to 5 for the next iteration.

State: **`num` is 16 or greater, `i` is 5**
