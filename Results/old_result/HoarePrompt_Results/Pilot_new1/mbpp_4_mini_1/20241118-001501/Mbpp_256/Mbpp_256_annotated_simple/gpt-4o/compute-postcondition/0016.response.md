According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the value of `i` in relation to `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 2, and `n` is greater than or equal to 2. The loop continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. For the loop to execute one more time, `i` must be incremented to 3. 

We also need to check if `n` is still valid for the next iteration. The condition for the loop to execute again is that `3` (the new value of `i`) must be less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. Since `n` is greater than or equal to 2, we can infer that `int(n ** 0.5)` must be at least 2 for `i` to stay within bounds. 

Since `i` is being incremented to 3, we need to ensure that `n` is such that `int(n ** 0.5)` is at least 3 for the loop to execute again. Therefore, `n` must be adjusted to be greater than or equal to 9 (since `3 * 3 = 9`).

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 9, `i` is 3, and `is_prime` has the first two elements set to `False`.**
