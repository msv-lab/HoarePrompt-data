According to the code, the loop iterates over the range from 2 to `int(n ** 0.5) + 1`. The loop will execute again as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. At the end of the last iteration, `i` is 3, and `n` is greater than or equal to 9. 

To determine the conditions for the loop to execute one more time, we need to check if `i` can be incremented while still being within the loop's bounds. The next value of `i` will be 4. We need to ensure that `4` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`.

Given that `n` is at least 9, `int(n ** 0.5)` is at least 3 (since the square root of 9 is 3). Therefore, for the loop to execute again, `n` must be at least 16 so that `int(n ** 0.5)` is at least 4.

Thus, the states that need to be adjusted are:
- `n` must be greater than or equal to 16 to allow for `i` to be 4.
- `i` will be incremented to 4.

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 16, `i` is 4**
