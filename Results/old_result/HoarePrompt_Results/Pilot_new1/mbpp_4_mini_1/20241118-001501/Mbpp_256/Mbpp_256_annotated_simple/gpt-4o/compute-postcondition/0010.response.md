The code assigns `False` to `is_prime[j]`. The value of `j` is 6, so `is_prime[6]` is set to `False`. The other variables `n`, `i`, and `is_prime[4]` remain unchanged. Therefore, the output state is: `n` is greater than 6, `i` is 2, `j` is 6, `is_prime[4]` is now `False`, and `is_prime[6]` is now `False`.

Output State: **`n` is greater than 6, `i` is 2, `j` is 6, `is_prime[4]` is now `False`, and `is_prime[6]` is now `False**
