To evaluate the correctness of the provided Python program based on the problem description, let's analyze the code and the annotations:

### Problem Description
The function should take a non-negative number and return the count of prime numbers less than the given number.

### Annotated Program Analysis

1. **Function `func_1(n)`**:
   - It initializes a `count` variable to 0.
   - It iterates over the range from 2 to `n` (exclusive).
   - For each number in this range, it checks if the number is prime using the `is_prime` function.
   - It increments the `count` for each prime number found.
   - The return value is the count of prime numbers less than `n`.

2. **Function `is_prime(num)`**:
   - It checks if `num` is less than 2. If so, it returns `False`.
   - For numbers 2 and greater, it checks divisibility from 2 up to the square root of `num`.
   - If `num` is divisible by any of these, it returns `False`; otherwise, it returns `True`, indicating that `num` is prime.

### Edge Cases
- **Input of 0**: The function `func_1(0)` will return 0 because the loop does not execute at all (no numbers less than 0).
- **Input of 1**: The function `func_1(1)` will also return 0, as there are no prime numbers less than 1.
- **Input of 2**: The function `func_1(2)` will return 0, as there are no prime numbers less than 2.

### Correctness of the Program
The program correctly handles the cases for 0, 1, and 2, returning the expected count of prime numbers (which is 0 in all these cases). For any non-negative number greater than 2, the program correctly counts the prime numbers less than that number.

### Conclusion
The program adheres to the problem description and correctly counts the number of prime numbers less than the given non-negative number for all potential cases.

Correctness: **True**
