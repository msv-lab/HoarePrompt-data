According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variables `j`, `n`, and `i`. The loop will continue executing as long as `j` is less than `n`. At the end of the last iteration, `j` is 20, `n` is greater than 20, and `i` is 4. 

To determine if the loop can execute again, we need to calculate the next value of `j`. The current value of `j` is 20, and in the next iteration, `j` will be incremented by `i` (which is 4). Therefore, the next value of `j` will be 20 + 4 = 24. 

Since `n` is greater than 20, for the loop to execute one more time, we need to ensure that `j` (which will be 24) is still less than `n`. Thus, we need to adjust the state to reflect that `n` must be greater than 24.

No other states need to be adjusted.

State: **`n` is greater than 24, `i` is 4, `j` is 24, `is_prime[16]` is False, `is_prime[20]` is set to False**
