According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the variable `n`. The loop starts at `i = 2` and continues as long as `i` is less than or equal to `int(n ** 0.5)`. For the loop to execute, `n` must be at least 2, since if `n` is 0 or 1, the loop will not run. 

Thus, for the loop to be executed, `n` must be greater than or equal to 2. At the beginning of the loop, `i` should be initialized to 2. 

State: **`n` is greater than or equal to 2, `i` is 2, `is_prime` is either empty or has the first two elements set to `False`**
