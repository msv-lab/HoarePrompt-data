According to the code, whether the loop can execute again depends on the tuple `tup`. If `tup` has at least 2 elements, the loop can execute one more time. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` has at least 1 element, and `elem` is the first element of `tup`. To execute the loop one more time, `tup` must have at least 2 elements, and `elem` should be the second element of `tup`.

State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 2 elements, `elem` is the second element of `tup`**
