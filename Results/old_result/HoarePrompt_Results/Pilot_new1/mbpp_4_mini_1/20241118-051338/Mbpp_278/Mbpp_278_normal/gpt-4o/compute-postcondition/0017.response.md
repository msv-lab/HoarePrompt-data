The function `func_1` accepts a parameter `tup`. `tup` is a tuple that may contain elements of any type. The function counts the number of non-tuple elements in `tup` until it encounters a tuple. Therefore, the functionality of the function `func_1` is to accept a tuple `tup` and return the count of non-tuple elements present in it before the first tuple element is found. 

Functionality: **The function accepts a parameter tup, which is a tuple, and returns the number of non-tuple elements in tup until the first tuple is encountered.**
