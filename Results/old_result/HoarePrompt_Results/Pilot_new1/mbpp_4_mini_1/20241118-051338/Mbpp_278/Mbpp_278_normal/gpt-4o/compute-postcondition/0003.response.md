The values of the variables do not change, but we break out of the loop or the most internal control structure we were directly inside. Therefore, the output state is: `count` is 0, `tup` is a tuple with at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element of the tuple, and `elem` is a tuple, and we break out of the most internal loop or if statement.
