The value of `count` is incremented by 1, changing its value from 3 to 4. The variable `elem` remains unchanged, and the state of the tuple `tup` is also not affected. Therefore, the Output State is: `tup` is a tuple with at least 4 elements, `count` is 4, and `elem` is the third element of `tup`.

Output State: **`tup` is a tuple with at least 4 elements, `count` is 4, and `elem` is the third element of `tup`**
