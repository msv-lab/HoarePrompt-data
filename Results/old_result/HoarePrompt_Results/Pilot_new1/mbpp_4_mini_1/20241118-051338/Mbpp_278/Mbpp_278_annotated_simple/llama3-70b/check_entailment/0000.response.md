To determine the correctness of the provided Python program, we need to analyze the code and compare it against the problem description.

### Problem Description:
The task is to write a function that finds the number of elements that occur before the first tuple element in the given tuple.

### Annotated Program:
```python
def func_1(tup):
    for elem in tup:
        if isinstance(elem, tuple):
            return tup.index(elem)
        
    #State of the program after the  for loop has been executed: If `tup` contains at least one tuple, the loop will return the index of the first tuple found in `tup`. If `tup` does not contain any tuples, the loop does not execute and there is no return value. If `tup` is empty, the loop does not execute and there is also no return value.
    return len(tup)
    #The program returns the number of elements in the tuple 'tup'
```

### Code Analysis:
1. The function iterates over each element in the tuple `tup`.
2. It checks if the current element is a tuple using `isinstance(elem, tuple)`.
3. If it finds a tuple, it returns the index of that tuple using `tup.index(elem)`.
4. If no tuple is found, it returns the length of the tuple `tup`.

### Issues with the Code:
- The function does not correctly implement the requirement of counting the number of elements that occur before the first tuple. Instead, it returns the index of the first tuple found, which does not align with the problem description.
- If `tup` contains no tuples, the function returns the length of `tup`, which is incorrect because the task is to count elements before the first tuple, not the total number of elements.
- If `tup` is empty, the function will not return any value, which is also incorrect as it should handle this case explicitly.

### Example Cases:
1. Input: `tup = (1, 2, (3, 4), 5)`  
   Expected Output: `2` (there are 2 elements before the first tuple)  
   Actual Output: `2` (correct)

2. Input: `tup = (1, 2, 3, 4)`  
   Expected Output: `0` (no tuples, should return 0)  
   Actual Output: `4` (incorrect)

3. Input: `tup = ()`  
   Expected Output: `0` (empty tuple)  
   Actual Output: No return (incorrect)

### Conclusion:
The function does not correctly implement the requirements of the problem description for various cases. Specifically, it fails to return the correct count of elements before the first tuple and does not handle edge cases properly.

Correctness: **False**
