According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple `tup`. If the tuple contains at least 1 element, the loop will execute. At the end of the last iteration, the loop will have processed all elements of the tuple. So for the loop to be executed, the tuple must have at least 1 element, and `elem` should be the first element in the tuple. 

State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least 1 element, `elem` is the first element in the tuple**
