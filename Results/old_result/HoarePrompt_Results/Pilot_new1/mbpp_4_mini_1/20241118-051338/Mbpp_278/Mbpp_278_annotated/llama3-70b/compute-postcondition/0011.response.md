Output State: **If `tup` contains at least one element and the first element is a tuple, the function returns the index of that tuple. If `tup` contains elements but none are tuples, the loop will execute for all elements without returning a value (None). If `tup` is empty, the loop does not execute, and the function returns the length of `tup`, which is 0.**
