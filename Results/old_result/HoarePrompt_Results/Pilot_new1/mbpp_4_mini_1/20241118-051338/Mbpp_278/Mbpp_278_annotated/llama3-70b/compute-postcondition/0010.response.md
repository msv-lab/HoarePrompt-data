According to the code, whether the loop can execute depends on the tuple `tup`. If `tup` contains at least 4 elements, the loop can execute again. At the end of the last iteration, `tup` has at least 3 elements, and `elem` is the third element in `tup`. For the loop to be executed one more time, `tup` must have at least 4 elements, and `elem` should be the fourth element in `tup`.

State: **`tup` is a tuple containing at least 4 elements, `elem` is the fourth element in `tup`**
