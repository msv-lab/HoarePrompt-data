Output State: **`count` is the number of elements in `tup` before the first tuple is encountered; if `tup` contains a tuple as its first element, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `tup` is empty or contains only tuples, the loop does not execute and `count` remains 0. If `tup` contains only non-tuple elements, `count` will equal the total number of non-tuple elements in `tup`.**
