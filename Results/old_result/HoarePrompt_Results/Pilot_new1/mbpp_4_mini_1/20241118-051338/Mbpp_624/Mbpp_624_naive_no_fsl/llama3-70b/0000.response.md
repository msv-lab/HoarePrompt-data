Correctness: **True**

The provided program correctly implements the requirements of the problem description, which is to convert a given string to uppercase. The function `func_1` uses the built-in `upper()` method of the string class, which accurately converts all lowercase letters in the input string to their uppercase counterparts. 

I have considered various potential cases, including:

1. An empty string: `func_1("")` returns `""`, which is correct.
2. A string with all lowercase letters: `func_1("hello")` returns `"HELLO"`, which is correct.
3. A string with mixed case letters: `func_1("HeLLo")` returns `"HELLO"`, which is correct.
4. A string with no alphabetic characters: `func_1("1234!@#$")` returns `"1234!@#$"`, which is correct as non-alphabetic characters remain unchanged.
5. A string that is already in uppercase: `func_1("WORLD")` returns `"WORLD"`, which is correct.

Since the function handles all these cases correctly and adheres to the problem description without any omissions, the program is deemed correct.
